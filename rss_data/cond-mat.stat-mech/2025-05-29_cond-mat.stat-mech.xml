      <title>The Memory Engine: Self-Organized Coherence from Internal Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuous-space realization of the Coupled Memory Graph Process (CMGP), a minimal non-Markovian framework in which coherence emerges through internal feedback. A single Brownian particle evolves on a viscoelastic substrate that records its trajectory as a scalar memory field and exerts local forces via the gradient $\nabla$ of accumulated imprints. This autonomous, closed-loop dynamics generates structured, phase-locked motion without external forcing. The system is governed by coupled integro-differential equations: the memory field evolves as a spatiotemporal convolution of the particle's path, while its velocity responds to the gradient of this evolving field. Simulations reveal a sharp transition from unstructured diffusion to coherent burst-trap cycles, controlled by substrate stiffness and marked by multimodal speed distributions, directional locking, and spectral entrainment. This coherence point aligns across three axes: (i) saturation of memory energy, (ii) peak transfer entropy, and (iii) a bifurcation in transverse stability. We interpret this as the emergence of a \textit{memory engine} -- a self-organizing mechanism converting stored memory into predictive motion -- illustrating that coherence arises not from tuning, but from coupling.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality: Solving Configurational Integrals for Crystalline Solids by Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately evaluating configurational integrals for dense solids remains a central and difficult challenge in the statistical mechanics of condensed systems. Here, we present a novel tensor network approach that reformulates the high-dimensional configurational integral for identical-particle crystals into a sequence of computationally efficient summations. We represent the integrand as a high-dimensional tensor and apply tensor-train (TT) decomposition together with a custom TT-cross interpolation scheme. This approach avoids the need to explicitly construct the full tensor, which would otherwise be computationally intractable. We introduce tailored rank-1 and rank-2 schemes optimized for sharply peaked Boltzmann probability densities, typical in crystalline solids. When applied to the calculation of internal energy and pressure-temperature curves for crystalline copper (Cu) and argon (Ar), as well as the alpha-to-beta phase transition in tin (Sn), our method accurately reproduces molecular dynamics simulation results using tight-binding, machine learning (HIP-NN), and MEAM potentials, all within seconds of computation time.</description>

      <title>Critical and Nonpercolating Phases in Bond Percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22166v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p &lt; 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Finite-size effects of the excess entropy computed from integrating the radial distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation of the excess entropy from the second-order density expansion of the entropy holds strictly for infinite systems in the limit of small densities. For the reliable and efficient computation of excess entropy, it is important to understand finite-size effects. Here, expressions to compute excess entropy and Kirkwood-Buff (KB) integrals by integrating the Radial Distribution Function (RDF) in a finite volume are derived, from which Sex and KB integrals in the thermodynamic limit are obtained. The scaling of these integrals with system size is studied. We show that the integrals of excess entropy converge faster than KB integrals. We compute excess entropy from Monte Carlo simulations using the Wang-Ramirez-Dobnikar-Frenkel pair interaction potential by thermodynamic integration and by integration of the RDF. We show that excess entropy computed by integrating the RDF is identical to that of excess entropy computed from thermodynamic integration at low densities, provided the RDF is extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit. At higher densities, differences up to 20% are observed.</description>

      <title>Cluster sizes, particle displacements and currents in transport mediated by solitary cluster waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In overdamped particle motion across periodic landscapes, solitary cluster waves can occur at high particle densities and lead to particle transport even in the absence of thermal noise. Here we show that for driven motion under a constant drag, the sum of all particle displacements per soliton equals one wavelength of the periodic potential. This unit displacement law is used to determine particle currents mediated by the solitons. We furthermore derive properties of clusters involved in the wave propagation as well as relations between cluster sizes and soliton numbers.</description>

      <title>Forager with Inertia : Better for Survival?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fate of a forager who searches for food performing simple random walk on lattices. The forager consumes the available food on the site it visits and leaves it depleted but can survive up to $S$ steps without food. We introduce the concept of inertia in the dynamics which allows the forager to rest with probability $p$ upon consumption of food. The parameter $p$ significantly affects the lifetime of the forager, showing that the inertia can be beneficial for the forager for chosen parameter values. The study of various other quantities reveals interesting scaling behavior with $p$ and also departure from usual diffusive behavior for $0.5 &lt; p &lt; 1$. In addition to numerical approach, the problem has also been studied with analytical approach in one dimension and the results agree reasonably well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For ageing systems with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise coming from the thermal bath, the form of the two-time autocorrelator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d&gt;2$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Phase-space approach to cavity field dynamics in a squeezed thermal reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems, such as a single-mode cavity field coupled to a thermal bath, typically experience destructive effects due to interactions with their noisy environment. When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.</description>

      <title>Disturbing news about the $d=2+\epsilon$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. For $N=3$, we investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch. We compute the anomalous dimension of the lightest operator that could participate in recombination, and find that it remains too heavy to allow for this scenario. This suggests that the NLSM $O(3)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(3)$ CFT, and may instead describe an alternative universality class, such as the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, corresponding to the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in $3$D. We also discuss how to generalize this analysis to $N&gt;3$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional multi-orbital Kondo lattice model and show that by tuning the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons it is possible to stabilize Kondo insulators with non-trivial spin physics. In particular, depending on the size of the exchange coupling between the local moments, we find kinetic-energy-driven transitions between a featureless Kondo insulator and a valence-bond solid or a gapless spin liquid. We also provide evidence for an unconventional continuous phase transition between two featureless Kondo insulators distinguished by their quantum numbers under reflection symmetry.</description>

      <title>Complex and tunable heating in conformal field theories with structured drives via classical ergodicity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission and absorption of energy are fundamental aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics. The heating induced by driving a many-body system is perhaps the most straightforward diagnostic of the process of equilibration, or the lack thereof. Gapless systems are particularly susceptible to drive-induced heating, and the capacity to control such heating is of experimental importance. Our study addresses this challenge in the framework of conformal field theory (CFT), for which we study families of structured drives up to the aperiodic Thue-Morse sequence. Concretely, we consider a class of spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians, where the operator evolution is governed by a non-linear classical dynamical system $\mathcal{K}$. The existence of invariant regions and fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$ leads to different levels of ergodicity breaking. Upon bridging the gap between this dynamical system and the driven CFT, we classify various dynamical phases of matter, including the heating and non-heating phases, as well as a prethermal phase with a controllably slow heating rate. We further generalize the discussion to $\eta-$random multipolar driving, characterized by $\eta-$th order multipolar correlation in time. A ``triply tunable'' parametric dependence of the prethermal lifetime arises as $K^{-2(\eta-\xi)}$, where $K$ quantifies the deviation from the preimages of the fixed points of $\mathcal{K}$, the multipolar order $\eta$, and the order of the preimages $\xi$. Upon sacrificing Hermiticity by considering SU(2) deformed CFTs, we find another non-heating phase with a non-zero measure, inaccessible via purely unitary CFTs. This is underpinned by an emergent compact subspace in the generic $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ group structure, which we also identify in the transfer matrix in non-Hermitian systems with binary disorder.</description>

      <title>Global-Local Duality of Energetic Control Cost in Multipartite Quantum Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite quantum correlated systems (MQCSs) are widely utilized in diverse quantum information tasks, where their sophisticated control inherently incurs energetic costs. However, the fundamental characteristics of these control costs remain elusive, largely due to the lack of thermodynamic descriptions capable of capturing the full complexities of MQCSs. Here, we uncover universal thermodynamic relations for arbitrary MQCSs weakly coupled to a thermal bath, establishing an intrinsic global-local duality of control costs. Using these relations, we elucidate the exact role of multipartite correlation--a defining quantum feature of MQCSs--in shaping control costs at finite times. We also demonstrate that the relative magnitude between global and local control costs is undetermined, which perplexes the cost management of MQCSs under finite-time controls. Our results are numerically corroborated with applications to experimentally realizable multi-qubit systems undergoing finite-time qubit reset processes.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Many-Body Scars in 2D Quantum Gauge Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Universal principles for sudden-quench quantum Otto engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply a simple sudden quench approximation for the unitary work strokes of a quantum Otto engine in order to provide a general analysis of its performance, applicable to arbitrary quantum models with two-body interactions. This work extends recent results for an interaction-driven Otto cycle to generic many-body interacting quantum models, providing universal bounds on their operation efficiency. From this, we demonstrate that the net work of such an engine cycle is determined entirely by interparticle correlations. Applications are demonstrated for a handful of paradigmatic many-body quantum models, including a novel engine -- with a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact two-body interactions as its working medium -- in which we leverage control over spin polarization to greatly enhance its performance compared to the unpolarized case. We then extend the analysis of interaction-driven quantum Otto engine cycles to systems where control is exerted over the strength of arbitrary quantum operators that might be present in the system Hamiltonian (such as one-body, or three-body, etc.), finding that the general principles derived for the sudden quench with two-body interactions apply universally. As an example, this is demonstrated for a conventional volumetric Otto cycle, where beneficial net work is generated by leveraging the control over the frequency of an external trap, which is a one-body operator. However, we emphasize that the results derived here apply universally to all Otto engine cycles operating under a sudden quench protocol.</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>

      <title>A theory for diffusion-controlled reactions within nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study diffusion-controlled processes in nonequilibrium steady-states, where standard rate theory assumptions break down. Using transition path theory, we generalize the relations between reactive probability fluxes and measures of the rate of the reaction. Stochastic thermodynamics analysis reveals how work constrains the enhancement of rates relative to their equilibrium values. An analytically solvable ion-pairing model under a strong electric field illustrates and validates our approach and theory. These findings provide deeper insights into diffusion-controlled reaction dynamics beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Universal critical phase diagram using Gini index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical phase surface of a system, in general, can depend on one or more parameters. We show that by calculating the Gini index ($g$) of any suitably defined response function of a system, the critical phase surface can always be reduced to that of a single parameter, starting from $g=0$ and terminating at $g=g_f$, where $g_f$ is a universal number for a chosen response function in a given universality class. We demonstrate the construction with analytical and numerical calculations of mean field transverse field Ising model and site diluted Ising model on the Bethe lattice, respectively. Both models have two parameter critical phase surfaces -- transverse field and temperature for the first case and site dilution and temperature in the second case. Both can be reduced to single parameter transition points in terms of the Gini index. We have additionally demonstrated the validity of the method for a mean field two parameter opinion dynamics model that includes a tri-critical point. The method is generally applicable for any multi-parameter critical transition.</description>

      <title>Wave front propagation in the Active Coagulation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Because of this interplay between time-scales, the wave front propagation qualitatively changes from traveling to diffusive waves. Moving beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from the Fisher-Kolmogorov to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantifying dissipation in flocking dynamics: When tracking internal states matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aligning self-propelled particles undergo a nonequilibrium flocking transition from apolar to polar phases as their interactions become stronger. We propose a thermodynamically consistent lattice model, in which the internal state of the particles biases their diffusion, to capture such a transition. Changes of internal states and jumps between lattice sites obey local detailed balance with respect to the same interaction energy. We unveil a crossover between two regimes: for weak interactions, the dissipation is maximal, and partial inference (namely, based on discarding the dynamics of internal states) leads to a severe underestimation; for strong interactions, the dissipation is reduced, and partial inference captures most of the dissipation. Finally, we reveal that the macroscopic dissipation, evaluated at the hydrodynamic level, coincides with the microscopic dissipation upon coarse-graining. We argue that this correspondence stems from a generic mapping of active lattice models with local detailed balance into a specific class of non-ideal reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix of the XXZ chain in the massless regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence, uniqueness and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergent Ising$_h^2$ integrability is anticipated in a quantum Ising ladder composed of two weakly-coupled critical transverse field Ising chains. The system is remarkable for including eight types of massive relativistic particles, with their scattering matrix and mass spectrum characterized by the $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ Lie algebra. In this article, by computing the spin dynamical structure factors following analytical form factor approach, we clearly identify dispersive single-particle excitations of (anti-) soliton and breathers as well as their multi-particle continua in the spectra, which is further confirmed by the numerical simulations. We show that the selection rule inherent in the parity and topological charge of the theory, causes a significant result that charge-parity-odd particles, termed as dark particles, cannot be directly excited from the ground state through any local or quasi-local operations. This in turn suggests the long lifetime of the lightest dark particle.</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Mean-Field Models via Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformers to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. First, we empirically demonstrate that transformers are well-suited for approximating a variety of mean field models, including the Cucker-Smale model for flocking and milling, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks. We validate our numerical experiments via mathematical theory. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer effectively approximates the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the $L_2$ distance between the \textit{expected transformer} and the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field can be uniformly bounded by a function of the number of particles observed during training. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer.</description>

Abstract: We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in the form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>

Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>

Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase-field Models of Biological Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of complex multicellular organisms from a single parent cell is a highly orchestrated process that cells conduct collectively without central guidance, creating intricate dynamic patterns essential for development and regeneration. Despite significant advances in imaging spatiotemporal dynamics of cell collectives and mechanical characterization techniques, the role of physical forces in biological functions remains poorly understood. Physics-based models are crucial in complementing experiments, providing high-resolution spatiotemporal fields in three dimensions. This review focuses on dense, soft multicellular systems, such as tissues, where mechanical deformation of one cell necessitates the re-organization of neighboring cells. The multi-phase-field model offers a rich physics-based framework to advance our understanding of biological systems and provides a robust playground for non-equilibrium physics of active matter. We discuss the foundational aspects of the multi-phase-field model and their applications in understanding physics of active matter. We also explore the integration of biological physics with experimental data, covering cell migration, heterogeneous cell populations, and confined systems. Finally, we highlight current trends, the importance of multi-phase-field models in biological and physics research, and future challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations without quantum corrections: A coherent-incoherent correspondence approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the coherent-incoherent correspondence as a framework for deriving quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations under continuous measurement in Lindblad dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence establishes a mapping between the original quantum system undergoing coherent evolution and its corresponding incoherent system without coherent dynamics. The coherent-incoherent correspondence relates quantities across these two systems, including jump statistics, dynamical activity, and entropy production. Since the classical-like properties of the incoherent system allow us to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations within it, these relations can be transferred to the coherent system via the coherent-incoherent correspondence. This enables us to derive quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the original coherent system. Unlike existing quantum uncertainty relations, which typically require explicit quantum correction terms, our approach avoids these additional terms. This framework provides a general method for deriving trade-offs in quantum thermodynamics.</description>
