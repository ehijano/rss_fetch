      <description>arXiv:2601.09748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents the installation, configuration, and operation of a full Bitcoin node in a Linux environment, from manual compilation of the source code to complete synchronization with the network. The technical phases of the process are described, the main files generated by Bitcoin Core are analyzed, and the effects of the parameters txindex, prune, dbcache, maxmempool, and maxconnections are empirically studied. System resources during the block download (IBD) mechanism are also documented, and the operational importance of each resource is explained. This paper provides a solid foundation for future research proposals on Bitcoin node performance or for the development of blockchain data query tools.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Veterinary EHR De-identification: Benefits, Limits, and Safety Trade-offs Under Fixed Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Veterinary electronic health records (vEHRs) contain privacy-sensitive identifiers that limit secondary use. While PetEVAL provides a benchmark for veterinary de-identification, the domain remains low-resource. This study evaluates whether large language model (LLM)-generated synthetic narratives improve de-identification safety under distinct training regimes, emphasizing (i) synthetic augmentation and (ii) fixed-budget substitution. We conducted a controlled simulation using a PetEVAL-derived corpus (3,750 holdout/1,249 train). We generated 10,382 synthetic notes using a privacy-preserving "template-only" regime where identifiers were removed prior to LLM prompting. Three transformer backbones (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) were trained under varying mixtures. Evaluation prioritized document-level leakage rate (the fraction of documents with at least one missed identifier) as the primary safety outcome. Results show that under fixed-sample substitution, replacing real notes with synthetic ones monotonically increased leakage, indicating synthetic data cannot safely replace real supervision. Under compute-matched training, moderate synthetic mixing matched real-only performance, but high synthetic dominance degraded utility. Conversely, epoch-scaled augmentation improved performance: PetBERT span-overlap F1 increased from 0.831 to 0.850 +/- 0.014, and leakage decreased from 6.32% to 4.02% +/- 0.19%. However, these gains largely reflect increased training exposure rather than intrinsic synthetic data quality. Corpus diagnostics revealed systematic synthetic-real mismatches in note length and label distribution that align with persistent leakage. We conclude that synthetic augmentation is effective for expanding exposure but is complementary, not substitutive, for safety-critical veterinary de-identification.</description>

      <title>A Risk-Stratified Benchmark Dataset for Bad Randomness (SWC-120) Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Ethereum smart contracts rely on block attributes such as block.timestamp or blockhash to generate random numbers for applications like lotteries and games. However, these values are predictable and miner-manipulable, creating the Bad Randomness vulnerability (SWC-120) that has led to real-world exploits. Current detection tools identify only simple patterns and fail to verify whether protective modifiers actually guard vulnerable code. A major obstacle to improving these tools is the lack of large, accurately labeled datasets. This paper presents a benchmark dataset of 1,752 Ethereum smart contracts with validated Bad Randomness vulnerabilities. We developed a five-phase methodology comprising keyword filtering, pattern matching with 58 regular expressions, risk classification, function-level validation, and context analysis. The function-level validation revealed that 49% of contracts initially classified as protected were actually exploitable because modifiers were applied to different functions than those containing vulnerabilities. We classify contracts into four risk levels based on exploitability: HIGH_RISK (no protection), MEDIUM_RISK (miner-exploitable only), LOW_RISK (owner-exploitable only), and SAFE (using Chainlink VRF or commit-reveal). Our dataset is 51 times larger than RNVulDet and the first to provide function-level validation and risk stratification. Evaluation of Slither and Mythril revealed significant detection gaps, as both tools identified none of the vulnerable contracts in our sample, indicating limitations in handling complex randomness patterns. The dataset and validation scripts are publicly available to support future research in smart contract security.</description>

      <title>AmbShield: Enhancing Physical Layer Security with Ambient Backscatter Devices against Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive eavesdropping compromises confidentiality in wireless networks, especially in resource-constrained environments where heavyweight cryptography is impractical. Physical layer security (PLS) exploits channel randomness and spatial selectivity to confine information to an intended receiver with modest overhead. However, typical PLS techniques, such as using beamforming, artificial noise, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, often involve added active power or specialized deployment, and, in many designs, rely on precise time synchronization and perfect CSI estimation, which limits their practicality. To this end, we propose AmbShield, an AmBD-assisted PLS scheme that leverages naturally distributed AmBDs to simultaneously strengthen the legitimate channel and degrade eavesdroppers' without requiring extra transmit power and with minimal deployment overhead. In AmbShield, AmBDs are exploited as friendly jammers that randomly backscatter to create interference at eavesdroppers, and as passive relays that backscatter the desired signal to enhance the capacity of legitimate devices. We further develop a unified analytical framework that analyzes the exact probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of legitimate and eavesdropper signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), and a closed-form secrecy outage probability (SOP). The analysis provides clear design guidelines on various practical system parameters to minimize SOP. Extensive experiments that include Monte Carlo simulations, theoretical derivations, and high-SNR asymptotic analysis demonstrate the security gains of AmbShield across diverse system parameters under imperfect synchronization and CSI estimation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Contrastive Loss for Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in network intrusion detection; however, its performance significantly degrades when confronted by a new attack class -- a zero-day attack. In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Malware Classification using Diluted Convolutional Neural Network with Fast Gradient Sign Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Android malware has become an increasingly critical threat to organizations, society and individuals, posing significant risks to privacy, data security and infrastructure. As malware continues to evolve in terms of complexity and sophistication, the mitigation and detection of these malicious software instances have become more time consuming and challenging particularly due to the requirement of large number of features to identify potential malware. To address these challenges, this research proposes Fast Gradient Sign Method with Diluted Convolutional Neural Network (FGSM DICNN) method for malware classification. DICNN contains diluted convolutions which increases receptive field, enabling the model to capture dispersed malware patterns across long ranges using fewer features without adding parameters. Additionally, the FGSM strategy enhance the accuracy by using one-step perturbations during training that provides more defensive advantage of lower computational cost. This integration helps to manage high classification accuracy while reducing the dependence on extensive feature sets. The proposed FGSM DICNN model attains 99.44% accuracy while outperforming other existing approaches such as Custom Deep Neural Network (DCNN).</description>

      <title>SoK: Privacy-aware LLM in Healthcare: Threat Model, Privacy Techniques, Challenges and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in healthcare to support clinical decision-making, summarize electronic health records (EHRs), and enhance patient care. However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities. While existing defenses show promise, our analysis identifies persistent limitations in securing sensitive clinical data across diverse operational tiers. We conclude with phase-aware recommendations and future research directions aimed at strengthening privacy guarantees for LLMs in regulated environments. This work provides a foundation for understanding the intersection of LLMs, threats, and privacy in healthcare, offering a roadmap toward more robust and clinically trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>Privacy Enhanced PEFT: Tensor Train Decomposition Improves Privacy Utility Tradeoffs under DP-SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on sensitive data poses significant privacy risks, as membership inference attacks can reveal whether individual records were used during training. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal protection, applying DP to conventional Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) often incurs substantial utility loss. In this work, we show that a more structurally constrained PEFT architecture, Tensor Train Low-Rank Adaptation (TTLoRA), can improve the privacy-utility tradeoff by shrinking the effective parameter space while preserving expressivity. To this end, we develop TTLoRA-DP, a differentially private training framework for TTLoRA. Specifically, we extend the ghost clipping algorithm to Tensor Train cores via cached contraction states, enabling efficient Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) with exact per-example gradient norm computation without materializing full per-example gradients. Experiments on GPT-2 fine-tuning over the Enron and Penn Treebank datasets show that TTLoRA-DP consistently strengthens privacy protection relative to LoRA-DP while maintaining comparable or better downstream utility. Moreover, TTLoRA exhibits lower membership leakage even without DP training, using substantially smaller adapters and requiring on average 7.6X fewer parameters than LoRA. Overall, our results demonstrate that TTLoRA offers a practical path to improving the privacy-utility tradeoff in parameter-efficient language model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Fuzzychain-edge: A novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid integration of IoT with edge computing has revolutionized various domains, particularly healthcare, by enabling real-time data sharing, remote monitoring, and decision-making. However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes. The proposed framework addresses key challenges by enhancing security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, and providing a transparent audit trail of data transactions. Expected outcomes include improved data privacy, accuracy in access control, and increased user trust in IoT systems. This research contributes significantly to advancing privacy-preserving, secure, and traceable solutions in IoT environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations in decentralized technologies and their applications in critical domains such as healthcare and beyond.</description>

      <title>Advanced Encryption Technique for Multimedia Data Using Sudoku-Based Algorithms for Enhanced Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encryption and Decryption is the process of sending a message in a ciphered way that appears meaningless and could be deciphered using a key for security purposes to avoid data breaches. This paper expands on the previous work on Sudoku-based encryption methods, applying it to other forms of media including images, audio and video. It also enhances the security of key generation and usage by making it dependent on the timestamp of when the message was transmitted. It is a versatile system that works on multimodal data and functions as a block-based transposition cipher. Instead of shuffling, it can also employ substitution methods like XOR, making it a substitution cipher. The resulting media are highly encrypted and resilient to brute-force and differential attacks. For images, NPCR values approach 100% and for audio, SNR values exceed 60dB. This makes the encrypted audio significantly different from the source, making decryption more difficult.</description>

      <title>ReasAlign: Reasoning Enhanced Safety Alignment against Prompt Injection Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of powerful agentic systems capable of automating complex workflows across various fields. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external data can hijack agent behavior. In this work, we present ReasAlign, a model-level solution to improve safety alignment against indirect prompt injection attacks. The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR). These results demonstrate that ReasAlign achieves the best trade-off between security and utility, establishing a robust and practical defense against prompt injection attacks in real-world agentic systems. Our code and experimental results could be found at https://github.com/leolee99/ReasAlign.</description>

      <title>PADER: Paillier-based Secure Decentralized Social Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of recommendation systems also brings privacy concerns to both the users and the sellers, as centralized platforms collect as much data as possible from them. To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes &lt;3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications. The code is available at https://github.com/GarminQ/PADER.</description>

      <title>XuanJia: A Comprehensive Virtualization-Based Code Obfuscator for Binary Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtualization-based binary obfuscation is widely adopted to protect software intellectual property, yet existing approaches leave exception-handling (EH) metadata unprotected to preserve ABI compatibility. This exposed metadata leaks rich structural information, such as stack layouts, control-flow boundaries, and object lifetimes, which can be exploited to facilitate reverse engineering. In this paper, we present XuanJia, a comprehensive VM-based binary obfuscation framework that provides end-to-end protection for both executable code and exception-handling semantics. At the core of XuanJia is ABI-Compliant EH Shadowing, a novel exception-aware protection mechanism that preserves compatibility with unmodified operating system runtimes while eliminating static EH metadata leakage. XuanJia replaces native EH metadata with ABI-compliant shadow unwind information to satisfy OS-driven unwinding, and securely redirects exception handling into a protected virtual machine where the genuine EH semantics are decrypted, reversed, and replayed using obfuscated code. We implement XuanJia from scratch, supporting 385 x86 instruction encodings and 155 VM handler templates, and design it as an extensible research testbed. We evaluate XuanJia across correctness, resilience, and performance dimensions. Our results show that XuanJia preserves semantic equivalence under extensive dynamic and symbolic testing, effectively disrupts automated reverse-engineering tools such as IDA Pro, and incurs negligible space overhead and modest runtime overhead. These results demonstrate that XuanJia achieves strong protection of exception-handling logic without sacrificing correctness or practicality.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Hijacking: Subverting LLM Classification via Decision-Criteria Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current LLM safety research predominantly focuses on mitigating Goal Hijacking, preventing attackers from redirecting a model's high-level objective (e.g., from "summarizing emails" to "phishing users"). In this paper, we argue that this perspective is incomplete and highlight a critical vulnerability in Reasoning Alignment. We propose a new adversarial paradigm: Reasoning Hijacking and instantiate it with Criteria Attack, which subverts model judgments by injecting spurious decision criteria without altering the high-level task goal. Unlike Goal Hijacking, which attempts to override the system prompt, Reasoning Hijacking accepts the high-level goal but manipulates the model's decision-making logic by injecting spurious reasoning shortcut. Though extensive experiments on three different tasks (toxic comment, negative review, and spam detection), we demonstrate that even newest models are prone to prioritize injected heuristic shortcuts over rigorous semantic analysis. The results are consistent over different backbones. Crucially, because the model's "intent" remains aligned with the user's instructions, these attacks can bypass defenses designed to detect goal deviation (e.g., SecAlign, StruQ), exposing a fundamental blind spot in the current safety landscape.

      <title>Agent Skills in the Wild: An Empirical Study of Security Vulnerabilities at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p&lt;0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.</description>

      <title>AgentGuardian: Learning Access Control Policies to Govern AI Agent Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly used in a variety of domains to automate tasks, interact with users, and make decisions based on data inputs. Ensuring that AI agents perform only authorized actions and handle inputs appropriately is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing misuse. In this study, we introduce the AgentGuardian, a novel security framework that governs and protects AI agent operations by enforcing context-aware access-control policies. During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality. Moreover, its control-flow-based governance mechanism mitigates hallucination-driven errors and other orchestration-level malfunctions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Encryption with Certified Deletion in Preprocessing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certified deletion allows Alice to outsource data to Bob and, at a later time, obtain a verifiable guarantee that the file has been irreversibly deleted at her request. The functionality, while impossible using classical information alone, can be achieved using quantum information. Existing approaches, rely on one-time pad (OTP) encryption, or use computational hardness assumptions that may be vulnerable to future advances in classical or quantum computing. In this work, we introduce and formalize hybrid encryption with certified deletion in the preprocessing model (pHE-CD) and propose two constructions. The constructions combine an information-theoretic key encapsulation mechanism (iKEM) with a data encapsulation mechanism that provides certified deletion (DEM-CD) and, respectively, provide {\em information-theoretic certified deletion}, where both confidentiality and deletion properties are provided against a computationally unbounded adversary; and {\em everlasting certified deletion}, where confidentiality is computational before deletion, and upon successful verification of the deletion certificate, the message becomes information-theoretically hidden from an adversary that is computationally unbounded. Our pHE-CD schemes provide IND-$q_e$-CPA notion of security and support encryption of arbitrarily long messages. In the second construction, using a computationally secure DEM-CD that is quantum-safe (i.e. constructed using quantum coding and AES), we obtain quantum-safe security with keys that are significantly shorter than the message. Instantiating the proposed framework using quantum enabled kem (qKEM) as the iKEM, is a future work.</description>

      <title>Be Your Own Red Teamer: Safety Alignment via Self-Play and Reflective Experience Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial ``jailbreak'' attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails. Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weil pairing on elliptic curves has deep links with discrete logarithm problems. In practice, to better suit the functionalities of cryptosystems, one often needs to modify the original Weil pairing via what is called a distortion map. We propose a study on the question of the existence of distortion maps for elliptic curves over finite fields. We revisit results from the literature and provide detailed proofs. We also propose new perspectives at times.</description>

      <title>Interpolation-Based Optimization for Enforcing lp-Norm Metric Differential Privacy in Continuous and Fine-Grained Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) generalizes Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by adapting privacy guarantees based on pairwise distances, enabling context-aware protection and improved utility. While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.
  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

      <title>Private Information Retrieval for Graph-based Replication with Minimal Subpacketization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design new minimal-subpacketization schemes for information-theoretic private information retrieval on graph-based replicated databases. In graph-based replication, the system consists of $K$ files replicated across $N$ servers according to a graph with $N$ vertices and $K$ edges. The client wants to retrieve one desired file, while keeping the index of the desired file private from each server via a query-response protocol. We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets. This scheme achieves a rate lower than prior schemes for the complete graph, however it can achieve higher rates than known for some specific graph classes. An extension of our scheme to the case of multigraphs achieves a higher rate than previous schemes for the complete multi-graph.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations of Favorable Privacy-Utility Guarantees for DP-SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $\kappa$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $\kappa$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $\sigma$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy
  $\sigma \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln M}}$ $\quad\text{or}\quad$ $\kappa \ge\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\!\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\ln M}}\right)$,
  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \to \infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.</description>

      <title>LADFA: A Framework of Using Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Personal Data Flow Analysis in Privacy Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Inference for Longitudinal Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for releasing statistics while protecting individual information present in a dataset. Although substantial progress has been made on differentially private linear regression, existing methods almost exclusively address the item-level DP setting, where each user contributes a single observation. Many scientific and economic applications instead involve longitudinal or panel data, in which each user contributes multiple dependent observations. In these settings, item-level DP offers inadequate protection, and user-level DP - shielding an individual's entire trajectory - is the appropriate privacy notion. We develop a comprehensive framework for estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under user-level DP. We propose a user-level private regression estimator based on aggregating local regressions, and we establish finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic normality under short-range dependence. For inference, we develop a privatized, bias-corrected covariance estimator that is automatically heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent. These results provide the first unified framework for practical user-level DP estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under dependence, with strong theoretical guarantees and promising empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Converse Bounds for Sun-Jafar-type Weak Private Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the well-established capacity-achieving schemes of Sun-Jafar (for replicated storage) and the closely related scheme of Banawan-Ulukus (for MDS-coded setting), a recent work by Chandan et al. proposed new classes of weak private information retrieval (WPIR) schemes for the collusion-free (replication and MDS-coded) setting, as well as for the $T$-colluding scenario. In their work, Chandan et al. characterized the expressions for the rate-privacy trade-offs for these classes of WPIR schemes, under the mutual information leakage and maximal leakage metrics. Explicit achievable trade-offs for the same were also presented, which were shown to be competitive or better than prior WPIR schemes. However, the class-wise optimality of the reported trade-offs were unknown. In this work, we show that the explicit rate-privacy trade-offs reported for the Sun-Jafar-type schemes by Chandan et al. are optimal for the non-colluding and replicated setting. Furthermore, we prove the class-wise optimality for Banawan-Ulukus-type MDS-WPIR and Sun-Jafar-type $T$-colluding WPIR schemes, under threshold-constraints on the system parameters. When these threshold-constraints do not hold, we present counter-examples which show that even higher rates than those reported before can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Out of Distribution, Out of Luck: How Well Can LLMs Trained on Vulnerability Datasets Detect Top 25 CWE Weaknesses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21817v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated vulnerability detection research has made substantial progress, yet its real-world impact remains limited. Prior work found that current vulnerability datasets suffer from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20%-71%, extensive duplication, and poor coverage of critical Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). These issues create a significant generalization gap where models achieve misleading In-Distribution (ID) accuracies (testing on splits from the same dataset) by exploiting spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns.
  To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we introduce BenchVul, which is a manually curated and balanced test dataset covering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs, to enable fair model evaluation. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 38,548 functions by aggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM pipeline. Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) pipeline, which synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through simulated development workflows.
  Our evaluation reveals that In-Distribution (ID) performance does not reliably predict Out-of-Distribution (OOD) performance on BenchVul. For example, a model trained on BigVul achieves the highest 0.703 ID accuracy but fails on BenchVul's real-world samples (0.493 OOD accuracy). Conversely, a model trained on our TitanVul achieves the highest OOD performance on both the real-world (0.881) and synthesized (0.785) portions of BenchVul, improving upon the next-best performing dataset by 5.3% and 11.8% respectively, despite a modest ID score (0.590). Augmenting TitanVul with our RVG further boosts this leading OOD performance, improving accuracy on real-world data by 5.8% (to 0.932).</description>

      <title>UEChecker: Detecting Unchecked External Call Vulnerabilities in DApps via Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph, extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>MultiCFV: Detecting Control Flow Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts Leveraging Multimodal Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: The introduction of smart contract functionality marks the advent of the blockchain 2.0 era, enabling blockchain technology to support digital currency transactions and complex distributed applications. However, many smart contracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the loss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or bytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy, and limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and detect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in smart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control flow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features. Abstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments capture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors are fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect similar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic information, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection and clone detection.</description>

      <title>NATLM: Detecting Defects in NFT Smart Contracts Leveraging LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid evolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets, they have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of NFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to substantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect potential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies four common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721 Reentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a high false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates static analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM employs static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow information from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Control Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with vectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the knowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the analyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base. Finally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection capabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of potential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed 8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%, a recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other baseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.</description>

      <title>Network-Level Prompt and Trait Leakage in Local Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language-model-based systems that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference attacks by passive network observers. Deployment of WRAs \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or financial purposes exposes them to DNS resolvers, malicious ISPs, VPNs, web proxies, and corporate or government firewalls. However, unlike sporadic and scarce web browsing by humans, WRAs visit $70{-}140$ domains per each request with a distinct timing pattern creating unique privacy risks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces based on real user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over 73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.</description>

      <title>MindGuard: Intrinsic Decision Inspection for Securing LLM Agents Against Metadata Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is increasingly adopted to standardize the interaction between LLM agents and external tools. However, this trend introduces a new threat: Tool Poisoning Attacks (TPA), where tool metadata is poisoned to induce the agent to perform unauthorized operations. Existing defenses that primarily focus on behavior-level analysis are fundamentally ineffective against TPA, as poisoned tools need not be executed, leaving no behavioral trace to monitor.
  Thus, we propose MindGuard, a decision-level guardrail for LLM agents, providing provenance tracking of call decisions, policy-agnostic detection, and poisoning source attribution against TPA. While fully explaining LLM decision remains challenging, our empirical findings uncover a strong correlation between LLM attention mechanisms and tool invocation decisions. Therefore, we choose attention as an empirical signal for decision tracking and formalize this as the Decision Dependence Graph (DDG), which models the LLM's reasoning process as a weighted, directed graph where vertices represent logical concepts and edges quantify the attention-based dependencies. We further design robust DDG construction and graph-based anomaly analysis mechanisms that efficiently detect and attribute TPA attacks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MindGuard achieves 94\%-99\% average precision in detecting poisoned invocations, 95\%-100\% attribution accuracy, with processing times under one second and no additional token cost. Moreover, DDG can be viewed as an adaptation of the classical Program Dependence Graph (PDG), providing a solid foundation for applying traditional security policies at the decision level.</description>

      <title>ZK-SenseLM: Verifiable Large-Model Wireless Sensing with Selective Abstention and Zero-Knowledge Attestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ZK-SenseLM is a secure and auditable wireless sensing framework that pairs a large-model encoder for Wi-Fi channel state information (and optionally mmWave radar or RFID) with a policy-grounded decision layer and end-to-end zero-knowledge proofs of inference. The encoder uses masked spectral pretraining with phase-consistency regularization, plus a light cross-modal alignment that ties RF features to compact, human-interpretable policy tokens. To reduce unsafe actions under distribution shift, we add a calibrated selective-abstention head; the chosen risk-coverage operating point is registered and bound into the proof. We implement a four-stage proving pipeline: (C1) feature sanity and commitment, (C2) threshold and version binding, (C3) time-window binding, and (C4) PLONK-style proofs that the quantized network, given the committed window, produced the logged action and confidence. Micro-batched proving amortizes cost across adjacent windows, and a gateway option offloads proofs from low-power devices. The system integrates with differentially private federated learning and on-device personalization without weakening verifiability: model hashes and the registered threshold are part of each public statement. Across activity, presence or intrusion, respiratory proxy, and RF fingerprinting tasks, ZK-SenseLM improves macro-F1 and calibration, yields favorable coverage-risk curves under perturbations, and rejects tamper and replay with compact proofs and fast verification.</description>

      <title>PrivCode: When Code Generation Meets Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have presented outstanding performance in code generation and completion. However, fine-tuning these models on private datasets can raise privacy and proprietary concerns, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information. Differentially private (DP) code generation provides theoretical guarantees for protecting sensitive code by generating synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while reducing privacy leakage concerns. However, DP code generation faces significant challenges due to the strict syntactic dependencies and the privacy-utility trade-off.
  We propose PrivCode, the first DP synthesizer specifically designed for code datasets. It incorporates a two-stage framework to improve both privacy and utility. In the first stage, termed "privacy-sanitizing", PrivCode generates DP-compliant synthetic code by training models using DP-SGD while introducing syntactic information to preserve code structure. The second stage, termed "utility-boosting", fine-tunes a larger pre-trained LLM on the synthetic privacy-free code to mitigate the utility loss caused by DP, enhancing the utility of the generated code. Extensive experiments on four LLMs show that PrivCode generates higher-utility code across various testing tasks under four benchmarks. The experiments also confirm its ability to protect sensitive data under varying privacy budgets. We provide the replication package at the anonymous link.</description>

      <title>JEEVHITAA -- An End-to-End HCAI System to Support Collective Care</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current mobile health platforms are predominantly individual-centric and lack the support for coordinated, auditable multi-actor workflows. However, in many settings worldwide, health decisions are enacted by multi-actor care networks rather than single users. We present JEEVHITAA, a cross-platform mobile system enabling role-aware sharing and verifiable information flows within permissioned care circles. JEEVHITAA ingests platform and device data (Health-Connect, BLE), builds layered profiles from sensors and tiered onboarding, and enforces fine-grained, time-bounded access control across care graphs. Data are end-to-end encrypted both locally and during peer synchronization; documents can be captured or uploaded as PDFs. An integrated retrieval-augmented LLM produces structured, role-targeted summaries and action plans, offers evidence-grounded verification with provenance and confidence scores, and supports advanced insights on reports. We describe the architecture, connector abstractions, security primitives, and report robustness evaluations using synthetic ontology-driven data, as well as a feasibility study with a real-life care circle. We outline plans for longitudinal in-the-wild evaluation of access control correctness and credibility support.</description>

      <title>An Iconic Heavy Hitter Algorithm Made Private</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying heavy hitters in data streams is a fundamental problem with widespread applications in modern analytics systems. These streams are often derived from sensitive user activity, making update-level privacy guarantees necessary. While recent work has adapted the classical heavy hitter algorithm Misra-Gries to satisfy differential privacy in the streaming model, the privatization of other heavy hitter algorithms with better empirical utility is absent.
  Under this observation, we present the first differentially private variant of the SpaceSaving algorithm, which, in the non-private setting, is regarded as the state-of-the-art in practice. Our construction post-processes a non-private SpaceSaving summary by injecting asymptotically optimal noise and applying a carefully calibrated selection rule that suppresses unstable labels. This yields strong privacy guarantees while preserving the empirical advantages of SpaceSaving.
  Second, we introduce a generic method for extracting heavy hitters from any differentially private frequency oracle in the data stream model. The method requires only O(k) additional memory, where k is the number of heavy items, and provides a mechanism for safely releasing item identities from noisy frequency estimates. This yields an efficient, plug-and-play approach for private heavy hitter recovery from linear sketches.
  Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets. Across a wide range of privacy parameters and space budgets, our method provides superior utility to the existing differentially private Misra-Gries algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the empirical superiority of SpaceSaving survives privatization and that efficient, practical heavy hitter identification is achievable under strong differential privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>$PC^2$: Politically Controversial Content Generation via Jailbreaking Attacks on GPT-based Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled high-fidelity visual synthesis on a global scale. However, these advancements have introduced significant security risks, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. Politically harmful content, such as fabricated depictions of public figures, poses severe threats when weaponized for fake news or propaganda. Despite its criticality, the robustness of current T2I safety filters against such politically motivated adversarial prompting remains underexplored. In response, we propose $PC^2$, the first black-box political jailbreaking framework for T2I models. It exploits a novel vulnerability where safety filters evaluate political sensitivity based on linguistic context. $PC^2$ operates through: (1) Identity-Preserving Descriptive Mapping to obfuscate sensitive keywords into neutral descriptions, and (2) Geopolitically Distal Translation to map these descriptions into fragmented, low-sensitivity languages. This strategy prevents filters from constructing toxic relationships between political entities within prompts, effectively bypassing detection. We construct a benchmark of 240 politically sensitive prompts involving 36 public figures. Evaluation on commercial T2I models, specifically GPT-series, shows that while all original prompts are blocked, $PC^2$ achieves attack success rates of up to 86%.</description>

      <title>Principal ideal problem and ideal shortest vector over rational primes in power-of-two cyclotomic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shortest vector problem (SVP) over ideal lattices is closely related to the Ring-LWE problem, which is widely used to build post-quantum cryptosystems. Power-of-two cyclotomic fields are frequently adopted to instantiate Ring-LWE. Pan et al. (EUROCRYPT~2021) explored the SVP over ideal lattices via the decomposition fields and, in particular determined the length of the shortest vector in prime ideals lying over rational primes $p\equiv3,5\pmod{8}$ in power-of-two cyclotomic fields via explicit construction of reduced lattice bases.
  In this work, we first provide a new method (different from analyzing lattice bases) to analyze the length of the shortest vector in prime ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_{2^{n+1}}]$ when $p\equiv3,5\pmod{8}$. Then we precisely characterize the length of the shortest vector in the cases of $p\equiv7,9\pmod{16}$. Furthermore, we derive a new upper bound $\sqrt[4]{2^{2n+1}p}$ for this length, which is tighter than the bound $2^n\sqrt[4]{p}$ obtained from Minkowski's theorem. Our key technique is to investigate whether a generator of a principal ideal can achieve the shortest length after embedding as a vector. If this holds for the ideal, finding the shortest vector in this ideal can be reduced to finding its shortest generator.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning Fails to Remove Data Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of several practical methods for approximate machine unlearning developed for large-scale deep learning. In addition to complying with data deletion requests, one often-cited potential application for unlearning methods is to remove the effects of poisoned data. We experimentally demonstrate that, while existing unlearning methods have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of settings, they fail to remove the effects of data poisoning across a variety of types of poisoning attacks (indiscriminate, targeted, and a newly-introduced Gaussian poisoning attack) and models (image classifiers and LLMs); even when granted a relatively large compute budget. In order to precisely characterize unlearning efficacy, we introduce new evaluation metrics for unlearning based on data poisoning. Our results suggest that a broader perspective, including a wider variety of evaluations, are required to avoid a false sense of confidence in machine unlearning procedures for deep learning without provable guarantees. Moreover, while unlearning methods show some signs of being useful to efficiently remove poisoned data without having to retrain, our work suggests that these methods are not yet ``ready for prime time,'' and currently provide limited benefit over retraining.</description>

      <title>GreedyPixel: Fine-Grained Black-Box Adversarial Attack Via Greedy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs with small, carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification -- making adversarial attacks a critical tool for evaluating robustness. Existing black-box methods typically entail a trade-off between precision and flexibility: pixel-sparse attacks (e.g., single- or few-pixel attacks) provide fine-grained control but lack adaptability, whereas patch- or frequency-based attacks improve efficiency or transferability, but at the cost of producing larger and less precise perturbations. We present GreedyPixel, a fine-grained black-box attack method that performs brute-force-style, per-pixel greedy optimization guided by a surrogate-derived priority map and refined by means of query feedback. It evaluates each coordinate directly without any gradient information, guaranteeing monotonic loss reduction and convergence to a coordinate-wise optimum, while also yielding near white-box-level precision and pixel-wise sparsity and perceptual quality. On the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, spanning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer models, GreedyPixel achieved state-of-the-art success rates with visually imperceptible perturbations, effectively bridging the gap between black-box practicality and white-box performance. The implementation is available at https://github.com/azrealwang/greedypixel.</description>

      <title>An Improved Privacy and Utility Analysis of Differentially Private SGD with Bounded Domain and Smooth Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its privacy guarantee often comes at a large cost of model performance due to the lack of tight theoretical bounds quantifying privacy loss. While recent efforts have achieved more accurate privacy guarantees, they still impose some assumptions prohibited from practical applications, such as convexity and complex parameter requirements, and rarely investigate in-depth the impact of privacy mechanisms on the model's utility. In this paper, we provide a rigorous privacy characterization for DPSGD with general L-smooth and non-convex loss functions, revealing converged privacy loss with iteration in bounded-domain cases. Specifically, we track the privacy loss over multiple iterations, leveraging the noisy smooth-reduction property, and further establish comprehensive convergence analysis in different scenarios. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i) the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, (ii) a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously under certain conditions, and (iii) the attainable big-O order of the privacy utility trade-off for DPSGD with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC) and for DPSGD-GC with bounded domain (DPSGD-DC) and mu-strongly convex population risk function, respectively. Experiments via membership inference attack (MIA) in a practical setting validate insights gained from the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack</title>

Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy as a Perk: Federated Learning over Multiple-Access Fading Channels with a Multi-Antenna Base Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy} in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms, formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains, nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station (BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive numerical results.</description>

      <title>SiliconHealth: A Complete Low-Cost Blockchain Healthcare Infrastructure for Resource-Constrained Regions Using Repurposed Bitcoin Mining ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SiliconHealth, a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare infrastructure designed for resource-constrained regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. We demonstrate that obsolete Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) can be repurposed to create a secure, low-cost, and energy-efficient medical records system. The proposed architecture employs a four-tier hierarchical network: regional hospitals using Antminer S19 Pro (90+ TH/s), urban health centers with Antminer S9 (14 TH/s), rural clinics equipped with Lucky Miner LV06 (500 GH/s, 13W), and mobile health points with portable ASIC devices. We introduce the Deterministic Hardware Fingerprinting (DHF) paradigm, which repurposes SHA-256 mining ASICs as cryptographic proof generators, achieving 100% verification rate across 23 test proofs during 300-second validation sessions. The system incorporates Reed-Solomon LSB watermarking for medical image authentication with 30-40% damage tolerance, semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent medical record queries, and offline synchronization protocols for intermittent connectivity. Economic analysis demonstrates 96% cost reduction compared to GPU-based alternatives, with total deployment cost of $847 per rural clinic including 5-year solar power infrastructure. Validation experiments on Lucky Miner LV06 (BM1366 chip, 5nm) achieve 2.93 MH/W efficiency and confirm hardware universality. This work establishes a practical framework for deploying verifiable, tamper-proof electronic health records in regions where traditional healthcare IT infrastructure is economically unfeasible, potentially benefiting over 600 million people lacking access to basic health information systems.</description>
