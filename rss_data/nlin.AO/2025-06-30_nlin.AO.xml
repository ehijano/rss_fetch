      <title>Nonlocal-coupling-based control of coherence resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nonlocal coupling enables control of the collective stochastic dynamics in the regime of coherence resonance. The control scheme based on the nonlocal interaction properties is presented by means of numerical simulation on an example of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators. In particular, increasing the coupling radius is shown to enhance or to suppress the effect of coherence resonance which is reflected in the evolution of the dependence of the correlation time and the deviation of interspike intervals on the noise intensity. Nonlocal coupling is considered as an intermediate option between local and global coupling topologies which are also discussed in the context of the coherence resonance control.</description>

      <title>Finite size effect in Kuramoto oscillators with inertia on simplicial complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-size effects on the dynamical evolution of the Kuramoto model with inertia coupled through triadic interactions. Our findings reveal that fluctuations resulting from the finite size drive the system toward a synchronized state at finite coupling, which contrasts with the analytical predictions {in thermodynamic limit} made for the same system. Building on the analytical calculations performed at the thermodynamic limit, we identify the origin of the synchronization transition that arises because of the finite size. We discover a power-law relationship between the network size and the critical coupling at which the first-order transition to synchronization occurs. Additionally, as inertia increases, there is a significant shift in the critical coupling toward higher values, indicating that inertia counteracts the effects caused by finite size.</description>

      <title>Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</description>

      <title>Bayesian estimation of coupling strength and heterogeneity in a coupled oscillator model from macroscopic quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various macroscopic oscillations, such as the heartbeat and the flashing of fireflies, are created by synchronizing oscillatory units (oscillators). To elucidate the mechanism of synchronization, several coupled oscillator models have been devised and extensively analyzed. Although parameter estimation of these models has also been actively investigated, most of the proposed methods are based on the data from individual oscillators, not from macroscopic quantities. In the present study, we propose a Bayesian framework to estimate the model parameters of coupled oscillator models, using the time series data of the Kuramoto order parameter as the only given data. We adopt the exchange Monte Carlo method for the efficient estimation of the posterior distribution and marginal likelihood. Numerical experiments are performed to confirm the validity of our method and examine the dependence of the estimation error on the observational noise and system size.</description>

      <title>A Physical and Mathematical Framework for the Semantic Theory of Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Semantic Theory of Evolution (STE) takes the existence of a number of arbitrary communication codes as a fundamental feature of life, from the genetic code to human cultural communication codes. Their arbitrariness enables, at each level, the selection of one out of several possible correspondences along with the generation of meaning. STE enables more novelties to emerge and suggests a greater variety of potential life forms.
  With this paper I ground STE on physical theories of meaningful information. Furthermore, I show that key features of the arbitrary communication codes employed by living organisms can be expressed by means of Evidence Theory (ET).
  In particular, I adapt ET to organisms that merely react to sequences of stimuli, explain its basics for organisms that are capable of prediction, and illustrate an unconventional version suitable for the most intricate communication codes employed by humans. Finally, I express the natural trend towards ambiguity reduction in terms of information entropy minimization along with thermodynamic entropy maximization.</description>

      <title>Active Matter Flocking via Predictive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding collective self-organization in active matter, such as bird flocks and fish schools, remains a grand challenge in physics. Interactions that induce alignment are essential for flocking; however, alignment alone is generally insufficient to maintain group cohesion in the presence of noise, leading traditional models to introduce artificial boundaries or explicit attractive forces. Here, we propose a model that achieves cohesive flocking through purely alignment-based interactions by introducing predictive alignment, in which agents reorient to maximize alignment with the prevailing orientations of their anticipated future neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time Vicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion without additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly with interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed, and the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal how predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new class of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics.</description>

      <title>Duplication-divergence growing graph models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>
