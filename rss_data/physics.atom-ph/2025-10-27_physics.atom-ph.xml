      <title>Efficient Water-Cooled Bitter-Type Electromagnet for Zeeman Slowing in Cold-Atom Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the design, construction, and characterization of a Bitter-type electromagnet that produces a spatially-dependent magnetic field used for Zeeman slowing in cold-atom experiments. The coil consists of stacked copper arcs separated by PTFE spacers of varying thicknesses, generating a near-optimal field profile using a single power supply. With an electrical resistance of $26.5(3)$~m$\Omega$ and self-inductance of $19.1(1)$~$\mu$H, our design achieves a fast electrical switching time of $\tau \approx 180$~$\mu$s in a compact, 30-cm-long package. Water circulating helically through holes in the copper and channels in the spacers ensures efficient thermal management, limiting the temperature rise to $\sim 5^\circ$~C over $36$~s of continuous operation at $200$~A.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical trapping of Zinc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of atomic zinc. The atoms are cooled using the 213.9\,nm $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^1$P$_1$ transition, making this the shortest wavelength employed for magneto-optical trapping thus far. We demonstrate trapping of all stable isotopes of zinc, including the fermionic isotope $^{67}$Zn, which features a very narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_0$ transition that could form the basis of an optical atomic clock. We characterize the influence of various parameters on the MOT population and loading rate. The results presented here constitute the first step towards the application of zinc for high-precision optical spectroscopy and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Observation of spin singlet butterfly Rydberg molecules in an ultracold atomic Rb gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of spin-singlet ultra-long range Rydberg butterfly molecules consisting of a ground-state atom bound to a Rydberg atom by $P$-wave scattering of $^{87}$Rb Rydberg electrons from $^{87}$Rb(5s) atoms. A three-photon excitation scheme enables the photoassociation of these molecules by weakly admixing Rb($18f_{7/2}$) states. The measured binding energies, kilo-Debye permanent electric dipole moments, and lifetimes are in excellent agreement with theory. Two long-lived vibrational levels, red detuned from the Rb($18f_{7/2}$) threshold, are observed. This experiment is a foundational step in the production of ultra-cold anions and heavy Rydberg ion-pair systems.</description>

      <title>RydIQule Version 2: Enhancing graph-based modeling of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic radio-frequency (rf) sensors are an emerging technology platform that relies on vaporous atoms, interrogated with laser beams and nearly ionized, to receive rf signals. Rydberg rf sensors have a number of interesting fundamental distinctions from traditional receiver technologies, such as those based on metallic antennas, since they are governed by the quantum physics of atom-light interactions. As Rydberg sensors quickly advance from laboratory experiments into fieldable devices, there is a need for a general software modeling tool that fully encompasses the internal physics of the sensor. The Rydberg Interactive Quantum Module (RydIQule) is a Python package designed to fill this need. The initial public release of RydIQule in late 2023 built the core functionality described above. Here we outline RydIQule's version 2 release which expands on its capabilities to more accurately model real-world atoms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</description>

      <title>Can Bose-Einstein condensates enhance radioactive decay?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation. Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that this is not the case, and the proposed experiments would have a gain of only $10^{-20}$ or smaller. We also analyze proposals for gamma ray lasers based on stimulated annihilation of positronium Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Fundamental impossibility of a superradiant neutrino laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we address the fundamental question whether an idealized system of $N$ atoms will show collective behavior and superradiance when it emits fermions instead of photons. We show that the maximum emission is $\propto N$ and not $\propto N^2$ which proves the absence of superradiance and shows that the recent proposal to realize a superradiant neutrino laser is impossible. This can be understood as either destructive interference of fermionic transition amplitudes, or Pauli blockade by collective excitations with fermionic nature. On the other hand, states with low excitation can show collective behavior. We derive the exact solution of the fermionic Dicke problem and analyze the decay dynamics in various regimes.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Rydberg states of helium: Results for $2 \le n \le 35$ and comparison with experiment for the singlet and triplet $P$-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High precision variational calculations in Hylleraas coordinates are presented for all singlet and triplet $P$-states of helium up to principal quantum number $n = 35$ with a uniform accuracy of 1 part in $10^{22}$ for the nonrelativistic energy. Mass polarization, relativistic and quantum electrodynamic effects are included to achieve a final accuracy of $\pm$1 kHz or better for the ionization energy of the Rydberg states of $^4$He in the range $24\le n \le 35$. The results are combined with 11 transition frequency measurements of Clausen et al. Phys. Rev. A 111, 012817 (2025) to obtain complementary measurements of the ionization energy of the $1s2s\;^3S_1$ state that do not depend on quantum defect extrapolations to the series limit. The result from the triplet spectrum yields an ionization energy of 1152 842 742.728(6) MHz, which agrees with but is larger than the experimental value by 14 $\pm$17 kHz. However, it confirms a much larger 9$\sigma$ discrepancy of $0.468\pm0.055$ MHz with the theoretical ionization energy of Patk\'o\v{s} et al. Phys. Rev. A 103, 042809 (2021). The results provide a test of the quantum defect extrapolation method at the level of $\pm$17 kHz. This revised version contains an additional table of spin-dependent matrix elements of the Breit interaction in the appendix for $24\le n\le 35$. (12 pages, 1 figure).</description>

      <title>Observation of the distribution of nuclear magnetization in a molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in the experimental control and interrogation of molecules, combined with developments in precise calculations of their structure, are enabling new opportunities in the investigation of nuclear and particle physics phenomena. Molecules containing heavy, octupole-deformed nuclei such as radium are of particular interest for such studies, offering an enhanced sensitivity to the properties of fundamental particles and interactions. Here, we report precision laser spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations of the structure of the radioactive radium monofluoride molecule, $^{225}$Ra$^{19}$F. Our results allow fine details of the short-range electron-nucleus interaction to be revealed, indicating the high sensitivity of this molecule to the distribution of magnetization, currently a poorly constrained nuclear property, within the radium nucleus. These results provide a direct and stringent test of the description of the electronic wavefunction inside the nuclear volume, highlighting the suitability of these molecules to investigate subatomic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Determining Absolute Neutrino Mass using Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino mass require high-precision measurements of $\beta$-decay electron energies close to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high phase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the implementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow extended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately measure the kinetic energies of individual $\beta$-decay electrons generated in these dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron radiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy technique can benefit from recent developments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and electrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron kinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can be performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states. Quantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency measurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal observation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies in these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies for Neutrino Mass project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental apparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a sensitivity on the order of 10~meV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</description>
