      <title>Ring Elements of Stable Range One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ring element $\,a\in R\,$ is said to be of {\it right stable range one\/} if, for any $\,t\in R$, $\,aR+tR=R\,$ implies that $\,a+t\,b\,$ is a unit in $\,R\,$ for some $\,b\in R$. Similarly, $\,a\in R\,$ is said to be of {\it left stable range one\/} if $\,R\,a+R\,t=R\,$ implies that $\,a+b't\,$ is a unit in $\,R\,$ for some $\,b'\in R$. In the last two decades, it has often been speculated that these two notions are actually the same for any $\,a\in R$. In \S3 of this paper, we will prove that this is indeed the case. The key to the proof of this new symmetry result is a certain ``Super Jacobson's Lemma'', which generalizes Jacobson's classical lemma stating that, for any $\,a,b\in R$, $\,1-ab\,$ is a unit in $\,R\,$ iff so is $\,1-ba$. Our proof for the symmetry result above has led to a new generalization of a classical determinantal identity of Sylvester, which will be published separately in [KL$_3$]. In \S\S4-5, a detailed study is offered for stable range one ring elements that are unit-regular or nilpotent, while \S6 examines the behavior of stable range one elements via their classical Peirce decompositions. The paper ends with a more concrete \S7 on integral matrices of stable range one, followed by a final \S8 with a few open questions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras and pre-Novikov bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-Novikov algebras and quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras naturally appear in the theory of Novikov bialgebras. In this paper, we show that there is a natural pre-Novikov algebra structure associated to a quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebra. Then we introduce the definition of double constructions of quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras associated to two pre-Novikov algebras and show that it is characterized by a pre-Novikov bialgebra. We also introduce the notion of pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation, whose symmetric solutions can produce pre-Novikov bialgebras. Moreover, the operator forms of pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation are also investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article will discussing on $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations of quasi-filiform Lie algebras of maximum length. The non-trivial transposed Poisson algebras with the quasi-filiform Lie algebras of maximum length are constructed by using $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations of Lie algebras. We have established commutative associative multiplication to construct a transposed Poisson algebra with an associated given Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Translational hulls of semigroups of endomorphisms of an algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the translational hull $\Omega(I)$ of an arbitrary subsemigroup $I$ of an endomorphism monoid $\mathrm{End}(A)$ where $A$ is a universal algebra. We give conditions for every bi-translation of $I$ to be realised by transformations, or by endomorphisms, of $A$. We demonstrate that certain of these conditions are also sufficient to provide natural isomorphisms between the translational hull of $I$ and the idealiser of $I$ within $\mathrm{End}(A)$, which in the case where $I$ is an ideal is simply $\mathrm{End}(A)$. We describe the connection between these conditions and work of Petrich and Gluskin in the context of densely embedded ideals. Where the conditions fail, we develop a methodology to extract information concerning $\Omega(I)$ from the translational hull $\Omega(I/{\approx})$ of a quotient $I/{\approx}$ of $I$. We illustrate these concepts in detail in the cases where $A$ is: a free algebra; an independence algebra; a finite symmetric group.</description>

      <title>The coproduct for the affine Yangian and the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

      <title>Broken lines and compatible pairs for rank 2 quantum cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been several combinatorial constructions of universally positive bases in cluster algebras, and these same combinatorial objects play a crucial role in the known proofs of the famous positivity conjecture for cluster algebras. The greedy basis was constructed in rank $2$ by Lee-Li-Zelevinsky using compatible pairs on Dyck paths. The theta basis, introduced by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, has elements expressed as a sum over broken lines on scattering diagrams. It was shown by Cheung-Gross-Muller-Musiker-Rupel-Stella-Williams that these bases coincide in rank $2$ via algebraic methods, and they posed the open problem of giving a combinatorial proof by constructing a (weighted) bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines.
  We construct a quantum-weighted bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines for the quantum type $A_2$ and the quantum Kronecker cluster algebras. By specializing the quantum parameter, this handles the problem of Cheung et al. for skew-symmetric cluster algebras of finite and affine type. For cluster monomials in skew-symmetric rank-$2$ cluster algebras, we construct a quantum-weighted bijection between positive compatible pairs (which comprise almost all compatible pairs) and broken lines of negative angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Associativity and Commutativity of Partially Ordered Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a commutative monoid $(M,+,0)$ and a biadditive binary operation $\mu \colon {M} \times {M} \to M$. We will show that under some additional general assumptions, the operation $\mu$ is automatically associative and commutative. The main additional assumption is localizability of $\mu$, which essentially means that a certain canonical order on $M$ is compatible with adjoining some multiplicative inverses of elements of $M$. As an application we show that a division ring $\mathbb{F}$ is commutative provided that for all $a \in \mathbb{F}$ there exists a natural number $k$ such that $a-k$ is not a sum of products of squares. This generalizes the classical theorem that every archimedean ordered division ring is commutative to a more general class of formally real division rings that do not necessarily allow for an archimedean (total) order. Similar results about automatic associativity and commutativity are well-known for special types of partially ordered rings, namely in the uniformly bounded and the lattice-ordered cases, i.e.~for $f$-algebras. In these cases the commutative monoid in question is the positive cone of the ordered ring. We also discuss how these classical results can be obtained from the main theorem.</description>

      <title>On polynomial completeness properties of finite Mal'cev algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial completeness results aim at characterizing those functions that are induced by polynomials. Each polynomial function is congruence preserving, but the opposite need not be true. A finite algebraic structure $\mathbf{A}$ is called strictly 1-affine complete if every unary partial function from a subset of $A$ to $A$ that preserves the congruences of $\mathbf{A}$ can be interpolated by a polynomial function of $\mathbf{A}$. The problem of characterizing strictly 1-affine complete finite Mal'cev algebras is still open. In this paper we extend the characterization by E. Aichinger and P. Idziak of strictly 1-affine complete expanded groups to finite congruence regular Mal'cev algebras.</description>

Abstract: We study path rings, Cohn path rings, and Leavitt path rings associated to directed graphs, with coefficients in an arbitrary ring $R$. For each of these types of rings, we stipulate conditions on the graph that are necessary and sufficient to ensure that the ring satisfies either the rank condition or the strong rank condition whenever $R$ enjoys the same property. In addition, we apply our result for path rings and the strong rank condition to characterize the graphs that give rise to amenable path algebras and exhaustively amenable path algebras.</description>

      <title>The product of simple modules over KLR algebras and quiver Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.08244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the product of two simple modules over KLR algebras using the quiver Grassmannians for Dynkin quivers. More precisely, we establish a bridge between the Induction functor on the category of modules of KLR algebras and the irreducible components of quiver Grassmannians for Dynkin quivers via a sort of extension varieties, which is an analogue of the extension group in Hall algebras. As a result, we give a necessary condition when the product of two simple modules over a KLR algebra is simple using the set of irreducible components of quiver Grassmannians. In particular, in some special cases, we provide a proof for the conjecture recently proposed by Lapid and Minguez.</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories of locally presentable abelian DG-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of an abelian DG-category, introduced by the first-named author in arXiv:2110.08237, unites the notions of abelian categories and (curved) DG-modules in a common framework. In this paper we consider coderived and contraderived categories in the sense of Becker. Generalizing some constructions and results from the preceding papers by Becker arXiv:1205.4473 and by the present authors arXiv:2101.10797, we define the contraderived category of a locally presentable abelian DG-category $\mathbf B$ with enough projective objects and the coderived category of a Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$. We construct the related abelian model category structures and show that the resulting exotic derived categories are well-generated. Then we specialize to the case of a locally coherent Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$, and prove that its coderived category is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of finitely presentable objects of $\mathbf A$, thus generalizing a result from the second-named author's preprint arXiv:1412.1615. In particular, the homotopy category of graded-injective left DG-modules over a DG-ring with a left coherent underlying graded ring is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of DG-modules with finitely presentable underlying graded modules. We also describe compact generators of the coderived categories of quasi-coherent matrix factorizations over coherent schemes.</description>

      <title>Semisimple elements and the little Weyl group of real semisimple $Z_m$-graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the semisimple orbits of a Vinberg $\theta$-representation. First we take the complex numbers as base field. By a case by case analysis we show a technical result stating the equality of two sets of hyperplanes, one corresponding to the restricted roots of a Cartan subspace, the other corresponding to the complex reflections in the (little) Weyl group. The semisimple orbits have representatives in a finite number of sets that correspond to reflection subgroups of the (little) Weyl group. One of the consequences of our technical result is that the elements in a fixed such set all have the same stabilizer in the acting group. Secondly we study what happens when the base field is the real numbers. We look at Cartan subspaces and show that the real Cartan subspaces can be classified by the first Galois cohomology set of the normalizer of a fixed real Cartan subspace. In the real case the orbits can be classified using Galois cohomology. However, in order for that to work we need to know which orbits have a real representative. We show a theorem that characterizes the orbits of homogeneous semisimple elements that do have such a real representative. This closely follows and generalizes a theorem from \cite{bgl}.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional genetic and evolution algebras generated by Gibbs measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genetic and evolution algebras arise naturally from applied probability and stochastic processes. Gibbs measures describe interacting systems commonly studied in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics with applications in several fields. Here, we consider that the algebras are determined by configurations of finite spins on a countable set with their associated Gibbs distributions. The model preserves properties of the finite-dimensional Gibbs algebras found in the literature and extend their results. We introduce infertility in the genetic dynamics when the configurations differ macroscopically. It induces a decomposition of the algebra into a direct sum of fertile ideals with genetic realization.
  The proposed infinite-dimensional algebras are commutative, non-associative, with uncountable basis and zero divisors. The properties of Gibbs measures allow us to deal with the difficulties arising from the algebraic structure and obtain the results presented in this article.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Finite $\mathbb{Z}$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02610v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $R$, i.e., for a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra which is a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module, we assume that $R$ is explicitly given by a system of $\mathbb{Z}$-module generators $G$, its relation module ${\rm Syz}(G)$, and the structure constants of the multiplication in $R$. In this setting we develop and analyze efficient algorithms for computing essential information about $R$. First we provide polynomial time algorithms for solving linear systems of equations over $R$ and for basic ideal-theoretic operations in $R$. Then we develop ZPP (zero-error probabilitic polynomial time) algorithms to compute the nilradical and the maximal ideals of 0-dimensional affine algebras $K[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I$ with $K=\mathbb{Q}$ or $K=\mathbb{F}_p$. The task of finding the associated primes of a finite $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra $R$ is reduced to these cases and solved in ZPPIF (ZPP plus one integer factorization). With the same complexity, we calculate the connected components of the set of minimal associated primes ${\rm minPrimes}(R)$ and then the primitive idempotents of $R$. Finally, we prove that knowing an explicit representation of $R$ is polynomial time equivalent to knowing a strong Gr\"obner basis of an ideal $I$ such that $R = \mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n]/I$.</description>
