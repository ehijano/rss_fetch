      <title>Complex structures on two-step nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the $2$-step nilpotent Lie algebras whose corresponding Lie groups admit a left invariant complex structure. This is done by considering separately the cases when the complex structure is 2-step or 3-step nilpotent in the sense of [Cordero-Fern\'andez-Gray-Ugarte, 2000]. We also study the Hermitian geometry 2-step nilpotent Lie groups. We show that if a left invariant Hermitian metric on such Lie group is pluriclosed, then the corresponding complex structure is 2-step nilpotent. Moreover, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such a metric to be pluriclosed in case the complex structure is abelian. This allows us to show that pluriclosed metrics on nilpotent Lie algebras with one dimensional commutator ideal can only occur on trivial central extensions of the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.
  We show that certain Hermitian nilmanifolds constructed from compact semisimple irreducible Hermitian symmetric pairs are pluriclosed with respect to a canonically defined abelian complex structure.
  Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a naturally reductive Riemannian metric on a nilmanifold to be Hermitian with respect to an abelian complex structure. We prove the analogue of this result in the hypercomplex case, thereby obtaining a distinguished family of hyper-K\"ahler with torsion metrics.</description>

  As an application, we prove that every Riemannian 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains, for every g, a genus g embedded minimal surface with area at most twice the first Simon-Smith width of the ambient 3-sphere.</description>

      <title>An index formula for families of end-periodic Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a transgression formula for the renormalized Chern character of the Bismut superconnection in the context of end-periodic fiber bundles and families of end-periodic Clifford modules. The transgression is expressed in terms of the Fourier-Laplace transform of the Bismut superconnection using the renormalized supertrace of Mrowka-Ruberman-Saveliev. Consequently, we establish an index formula for families of Dirac operators on end-periodic manifolds. The index formula involves a new ``end-periodic eta form'' which generalizes both the Bismut-Cheeger eta form and the end-periodic eta invariant of Mrowka-Ruberman-Saveliev.</description>

      <title>The First Eigenvalue of Embedded Minimal Hypersurfaces in the Unit Sphere I: Yau's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by meticulously constructing a minimizing sequence within a suitable Sobolev space and leveraging the variational principle, we establish that the first non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on an embedded minimal hypersurface in the unit sphere equals the dimension of the hypersurface. This result furnishes an affirmative resolution to a renowned conjecture posed by Yau, which had remained unresolved for an extended period. As some important applications, several rigidity theorems are established via eigenvalue characterization.</description>

      <title>Transversality Methods for Homotopy Groups of Stable Loci in Affine GIT Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the homotopy groups of stable loci in affine Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT), arising from linear actions of complex reductive algebraic groups on complex affine spaces. Our approach extends the infinite-dimensional transversality framework of Daskalopoulos-Uhlenbeck and Wilkin to this general GIT setting. Central to our method is the construction of a G-equivariant holomorphic vector bundle over the conjugation orbit of a one-parameter subgroup (1-PS), whose fibres are precisely the negative weight spaces determining instability. A key proposition establishes that a naturally defined evaluation map is transverse to the zero section of this bundle, implying that generic homotopies avoid all unstable and strictly semistable strata under certain dimensional inequalities.
  Our result also covers cases where semistability does not coincide with stability. The applicability of this framework is illustrated by several examples. For the 2-Kronecker quiver, our conclusions precisely match the known topology of the stable locus. In linear control theory, where GIT stability corresponds to the notion of controllability, our results determine the connectivity of the space of controllable systems. In statistical modelling, where stability for star-shaped Gaussian model corresponds to the existence of a unique Maximum Likelihood Estimate, we compute the connectivity of the space of data samples that yield such a unique estimate, providing topological insight into the problem of parameter non-identifiability.</description>

      <title>Geometry of supergravity and the Batalin--Vilkovisky formulation of the $\mathcal N=1$ theory in ten dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide full details of a BV formulation of $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions, to all orders in fermions, built from the generalised geometry description of the theory. In contrast to standard treatments, we introduce neither the degrees of freedom corresponding to orthonormal frames for the metric nor the local Lorentz symmetries that remove them again. Instead, we observe that the field space has a fibred structure, with the fermionic degrees of freedom spanning the fibres. We explain in detail how this geometric picture allows one to understand simultaneous variations of spinorial quantities and the metric with respect to which the spinor bundles are defined. This leads to additional terms in certain commutators on field space which account for the Lorentz transformation terms appearing in the calculation of the supersymmetry algebra. Unencumbered by the Lorentz degrees of freedom, we provide an efficient and full demonstration that our action satisfies the classical master equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial description of the embedded contact homology chain complex of the unit cotangent bundle of the Klein bottle with the standard flat Riemannian metric. Using pseudoholomorphic curves coming from the associated differential, we find an obstruction theorem for symplectic embeddings of toric domains $X_\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ into the unit disk cotangent bundle $D^*K$. As an application we compute the Gromov width of $D^*K$.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality, and a curvature-driven pre-compactness result. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Transverse expansion of the metric at null hypersurfaces II. Existence results and application to Killing horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper finishes the series of two papers that we started with [arXiv:2405.05377], where we analyzed the transverse expansion of the metric at a general null hypersurface. While [arXiv:2405.05377] focused on uniqueness results, here we show existence of ambient manifolds given the full asymptotic expansion at the null hypersurface. When such expansion fulfills a set of "constraint equations" we prove that the ambient manifold solves the Einstein equations to infinite order at the hypersurface. Our approach does not make any assumptions regarding the dimension or topology of the null hypersurface and is entirely covariant. Furthermore, when the hypersurface exhibits a product topology we find the minimum amount of data on a cross-section that ensures the existence of an ambient space solving the Einstein equations to infinite order on the hypersurface. As an application we recall the notion of abstract Killing horizon data (AKH) introduced in [arXiv:2405.05377], namely the minimal data needed to define a non-degenerate Killing horizon from a detached viewpoint, and we prove that every AKH of arbitrary dimension and topology gives rise to an ambient space solving the {\Lambda}-vacuum equations to infinite order and with the given data as Killing horizon. Our result also includes the possibility of the Killing vector having zeroes at the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space: Existence and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the seminal work [27], Rivin obtained a complete characterization of finite ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space by the exterior dihedral angles. Since then,the characterization of infinite hyperbolic polyhedra has become an extremely challenging open problem. By studying ideal circle patterns (ICPs), we characterize the infinite ideal polyhedra (IIP) and resolve this problem. Specifically, we establish the existence and rigidity of embedded ICPs on the plane. We further prove the uniformization theorem for the embedded ICPs, which solves the type problem of infinite ICPs. This is an analog of the uniformization theorem obtained by He and Schramm in [22, 23]. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs depends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the selection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show the difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with prescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem of infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary angles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and ICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings, VEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our setting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we develop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for ICPs.</description>
