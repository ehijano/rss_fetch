      <title>Some examples of use of transfinite induction in analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is not uncommon in analysis that existence of extremal objects is obtained via an iterative procedure: we start from a given admissible object, then modify it, then modify again etc... If being extremal means maximimizing a real valued quantity and we are sure to approach the supremum fast enough, after a countable number of steps and a limiting procedure we are done.
  In this short note we want to advertise a slightly different line of thought, where rather than trying to approach the supremum fast enough, we: try to increase, if possible, the function to be maximized and, at the same time, index our recursive procedure over ordinals. Since there are no increasing functions from $\omega_1$ to $\R$, the procedure must stop at some countable ordinal and existence is proved anyway.
  The advantage of this line of reasoning is that it can be helpful even in situations where it is not so evident how to measure `being maximal' via a real valued function. This is the case, for instance, for existence of a Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development of an initial data set in General Relativity.
  Speaking of this particular example, we also show that such `real-valued quantification' of the size of a development is actually possible, thus existence of a maximal one can be obtained in a countable number of steps using the original argument in [2] together with the standard procedure depicted above. This provides a way alternative to the one given in [5] to `dezornify' the proof in [2].</description>

      <title>Prescribing the mean curvature of an achronal hypersurface as a measure: the case of 3D spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence problem for achronal hypersurfaces $M \hookrightarrow \overline{M}$ in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, whose mean curvature is a prescribed -- possibly singular -- source, and whose boundary is a given smooth spacelike submanifold. Since $M$ is allowed to go null somewhere, the mean curvature prescription is to be understood in the distributional sense. We prove a general existence and regularity theorem for surfaces in ambient dimension $3$. Although most of our estimates hold in any dimension, recent counterexamples show that some of our conclusions fail in ambient dimension at least $5$. The case of $4$D-spacetimes is an open problem. Our theorems have application to Born-Infeld electrostatics in general static spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Almost Ricci Bourguignon Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the study of almost Ricci-Bourguignon solitons by clarifying their position in the broader context of Einstein-type metrics. Motivated by known rigidity results for compact almost Ricci solitons, we aim to identify conditions under which a compact almost RB-soliton is trivial or exhibits special geometric properties. We compare our results with classical theorems of Barros and Ribeiro, and explain explicitly how our work extends or complements these earlier findings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove some rigidity and classification results for graphs with prescribed mean curvature and locally constant Dirichlet and Neumann data, for instance as they appear in capillarity problems. We consider domains in Riemannian manifolds, with emphasis on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. We classify both the underlying domain and the resulting solution, providing general splitting theorems in this setting.</description>

      <title>Conformal invariants for the zero mode equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-trivial solutions to the zero mode equation on a closed spin manifold \[D \varphi=iA\cdot \varphi,\] we first provide a simple proof for the sharp inequality \eq{ \norm{A}_{L^n}^2 \ge \frac {n}{4(n-1)} Y(M,[g]), } where $Y(M,[g])$ is the Yamabe constant of $(M,g)$, which was obtained by Frank-Loss and Reuss. Then we classify completely the equality case by proving that equality holds if and only if $\varphi$ is a Killing spinor, and if and only if $(M,g)$ is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold with $A$ (up to scaling) as its Reeb field and $\varphi$ a vacuum up to a conformal transformation. More generalizations have been also studied.</description>

Abstract: We show that for every $n \geq 2$ and $D &gt; 0$ there exist a convex domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb H^n$ with diameter $D$ and a convex potential $V$ on $\Omega$ such that the fundamental gap of the operator $-\Delta+V$ is strictly smaller than the fundamental gap of $-\Delta$. In comparison to previous work, this result requires more refined control of the eigenfunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity of isotropic harmonic maps from a 2-torus to a complex projective space, when they are constructed from holomorphic embeddings associated to complete linear systems. We also prove that this rigidity holds for any holomorphic embeddings without special hyperosculation points, with an extra assumption on the pullbacks of Fubini--Study symplectic forms. These results ensure the rigidity of towers of harmonic bands in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Variational Dissipative Mechanics on Lie Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a Herglotz-type variational principle on a Lie algebroid and derive the corresponding Euler--Lagrange--Herglotz equations for a Lagrangian depending on an additional scalar variable $z$. This provides a geometric framework for dissipative systems on Lie algebroids and recovers, as special cases, the classical Euler--Lagrange--Herglotz equations on tangent bundles, the Euler--Poincar\'e--Herglotz equations on a Lie algebra, and the Lagrange--Poincar\'e--Herglotz equations on Atiyah algebroids of principal bundles. Starting from the local formulation, we then use Lie algebroid connections to obtain a coordinate-free Euler--Lagrange--Poincar\'e--Herglotz and Hamilton--Pontryagin--Herglotz theory. Finally, we establish energy balance laws and Noether--Herglotz-type results, in which classical conserved quantities are replaced by dissipated invariants.</description>

      <title>On the subcritical Lane-Emden equation on Riemannian models with polynomial volume growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on the problems of existence and non-existence of positive solutions for the Sobolev-subcritical Lane-Emden equation on certain Riemannian manifolds (mainly models) with asymptotically negative curvature, which, from the viewpoint of the volume growth of geodesic balls, can be regarded as intermediate settings between the Euclidean and the hyperbolic spaces.
  A number of interesting phenomena arise: the subcritical regime naturally divides into three further ranges, characterized by existence phenomena (slightly subcritical), non-existence phenomena (strongly subcritical), and by a mixed behavior where existence and non-existence strongly depend on additional assumptions on the manifold (intermediate). In the intermediate regime, we further show that the radial homogeneous Dirichlet problem in geodesics balls may admit multiple positive solutions, thereby revealing substantial differences with respect to both the Euclidean and the hyperbolic settings.</description>

      <title>St\"ackel problem for non-diagonal Killing tensors: Yano-Patterson lifts, algebra of strong symmetries and quadratic in momenta integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct integrable Hamiltonian systems such that functionally independent Poisson commuting integrals are quadratic in the momenta. Unlike the classical St\"ackel setting, we allow the associated self-adjoint $(1,1)$-tensors $K_\alpha$ to be non-diagonalisable and have Jordan blocks and points where the Segre characteristic changes. Our construction is covariant and is based on Nijenhuis geometry: starting from a gl-regular Nijenhuis operator $L$ and its symmetry algebra, we obtain a large class of such integrable systems in a coordinate-free and signature-independent way; it is explicit once we have chosen a gl-regular Nijnhuis operator. In the diagonalisable case, our construction reproduces the St\"ackel construction, and in dimension $n=2$ it recovers all known systems of this type; for $n\ge 3$ most of our systems are new. Finally, we establish applications to infinite-dimensional integrable systems of hydrodynamic type: namely, we show that for Killing $(1,1)$-tensors $ K_\alpha$ corresponding to our example the evolutionarly PDE system of hydrodynamic type $u_t = K_\alpha(u)u_x$ is integrable. We describe its symmetries, and use generalised reciprocal transformations to reduce it to a system with constant coefficient matrices.</description>

      <title>Relative arbitrage problem under eigenvalue lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new formulation of the relative arbitrage problem from stochastic portfolio theory that asks for a time horizon beyond which arbitrage relative to the market exists in all ``sufficiently volatile'' markets. In our formulation, ``sufficiently volatile'' is interpreted as a lower bound on an ordered eigenvalue of the instantaneous covariation matrix, a quantity that has been studied extensively in the empirical finance literature. Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow. Beyond the setting of stochastic portfolio theory, the stochastic optimal control problem is analyzed for arbitrary compact, possibly non-convex, domains, thanks to a boundedness assumption on the instantaneous covariation matrix.</description>

      <title>A note on Poincar\'e-Sobolev type inequalities on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Poincar\'e-Sobolev type inequality on compact Riemannian manifolds where the deviation of a function from a biased average, defined using a density, is controlled by the unweighted Lebesgue norm of its gradient. Unlike classical weighted Poincar\'e inequalities, the density does not enter the measure or the Sobolev norms, but only the reference average. We show that the associated Poincar\'e constant depends quantitatively on the Lebesgue norm of the density. This framework naturally arises in the analysis of coupled elliptic systems and seems not to have been addressed in the existing literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalies of a quantum field theory (QFT) constitute fundamental non-perturbatively robust data. In this paper we extract anomalies of 5D superconformal field theories (SCFTs) directly from the underlying extra-dimensional geometry. We show that all of this information can be efficiently extracted from extra-dimensional $\eta$-invariants, bypassing previously established approaches based on computationally cumbersome blowup / resolution techniques. We illustrate these considerations for 5D SCFTs engineered in M-theory by non-compact geometries $X=\mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ with finite subgroup $\Gamma\subset SU(3)$, where the anomalies are determined by the $\eta$-invariants of the asymptotic boundary $\partial X=S^5/\Gamma$. Our results apply equally to Abelian and non-Abelian $\Gamma$, as well as isolated and non-isolated singularities. In the setting of non-isolated singularities we further analyze the interplay of anomaly structures across different strata of the singular locus. Our considerations extend readily to backgrounds which are not global orbifolds, as well as those which do not preserve supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Weyls's law for Compact Rank One Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyls law is a fundamental result governing the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues of teh Laplacian. It states that for a compact d dimensional manifold M (without boundary), the eigenvalue counting function has an asymptotic growth, whose leading term is of the order of d and the error term is no worse than order d-1.
  A natural question is: when is the error term sharp and when can it be improved? It has been known for a long time that the error term is sharp for the round sphere (since 1968). In contrast, it has only recently been shown (in 2019) by Iosevich and Wyman that for the product of spheres, the error term can be polynomially improved. They conjecture that a polynomial improvement should be true for products in general. In this paper we extend both these results to Compact Rank One Symmetric Spaces (CROSSes). We show that for CROSSes, the error term is sharp. Furthermore, we show that for a product of CROSSes, the error term can be polynomially improved. This gives further evidence to the conjecture made by Iosevich and Wyman.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Limit and Deformations of Complex Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.04087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on our recent adaptation of the adiabatic limit construction to the case of complex structures, we prove the fact that the deformation limiting manifold of any holomorphic family of Moishezon manifolds is Moishezon. Two new ingredients, hopefully of independent interest, are introduced. The first one associates with every compact complex manifold $X$, in every degree $k$, a holomorphic vector bundle over $\C$ of rank equal to the $k$-th Betti number of $X$. This vector bundle, previously given an algebraic construction in the literature, shows that the degenerating page of the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence of $X$ is the holomorphic limit, as $h\in\C^\star$ tends to $0$, of the $d_h$-cohomology of $X$, where $d_h=h\partial + \bar\partial$. A relative version of this vector bundle is then associated with every holomorphic family of compact complex manifolds. The second ingredient is a relaxation of the notion of strongly Gauduchon (sG) metric that we introduced in 2009. For a given positive integer $r$, a Gauduchon metric $\gamma$ on an $n$-dimensional compact complex manifold $X$ is said to be $E_r$-sG if $\partial\gamma^{n-1}$ represents the zero cohomology class on the $r$-th page of the Fr\"olicher spectral sequence of $X$. Strongly Gauduchon metrics coincide with $E_1$-sG metrics.</description>

      <title>Almost sharp local Bernstein estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study local growth properties of Laplace eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds. Following the paradigm introduced by Donnelly and Fefferman in the late 1980s, an eigenfunction is expected to behave locally like a polynomial of degree comparable to the square root of the eigenvalue. In this direction we establish almost sharp local $L^{p}$--Bernstein inequalities, $p\in[1,\infty]$, conjectured by Donnelly--Fefferman in 1990. We also derive analogous estimates for $A$-harmonic functions, with the square root of the eigenvalue replaced by the doubling index.
  Our argument refines the original Donnelly--Fefferman method based on $L^{2}$--Carleman estimates. At the $L^{2}$--level, we first prove a uniform bound for the doubling index on annuli of width comparable to the wavelength. This implies, with an arbitrarily small polynomial loss, the corresponding property at the $L^{p}$--level for all $p\in[1,\infty]$. The latter step relies on a bootstrap scheme combining elliptic regularity with a patching of local Carleman estimates on small balls.</description>

      <title>Local Well-posedenss of the Bartnik Static Extension Problem near Schwarzschild spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the local well-posedness of the Bartnik static metric extension problem for arbitrary Bartnik data that perturb that of any sphere in a Schwarzschild $\{t=0\}$ slice. Our result in particular includes spheres with arbitrary small mean curvature. We introduce a new framework to this extension problem by formulating the governing equations in a geodesic gauge, which reduce to a coupled system of elliptic and transport equations. Since standard function spaces for elliptic PDEs are unsuitable for transport equations, we use certain spaces of Bochner-measurable functions traditionally used to study evolution equations. In the process, we establish existence and uniqueness results for elliptic boundary value problems in such spaces in which the elliptic equations are treated as evolutionary equations, and solvability is demonstrated using rigorous energy estimates. The precise nature of the expected difficulty of solving the Bartnik extension problem when the mean curvature is very small is identified and suitably treated in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Local Well-Posedness for the Bartnik Stationary Extension Problem near Schwarzschild Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Bartnik stationary extension conjecture, which arises from the definition of the spacetime Bartnik mass for a compact region in a general initial data set satisfying the dominant energy condition. This conjecture posits the existence and uniqueness (up to isometry) of an asymptotically flat stationary vacuum spacetime containing an initial data set $(M, \mathfrak{g}, \Pi)$ that realizes prescribed Bartnik boundary data on $\partial M$, consisting of the induced metric, mean curvature, and appropriate components of the spacetime extrinsic curvature $\Pi$.
  Building on the analytic framework developed in arXiv:2411.02801 for the static case, we show that, in a double geodesic gauge, the stationary vacuum Einstein equations reduce to a coupled system comprising elliptic and transport-type equations, with the genuinely stationary contributions encoded in an additional boundary value problem for a $1$-form $\theta$.
  We establish local well-posedness for the Bartnik stationary metric extension problem for Bartnik data sufficiently close to that of any coordinate sphere in any initial data set (possibly non time-symmetric) in Schwarzschild spacetime. This includes spheres arbitrary close to the apparent horizon in the initial data set. A key feature of our framework is that the linearized equations decouple: the equations for the metric and potential reduce to the previously solved static case, while the boundary value problem for $\theta$ is treated independently. We prove solvability of this boundary value problem in the Bochner-measurable function spaces adapted to the coupled system developed in arXiv:2411.02801, establishing uniform estimates for the vector spherical harmonic decomposition of $\theta$.</description>

      <title>The capillary Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a $k$-th capillary area measure for capillary convex bodies in the Euclidean half-space, which serves as a boundary counterpart to the classical concept of area measure (see, e.g., \cite[Chapter 8]{Sch}). We then propose a Christoffel-Minkowski problem for capillary convex bodies, to find a capillary convex body in the Euclidean half-space with a prescribed $k$-th capillary area measure. This problem is equivalent to solving a Hessian-type equation with a Robin boundary value condition. We then establish the existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution under a natural sufficient condition.</description>
