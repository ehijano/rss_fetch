      <title>Coalgebraic Modal Logic for Dynamic Systems with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define a class of polynomial functors suited for constructing coalgebras representing processes in which uncertainty plays an important role. In these polynomial functors we include upper and lower probability measures, finitely additive probability measures, plausibilty measures (and their duals, belief functions), and possibility measures. We give axioms and inference rules for the associated system of coalgebraic modal logic, and construct the canonical coalgebras to prove a completeness result.</description>

      <title>Topological product of modal logics with the McKinsey axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the topological products of modal logics of S4.1 and S4. We prove that it is equal to the fusion of logics S4.1 and S4 plus one additional axiom. We also show that this product is decidable. This is an example of a topological product of logics that is greater than the fusion but less than the expanding product of the corresponding logics.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of universal algebra in a CSP dichotomy proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be formulated as a homomorphism problem between relational structures: given a structure $\mathcal{A}$, for any structure $\mathcal{X}$, whether there exists a homomorphism from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{A}$. For years, it has been conjectured that all problems of this type are divided into polynomial-time and NP-complete problems, and the conjecture was proved in 2017 separately by Zhuk (2017) and Bulatov (2017). Zhuk's algorithm solves tractable CSPs in polynomial time. The algorithm is partly based on universal algebra theorems: informally, they state that after reducing some domain of an instance to its strong subuniverses, a satisfiable instance maintains a solution.
  In this paper, we present the formalization of the proofs of these theorems in the bounded arithmetic $W^1_1$ introduced by Skelley (2004). The formalization, together with our previous results (2022), shows that $W_1^1$ proves the soundness of Zhuk's algorithm, where by soundness we mean that any rejection of the algorithm is correct. From the known relation of the theory to propositional calculus $G$, it follows that tautologies, expressing the non-existence of a solution for unsatisfiable instances, have short proofs in $G$.</description>

      <title>Admissibility of the Structural Rules in the Sequent Calculus with Equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the ground of a general theorem concerning the admissibility of the structural rules in sequent calculi with additional atomic rules, we develop a proof theoretic analysis for several extensions of the ${\bf G3[mic]}$ sequent calculi with rules for equality, including the one originally proposed by H.Wang. In the classical case we relate our results with the semantic tableau method for first order logic with equality. In particular we establish that, for languages without function symbols, in Fitting's alternative semantic tableau method, strictness (which does not allow the repetition of equalities which are modified) can be imposed together with the orientation of the replacement of equals. A significant progress is made toward extending that result to languages with function symbols although whether that is possible or not remains to be settled. We also briefly consider systems that, in the classical case, are related to the semantic tableau method in which one can expand branches by adding identities at will, obtaining that also in that case strictness can be imposed. Furthermore we discuss to what extent the strengthened form of the nonlengthening property of Orevkov known to hold for the sequent calculi with the structural rules applies also to the present context.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms and derivations on algebras endowed with formal infinite sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between automorphisms and derivations on certain algebras of generalised power series. In particular, we describe a Lie algebra of derivations on a field $k(\!(G)\!)$ of generalised power series, exploiting our knowledge of its group of valuation preserving automorphisms. The correspondence is given by the formal Taylor expansion of the exponential. In order to define the exponential map, we develop an appropriate notion of summability of infinite families in algebras. We show that there is a large class of algebras in which the exponential induces the above correspondence.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the notion of oracle: A prequel to Lawvere-Tierney topologies for computability theorists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.00188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three different perspectives of oracle. First, an oracle is a blackbox; second, an oracle is a tool to change the way we access mathematical objects; and third, an oracle is a factor that causes a change in truth values. Formally, the second perspective advocates that an oracle is an endofunctor on the category of coded sets (preserving underlying sets) -- we associate it with a universal closure operator. The third perspective advocates that an oracle is an operation on the object of truth values -- we associate it with a Lawvere-Tierney topology. These three perspectives create a link between the three fields, computability theory, synthetic descriptive set theory, and effective topos theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Adler's idea on VC minimal theories \cite{adler2008theories}, we introduce VC-minimal complexity. We show that for any $N\in\mathbb{N}^{&gt;0}$, there is $k_N&gt;0$ such that for any finite bipartite graph $(X,Y;E)$ with VC-minimal complexity $&lt; N$, there exist $X'\subseteq X$, $Y'\subseteq Y$ with $|X'|\geq k_N |X|$, $|Y'|\geq k_N |Y|$ such that $X'\times Y' \subseteq E$ or $X'\times Y'\cap E=\emptyset$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey expansions of metrically homogeneous graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.02612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Ramsey expansions, the coherent extension property for partial isometries (EPPA), and the existence of a stationary independence relation for all classes of metrically homogeneous graphs from Cherlin's catalogue. We show that, with the exception of tree-like graphs, all metric spaces in the catalogue have precompact Ramsey expansions (or lifts) with the expansion property. With two exceptions we can also characterise the existence of a stationary independence relation and coherent EPPA.
  Our results are a contribution to Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes and can be seen as empirical evidence of the recent convergence in techniques employed to establish the Ramsey property, the expansion property, EPPA and the existence of a stationary independence relation. At the heart of our proof is a canonical way of completing edge-labelled graphs to metric spaces in Cherlin's classes. The existence of such a ``completion algorithm'' then allows us to apply several strong results in the areas that imply EPPA or the Ramsey property.
  The main results have numerous consequences for the automorphism groups of the Fraisse limits of the classes. As corollaries, we prove amenability, unique ergodicity, existence of universal minimal flows, ample generics, small index property, 21-Bergman property and Serre's property (FA).</description>

      <title>Provability in BI's Sequent Calculus is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02343v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warning: This paper contains a mistake, rendering the proof of the main theorem invalid. The logic of Bunched Implications (BI) combines both additive and multiplicative connectives, which include two primitive intuitionistic implications. As a consequence, contexts in the sequent presentation are not lists, nor multisets, but rather tree-like structures called bunches. This additional complexity notwithstanding, the logic has a well-behaved metatheory admitting all the familiar forms of semantics and proof systems. However, the presentation of an effective proof-search procedure has been elusive since the logic's debut. We show that one can reduce the proof-search space for any given sequent to a primitive recursive set, the argument generalizing Gentzen's decidability argument for classical propositional logic and combining key features of Dyckhoff's contraction-elimination argument for intuitionistic logic. An effective proof-search procedure, and hence decidability of provability, follows as a corollary.</description>

      <title>Internal sums for synthetic fibered $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give structural results about bifibrations of (internal) $(\infty,1)$-categories with internal sums. This includes a higher version of Moens' Theorem, characterizing cartesian bifibrations with extensive aka stable and disjoint internal sums over lex bases as Artin gluings of lex functors.
  We also treat a generalized version of Moens' Theorem due to Streicher which does not require the Beck--Chevalley condition.
  Furthermore, we show that also in this setting the Moens fibrations can be characterized via a condition due to Zawadowski.
  Our account overall follows Streicher's presentation of fibered category theory \`{a} la B\'{e}nabou, generalizing the results to the internal, higher-categorical case, formulated in a synthetic setting.
  Namely, we work inside simplicial homotopy type theory, which has been introduced by Riehl and Shulman as a logical system to reason about internal $(\infty,1)$-categories, interpreted as Rezk objects in any given Grothendieck--Rezk--Lurie $(\infty,1)$-topos.</description>

      <title>From Basic Proof-theoretic Validity to Base-extension Semantics for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) is the approach to meaning in logic based on proof (as opposed to truth). There are two major approaches to P-tS: proof-theor\-etic validity (P-tV) and base-extension semantics (B-eS). The former is a semantics of arguments, and the latter is a semantics of logical constants. This paper demonstrates that the B-eS for intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) encapsulates the declarative content of a basic version of P-tV. Such relationships have been considered before yielding incompleteness results. This paper diverges from these approaches by accounting for the constructive, hypothetical setup of P-tV. It explicates how the B-eS for IPL works.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type theory as internal languages of diagrams of $\infty$-logoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain diagrams of $\infty$-logoses are reconstructed in internal languages of their oplax limits via lex, accessible modalities, which enables us to use plain homotopy type theory to reason about not only a single $\infty$-logos but also a diagram of $\infty$-logoses. This also provides a higher dimensional version of Sterling's synthetic Tait computability -- a type theory for higher dimensional logical relations. To prove the main result, we establish a precise correspondence between the lex, accessible localizations of an $\infty$-logos and the lex, accessible modalities in the internal language of the $\infty$-logos. To do this, we also partly develop the Kripke-Joyal semantics of homotopy type theory in $\infty$-logoses.</description>

      <title>Optimal transport for types and convex analysis for definable predicates in tracial $\mathrm{W}^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connections between continuous model theory, free probability, and optimal transport/convex analysis in the context of tracial von Neumann algebras. In particular, we give an analog of Monge-Kantorovich duality for optimal couplings where the role of probability distributions on $\mathbb{C}^n$ is played by model-theoretic types, the role of real-valued continuous functions is played by definable predicates, and the role of continuous function $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ is played by definable functions. In the process, we also advance the understanding of definable predicates and definable functions by showing that all definable predicates can be approximated by "$C^1$ definable predicates" whose gradients are definable functions. As a consequence, we show that every element in the definable closure of $\mathrm{W}^*(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ can be expressed as a definable function of $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. We give several classes of examples showing that the definable closure can be much larger than $\mathrm{W}^*(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ in general.</description>
