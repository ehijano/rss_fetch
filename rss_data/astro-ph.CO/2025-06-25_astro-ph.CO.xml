      <title>Discovery of Diffuse Radio Emission in a Massive z=1.709 Cool Core Cluster: A Candidate Radio Mini-Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies host spectacular diffuse radio sources, extending over scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint surface brightness ($\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\rm 150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\sim$$10~\mu$G levels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before $z\sim2$. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Direct reconstruction of the Reionization history from 21cm 2D Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21cm line from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen (HI) provides a unique window into the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the final phase transition of our Universe. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) enables precise measurements of 21cm fluctuations that trace ionization, temperature, and density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Nevertheless, a direct reconstruction of the timeline of the EoR in terms of the progress of ionization remains an ongoing challenge due to the highly non-Gaussian nature and thus intractable likelihood of the 21cm signal. Here, we present EoRFlow, a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for reconstructing the global neutral hydrogen fraction $x_{\mathrm{HI}}(z)$ directly from 2D cylindrically averaged power spectra (2DPS) of the 21cm signal. We validate our method on realistic mock datasets for SKA-Low. Bypassing the need for explicit likelihood formulations, our approach enables fast, unbiased posterior estimation of the $x_{\mathrm{HI}}$ evolution in narrow redshift slices, allowing for piecewise reconstruction of the global reionization history. By directly inferring the reionization history from 21cm power spectra, our framework provides a scalable and robust path forward for 21cm cosmology in the SKA era.</description>

      <title>New bounds on Axion-Like Particles in the Ultraviolet from Legacy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter. The HST data consists of blank sky observations taken with the Faint Object Spectrograph in the 165-240~nm wavelength range, while the IUE data consists of observations of the Virgo Cluster obtained with the long- and short-wavelength spectrographs, covering 195-325~nm and 123-200~nm, respectively. We set a 95\% C.L. upper limit on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 10^{-11}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ across the full ALP mass range. Notably, we rule out values of $g_{a\gamma}$ above $1.6 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses between 12.4 and 14.5\,eV, improving upon previous limits by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmological abundance of primordial black holes in mixed dark matter scenarios incorporating Kaluza-Klein dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter particles and primordial black holes (PBHs) emerge as plausible candidates for dark matter. In scenarios where dark matter is a mix of KK particles and PBHs, PBHs can attract surrounding KK dark matter particles post-formation, leading to the creation of ultracompact dark matter halos (UCMHs). The distribution of KK dark matter particles within UCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK dark matter particles in UCMHs is significant. The high-energy photons resulting from the annihilation of KK particles in UCMHs contribute to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Leveraging data from the $\mathtt{Fermi\text{-}LAT}$ experiment, we have derived, for the first time, upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs in the context of KK dark matter annihilation. For a KK dark matter mass range of $500\le m_{\rm B^{(1)}}\le 1500$ GeV, which aligns with the observed present abundance of dark matter, the conservative limits on the fraction of dark matter in PBHs, for massive PBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$, are $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 2\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Schwinger effect in axion inflation on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice simulations of the nonlinear evolution after axion inflation by self-consistently incorporating currents arising from Schwinger pair production. The tachyonically amplified gauge fields trigger the growth of Schwinger currents, leading to universal values for the conductivity and magnetic field at the onset of strong backreaction and subsequent quenching of gauge field production. We show that the Schwinger effect (prematurely) saturates gauge field production, thereby diminishing the prospects of axion inflation magnetogenesis as a viable solution for blazar observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological bounds on dark matter annihilation using dark ages 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the global 21-cm signal during the dark ages and cosmic dawn eras. The 21-cm line provides a complementary probe for studying the nature of dark matter beyond standard cosmological observables. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the expected absorption amplitude of the dark ages global 21-cm signal is approximately $-42\, \rm mK$. However, energy injection from DM annihilation can significantly heat and ionize the intergalactic medium, potentially altering or even erasing this absorption feature. We evaluate the thermal and ionization history of the gas to derive an upper bound on $f_\chi^2 \langle \sigma v \rangle / M_\chi$ using the dark ages signal, which is free from astrophysical uncertainties. After incorporating observational and theoretical uncertainties arising from future lunar-based experiments and variations in cosmological parameters, respectively -- we obtain a conservative upper limit of $f_\chi^2\langle\sigma v\rangle/M_\chi \lesssim 10^{-28}~\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. This constraint is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than the bounds derived from Planck 2018 data.</description>

      <title>An iterative CMB lensing estimator minimizing instrumental noise bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise maps from CMB experiments are generally statistically anisotropic, due to scanning strategies, atmospheric conditions, or instrumental effects. Any mis-modeling of this complex noise can bias the reconstruction of the lensing potential and the measurement of the lensing power spectrum from the observed CMB maps. We introduce a new CMB lensing estimator based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction that is minimally sensitive to these instrumental noise biases. By modifying the likelihood to rely exclusively on correlations between CMB map splits with independent noise realizations, we minimize auto-correlations that contribute to biases. In the regime of many independent splits, this maximum closely approximates the optimal MAP reconstruction of the lensing potential. In simulations, we demonstrate that this method is able to determine lensing observables that are immune to any noise mis-modeling with a negligible cost in signal-to-noise ratio. Our estimator enables unbiased and nearly optimal lensing reconstruction for next-generation CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Domain Walls from Super-Cooling First Order Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion is a well-motivated hypothetical particle beyond the Standard Model (SM) and a compelling dark matter candidate. Its relic abundance is highly sensitive to the thermal history of the universe when the temperature is around the QCD confinement scale. Meanwhile, the NANOGrav Collaboration has reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background, which could originate from a supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) with a nucleation temperature around the O(MeV-GeV) scale. We explore how such an FOPT might alter the evolution of the QCD axion. Our findings suggest that it could induce the axion to go through a short stage of mini kinetic misalignment. Moreover, in some parameter regime, the formation of QCD axion domain walls becomes generically expected. This has intriguing implications for both the existence of the QCD axion and the FOPT interpretation of the NANOGrav signal.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Posteriors with Stellar Population Synthesis on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) provide a predictive framework for the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy. SPS predictions can be computationally intensive, creating a bottleneck for attempts to infer the physical properties of large populations of individual galaxies from their SEDs and photometry; these computational challenges are especially daunting for near-future cosmology surveys that will measure the photometry of billions of galaxies. In this paper, we explore a range of computational techniques aimed at accelerating SPS predictions of galaxy photometry using the JAX library to target GPUs. We study a particularly advantageous approximation to the calculation of galaxy photometry that speeds up the computation by a factor of 50 relative to the exact calculation. We introduce a novel technique for incorporating burstiness into models of galaxy star formation history that captures very short-timescale fluctuations with negligible increase in computation time. We study the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms in which individual chains are parallelized across independent GPU threads, finding that our pipeline can carry out Bayesian inference at a rate of approximately $1,000$ galaxy posteriors per GPU-minute. Our results provide an update to standard benchmarks in the literature on the computational demands of SPS inference; our publicly available code enables previously-impractical Bayesian analyses of large galaxy samples, and includes several standalone modules that could be adopted to speedup existing SPS pipelines.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to modelling spectrometer data chromaticity corrected using beam factors -- II. Model priors and posterior odds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable detection of the global 21-cm signal, a key tracer of Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, requires meticulous data modelling and robust statistical frameworks for model validation and comparison. In Paper I of this series, we presented the Beam-Factor-based Chromaticity Correction (BFCC) model for spectrometer data processed using BFCC to suppress instrumentally induced spectral structure. We demonstrated that the BFCC model, with complexity calibrated by Bayes factor-based model comparison (BFBMC), enables unbiased recovery of a 21-cm signal consistent with the one reported by EDGES from simulated data. Here, we extend the evaluation of the BFCC model to lower amplitude 21-cm signal scenarios where deriving reliable conclusions about a model's capacity to recover unbiased 21-cm signal estimates using BFBMC is more challenging. Using realistic simulations of chromaticity-corrected EDGES-low spectrometer data, we evaluate three signal amplitude regimes -- null, moderate, and high. We then conduct a Bayesian comparison between the BFCC model and three alternative models previously applied to 21-cm signal estimation from EDGES data. To mitigate biases introduced by systematics in the 21-cm signal model fit, we incorporate the Bayesian Null-Test-Evidence-Ratio (BaNTER) validation framework and implement a Bayesian inference workflow based on posterior odds of the validated models. We demonstrate that, unlike BFBMC alone, this approach consistently recovers 21-cm signal estimates that align with the true signal across all amplitude regimes, advancing robust global 21-cm signal detection methodologies.</description>

      <title>WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which were formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may be in existence today and become a candidate for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via Hawking radiation of PBHs, and survived PBHs via the memory burden effect. In addition, feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are considered as an alternative to WIMPs. Various similar studies have been conducted either with or without considering the memory burden effect. In this study, we simultaneously account for thermally produced WIMPs or FIMPs and the memory burden effect of PBHs to explain the relic abundance of DM. We show that this abundance is highly sensitive to the memory burden effect in PBHs.</description>

      <title>A gas-rich cosmic web revealed by the partitioning of the missing baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximately half of the Universe's dark matter resides in collapsed halos; significantly less than half of the baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) remains confined to halos. A small fraction of baryons are in stars and the interstellar medium within galaxies. The lion's share are diffuse ($&lt;$10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) and ionized (neutral fraction $&lt;$10$^{-4}$), located in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and in the halos of galaxy clusters, groups, and galaxies. This diffuse ionized gas is notoriously difficult to measure, but has wide implications for galaxy formation, astrophysical feedback, and precision cosmology. Recently, the dispersion of extragalactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has been used to measure the total content of cosmic baryons. Here, we present a large cosmological sample of FRB sources localized to their host galaxies. We have robustly partitioned the missing baryons into the IGM, galaxy clusters, and galaxies, providing a late-Universe measurement of the total baryon density of $\Omega_b\,h_{70} = 0.051_{-0.006}^{+0.006}$. Our results indicate efficient feedback processes that can deplete galaxy halos and enrich the IGM ($f_{\rm IGM}=0.76_{-0.11}^{+0.10}$), agreeing with the baryon-rich cosmic web scenario seen in cosmological simulations. Our results may reduce the ``$S_8$ tension'' in cosmology, as strong feedback leads to suppression of the matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Reionization On Computers: Biases and Uncertainties in the Measured Mean Free Path at the End Stage of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations and analyses of absorption in quasar spectra suggest a rapid drop in the mean free path (MFP) at the late stage of reionization at $z\sim6$. We use the Cosmic Reionization on Computers simulation to examine potential biases in observed measurements of the MFP at the late stage of reionization, particularly in the presence of a quasar. We analyze three snapshots surrounding the `ankle' point of reionization history, when extended neutral patches of the intergalactic medium disappeared in the simulation box. Specifically, these are $z=6.8$ (true MFP $\approx 0.4$ pMpc), in addition to $z=6.1$ (true MFP $\approx 2$ pMpc) and $z=5.4$ (true MFP $\approx 6$ pMpc). We compare the inferred MFP $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$ from synthetic spectra fits to the true MFP. We find that the mean Lyman continuum (LyC) profile at $z=6.8$ changes significantly with quasar lifetime $t_Q$. We attribute this sensitivity to $t_Q$ to a combination of extended neutral IGM patches and the prevalence of small-scale dense clumps. Consequently, the inferred MFP can be biased by a factor of few depending on $t_Q$. On the other hand, for the $z=6.1$ and $z=5.4$ snapshots, the mean LyC profile shows minimal sensitivity to variation in $t_Q\gtrsim 1$ Myr. The inferred MFP in these two cases is accurate to the $\lesssim 30\%$ level. Our results highlight how modeling systematics can affect the inferred MFP, particularly in the regime of small true MFP ($\lesssim 0.5$ pMpc). We also discuss the potential of this regime to provide a testing ground for constraining quasar lifetimes from LyC profiles.</description>

      <title>Rapid identification of lensed type Ia supernovae with color-magnitude selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide a unique cosmological probe to address the Hubble tension problem in cosmology. In addition to the sensitivity of the time delays to the value of the Hubble constant, the transient and standard candle nature of SNe Ia also enable valuable joint constraints on the model of the lens and the cosmological parameters. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to increase the number of observed SNe Ia by an order of magnitude in ten years of its lifetime. However, finding such systems in the LSST data is a challenge. In this work, we revisit the color-magnitude (CM) diagram used previously as a means to identify lensed SNe Ia and extend the work further as follows. We simulate LSST-like photometric data ($rizy$-bands) of lensed SNe Ia and analyze it in the CM parameter space. We find that a subset of lensed SNe Ia are redder compared to unlensed SNe Ia at a given magnitude, both in the rising and falling phases of their light curves and for SNe up to $z=3$. We propose a modified selection criterion based on these new results. We show that the contamination coming from unlensed core-collapse (CC) SNe is negligible, whereas a small fraction of lensed CC SNe types Ib and Ic may get selected by this criterion as potential lensed SNe. Finally, we demonstrate that our criterion works well on a wide sample of observed unlensed SNe Ia, a handful of known multiply-imaged lensed SNe systems, and a representative sample of observed CC SNe as well as super-luminous supernovae.</description>

      <title>Primordial Power Spectrum of Five Dimensional Uniform Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Five dimensional (5D) uniform inflation describes a de Sitter (or approximate) solution of 5D Einstein equations, with cosmological constant and a 5D Planck scale $M_* \sim 10^9$ GeV. During the inflationary period all dimensions (compact and non-compact) expand exponentially in terms of the 5D proper time. This set-up requires about 40 $e$-folds to expand the fifth dimension from the fundamental length to the micron size. At the end of 5D inflation (or at any given moment during the inflationary phase) one can interpret the solution in terms of 4D fields using 4D Planck units from the relation $M_p^2 = 2 \pi R M_*^3$, which amounts going to the 4D Einstein frame. This implies that if the compactification radius $R$ expands $N$ $e$-folds, then the 3D space would expand $3N/2$ $e$-folds as a result of a uniform 5D inflation. We reexamine the primordial power spectrum predicted by this model and show that it is consistent with Planck's measurements of the comic microwave background. The best-fit to Planck data corresponds to $R \sim 10~\mu$m. A departure of the angular power spectrum predicted by 4D cosmology is visible at multipole moment $\ell \sim 7$.</description>

      <title>CMB lensing tomography with clustering estimation of lens redshift distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a clustering-based redshift estimation approach for CMB lensing tomography, focusing on the kernel function of the lensing galaxies. Within a linear galaxy bias framework, we derive estimators for this kernel from two-point cross-correlations between lens mass and reference samples. The reconstructed kernel then enables a theoretical prediction for the angular cross-power spectrum \(C_{g\kappa}\) between CMB lensing convergence and lens galaxies. As a proof of concept, we measure \(C_{g\kappa}\) by correlating the \emph{Planck} PR4 convergence map with NVSS+SUMSS radio galaxies (\(0\lesssim z\lesssim 3\)). We estimate the radio-galaxy kernel by collectively cross-correlating their distribution with spectroscopic and photometric surveys (2MPZ, LOWZ-CMASS, eBOSS DR16 LRGs, and Gaia-unWISE QSOs). From the measured \(C_{g\kappa}\), we obtain \(\sigma_8 = 0.86^{+0.12}_{-0.09}\) when the density parameter is set to the {\it Planck} value of $\Omega_m = 0.315$; this is in good agreement with the \emph{Planck} normalisation of $\sigma_8 = 0.812$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the inflaton potential from scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plateau on the background inflaton potential $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ can lead cosmic inflation into an ultraslow-roll phase, greatly enhancing the primordial power spectrum on small scales, and resulting in intensive scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) and abundant primordial black holes (PBHs). In this work, we construct an anti-symmetric perturbation $\delta V(\phi)$ on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ with three model parameters, the position, width, and slope of $\delta V(\phi)$, and constrain these parameters from the potential stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. The GW spectrum from the merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with two model parameters, the amplitude and spectral index, is also investigated for comparison. We perform Bayesian analysis in three steps with increasing number of model parameters, and obtain the allowed parameter ranges. When the constraints on PBH abundance are taken into account, these ranges become further narrower. We find that the increase of model parameters cannot significantly improve the Bayes factors, and the model with an almost perfect plateau on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ is favored. Moreover, the interpretation of the SGWB only via the GWs generated by SMBHBs is not preferred by the data. Two different forms of $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ are considered, and the analogous results confirm the generality and robustness of our work.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of ultralight complex scalar field dark matter and its impact on the growth of structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass window of ultralight axion dark matter motivated by suppressing the growth of structure on subgalactic scales, $m\sim 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}$, is now severely constrained by various observation data (e.g. Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). As an attempt to reopen this mass window, we investigate an alternative ultralight dark matter candidate, the complex scalar field dark matter (SFDM). We derive the relativistic hydrodynamics of the complex SFDM in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Our formalism contains two novel ingredients uniquely associated with the complex SFDM model: the Eckart frame defined by the conserved Noether current, and the stiff gauge condition, $c_s^2\equiv (\delta P/\delta\rho)|_s=1$. In the Eckart frame, the complex SFDM is effectively an imperfect fluid with a dissipative energy flux, distinguishing itself from axion dark matter. The energy flux can affect the growth of density fluctuations dynamically. Meanwhile, we apply the stiff gauge condition to find new constitutive equations for the complex SFDM. We revisit the homogeneous evolution of the complex SFDM and present illustrative early-stage solutions for perturbations of the complex SFDM in a simplified setting. We demonstrate the effects of varying the model parameters on the evolution of the perturbation variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Collaboration have moved the preferred perturbation spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ towards one. We reanalyse constraints on the simplest version of the curvaton model, using $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that in the massless curvaton case the model gives the same locus of $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ predictions as the power-law model $V(\phi) \propto \phi^p$, but with a different and more elegant physical interpretation. The model gives an excellent account of current observational data, both in the regime where the curvaton dominates the observed perturbations and with an admixture of inflaton-originated perturbations of up to about one-third of the total. Addition of the newest South Pole Telescope SPT-3G D1 dataset maintains this conclusion in favor of the curvaton model. Forthcoming large-scale structure surveys, such as that of the recently-launched SPHEREx probe, could discriminate between curvaton and single-field inflation models using the bispectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The richest and largest structures in the cosmic web are galaxy superclusters, their complexes (associations of several almost connected very rich superclusters), and planes. Superclusters represent a special environment where the evolution of galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters differs from the evolution of these systems in a low-density environment. The richest galaxy clusters reside in superclusters. The richest superclusters in the nearby Universe form a quasiregular pattern with the characteristic distance between superclusters 120 - 140 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Moreover, superclusters in the nearby Universe lie in two huge perpendicular planes with the extent of several hundreds of megaparsecs, the Local Supercluster plane and the Dominant supercluster plane. The origin of these patterns in the supercluster distribution is not yet clear, and it is an open question whether the presence of such structures can be explained within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This review presents a brief story of superclusters, their discovery, definitions, main properties, and large-scale distribution.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO 2025: Cosmological constraints from strong lensing time delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RX J1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM), we find $H_0=71.6^{+3.9}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use late Universe probes - Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus compilation, Quasars, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data - along with Cosmic Chronometers or Megamasers to constrain various dark energy parameterizations. These include the standard $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_0=-1,w_a=0$), as well as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Exponential (EXP), and Transitional Dark Energy (TDE) parameterizations. We find that across all parameterizations, the constrained values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ remain within $(1-2)\sigma$ of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, irrespective of spatial curvature, dataset combinations, or prior choices. We find from Bayesian model comparison that $\Lambda$CDM remains the most favored model for both flat and non-flat cases, with results remaining robust under different priors. Across all dataset combinations, we reaffirm the fact that LRG1 and LRG2 data points from the DESI BAO dataset are responsible for driving the preference for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission in IllustrisTNG circum-cluster environments. II -- Possible origins of the soft X-ray excess emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An excess of soft X-ray emission (0.2-1 keV) above the contribution from the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) has been detected in a number of galaxy clusters, including the Coma cluster. The physical origin of this emitting medium above hot ICM has not yet been determined, especially whether it be thermal or non-thermal. We aim to investigate which gas phase and gas structure more accurately reproduce the soft excess radiation from the cluster core to the outskirts, using simulations. By using the simulation TNG300, we predict the radial profile of thermodynamic properties and the Soft-X-ray surface brightness of 138 clusters within 5 $R_{200}$. Their X-ray emission is simulated for the hot ICM gas phase, the entire Warm-Hot medium, the diffuse and low-density Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). Inside clusters, the soft excess appears to be produced by substructures of the WARM gas phase which host dense warm clumps (i.e, the Warm Circum-Galactic Medium, WCGM), and in fact the inner soft excess is strongly correlated with substructure and WCGM mass fractions. Outside of the virial radius, the fraction of WHIM gas that is mostly inside filaments connected to clusters boosts the soft X-ray excess. The more diffuse the gas is, the higher the soft X-ray excess beyond the virial region. The thermal emission of WARM gas phase, in the form of WCGM clumps and WHIM diffuse filaments, reproduces well the soft excess emission that was observed up to the virial radius in Coma and in the inner regions of other massive clusters. Moreover, our analysis suggests that soft X-ray excess is a proxy of cluster dynamical state, with larger excess being observed in the most unrelaxed clusters.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Quasar Spectra and Measuring the Ly$\alpha$ Forest with ${\rm S{\scriptsize pender}Q}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasar spectra carry the imprint of foreground intergalactic medium (IGM) through absorption features. In particular, absorption caused by neutral hydrogen gas, the ``Ly$\alpha$ forest,'' is a key spectroscopic tracer for cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring LyA absorption cannot directly derive the intrinsic quasar continuum and make strong assumptions on its shape, thus distorting the measured LyA clustering. We present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for directly reconstructing the intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the LyA forest from observations. SpenderQ uses the Spender spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and redshift-invariant latent encoding of quasar spectra, combined with an iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions. To demonstrate its performance, we apply SpenderQ to 400,000 synthetic quasar spectra created to validate the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 LyA cosmological analyses. SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra, including the broad LyB, LyA, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines. Redward of LyA, SpenderQ provides percent-level reconstructions of the true quasar spectra. Blueward of LyA, SpenderQ reconstructs the true spectra to &lt; 5\%. SpenderQ reproduces the shapes of individual quasar spectra more robustly than the current state-of-the-art. We, thus, expect it will significantly reduce biases in LyA clustering measurements and enable studies of quasars and their physical properties. SpenderQ also provides informative latent variable encodings that can be used to, e.g., classify quasars with Broad Absorption Lines. Overall, SpenderQ provides a new data-driven approach for unbiased LyA forest measurements in cosmological, quasar, and IGM studies.</description>

      <title>On the inefficiency of fermion level-crossing under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational chiral anomaly connects the topological charge of spacetime and the chirality of fermions. It has been known that the chirality is carried by the particles (or the excited states) and also by vacuum. While the gravitational anomaly equation has been applied to cosmology, distinction between these two contributions has been rarely discussed. In the study of gravitational leptogenesis, for example, lepton asymmetry associated with the chiral gravitational waves (GWs) sourced during inflation is evaluated only by integrating the anomaly equation. This approach, however, does not reveal how these two contributions are distributed in this scenario. Meanwhile, the dominance of vacuum contribution is observed in some specific types of Bianchi spacetime with parity-violating gravitational fields. One may wonder whether such a vacuum dominance takes place also in the system with chiral GWs around the flat background, which is more suitable for application to realistic cosmology. In this work, we apply an analogy between U(1) electromagnetism and the weak gravity to the spacetime that captures the characteristics of the one considered in the gravitational leptogenesis. With this approach, we try to obtain intuitive understanding of the fermion chirality generation under the parity-violating spin-2 gravitational field. By assuming the emergence of Landau level-like dispersion relation in our setup, we observe that spin-2 nature seems to make the level-crossing inefficient, indicating that the chrial charge is likely to accumulate in the vacuum. On this basis, phenomenological implications for gravitational leptogenesis are discussed.</description>

      <title>Heating the dark matter halo with dark radiation from supernovae</title>

Abstract: Supernova explosions are among the most extreme events in the Universe, making them a promising environment in which to search for the effects of light, weakly coupled new particles. As significant sources of energy, they are known to have an important effect on the dynamics of ordinary matter in their host galaxies but their potential impact on the dark matter (DM) halo remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the possibility that some fraction of the supernova energy is released via the form of dark radiation into the DM halo. Based on evaluation of energetics, we find that even a small fraction of the total SN energy is sufficient to change the overall shape of the DM halo and transform a cuspy halo into a cored one. This may help to explain the cores that are observed in some dwarf galaxies. Alternatively, one can interpret the upper limit on the size of a possible DM core as an upper limit on the energy that can go into light particles beyond the SM. These arguments are largely independent of a concrete model for the new physics. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the conditions we need, i.e.~significant supernova emissivity of dark radiation and the opacity of DM halo to the dark radiation, can be met in actual models. To demonstrate this, we study four simple benchmark models: the dark photon, dark Higgs, and gauged $B-L$ and $L_\mu - L_\tau$ models -- all provide light weakly coupled particles serving as the dark radiation. Assuming a sizable coupling of the dark radiation to DM, we find that all of the benchmark models have a significant part of the parameter space that meets the conditions. Interestingly, the couplings allowed by observations of SN1987A can have a significant effect on the halo of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Impact of the cosmic neutrino background on black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the effect of the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) on superradiant instabilities caused by an ultralight scalar field around spinning black holes (BHs). When the scalar couples to neutrinos via a Yukawa interaction, thermal corrections from the C$\nu$B induce a quartic self-interaction and an effective mass term for the scalar. We show that, for Yukawa couplings as small as $y_{\phi \nu} \sim 10^{-16}$ (for astrophysical BHs) or $10^{-20}$ (for supermassive BHs), the quartic term can quench the instability and set observable bounds, even if the scalar does not constitute dark matter. We assess the robustness of these constraints against several sources of uncertainty, including gravitational focusing of relic neutrinos, galactic clustering, and non-linear backreaction. An enhanced local neutrino density weakens the bounds by up to an order of magnitude compared to a uniform background, yet the induced self-interaction remains strong enough to significantly affect the superradiant dynamics. Our results open a new observational window on neutrino-coupled scalars via BH superradiance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on asteroid-mass primordial black holes in dwarf galaxies using Hubble Space Telescope photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass range remain a viable and until now unconstrained dark matter (DM) candidate. If such PBHs exist, they could be captured by stars in DM-dominated environments with low velocity dispersion such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). The capture probability increases with the stellar mass, and captured PBHs would rapidly destroy their host stars. As a result, the presence of PBHs in UFDs would alter their stellar mass functions. Using photometric observations of three ultra-faint dwarf galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that it is unlikely that their mass functions have been significantly modified by PBHs, and we place constraints on the PBH abundance. In the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Triangulum II, PBHs around $10^{19}$g are excluded at the $2\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) level from constituting more than $\sim55\%$ ($\sim78\%$) of the dark matter, while the possibility that PBHs represent the entirety of the DM is excluded at the $3.7\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Metastable Strings in SO(10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \times U(1)_\chi$ yields the GUT monopole as well as a comparably heavy $U(1)_\chi$ monopole which also carries $U(1)_Y$ flux. A metastable string scenario in this case requires that the $U(1)_\chi$ symmetry is necessarily broken close to the GUT scale, thus resulting in a dimensionless string tension $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$. We show that the $\chi$ monopole does not carry any unconfined flux following the electroweak symmetry breaking. Coupled with $G \mu \sim 10^{-6}$, this metastable string network appears to provide a good fit to the recent Pulsar Timing Array data on the stochastic gravitational background. Gauge coupling unification, especially in the presence of low scale supersymmetry, determines the GUT scale and, in combination with constraints from proton decay experiments, one is able to constrain some of the key parameters in this setup. The breaking of $SO(10)$ via $SU(5) \times U(1)_\chi$ also yields superheavy metastable strings with no unconfined flux associated with the monopoles. Finally, we consider $SO(10)$ breaking via $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R$, $SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ and flipped $SU(5)$ that yield metastable strings where the associated monopoles carry unconfined flux after the electroweak breaking.</description>

      <title>Survival of dust in super-dusty galaxies at redshifts $z \approx 5-8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of dust in galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;5$ is commonly connected with core collapse supernovae (SN). Galaxies with exceptionally large dust mass, of order of $1 - 3$\% of the galaxy stellar mass, have been detected during the last decade. The required SN dust yield is $\gtrsim 1~M_\odot$ per supernova, which is comparable to the theoretically predicted maximum. However, the reverse shock (RS) penetrating the SN ejecta significantly destroy the dust particles nucleating there through sputtering. The resulting net dust mass injected into the interstellar gas after processing by the RS turns out to be $\lesssim 0.1~M_\odot$ per SN. This makes the explanation of the existence of $z&gt;5$ galaxies with dust masses as high as $M_d\gtrsim (0.01-0.03)M_\ast$ a challenging one. In this paper we present arguments in favor of an efficient inhibition of the sputtering behind the RS, caused by a strong radiation cooling from the dust in the supernova ejecta.</description>

      <title>Overmassive Black holes live in compact galaxies in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant population of quasars have been found to exist within the first Gyr of cosmic time. Most of them have high black hole (BH) masses ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8-10} M_{\odot}$) with an elevated BH-to-stellar mass ratio compared to typical local galaxies, posing challenges to our understanding of the formation of supermassive BHs and their coevolution with host galaxies. Here, based on size measurements of [CII] 158$\mu$m emission for a statistical sample of $z \sim 6$ quasars, we find that their host galaxies are systematically more compact (with half-light radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 1.6$ kpc) than typical star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. Specifically, the sizes of the most compact quasar hosts, which also tend to contain less cold gas than their more extended counterparts, are comparable to that of massive quiescent galaxies at $z \sim 4-5$. These findings reveal an intimate connection between the formation of massive BHs and compactness of their host galaxies in the early universe. These compact quasar hosts are promising progenitors of the first population of quiescent galaxies.</description>
