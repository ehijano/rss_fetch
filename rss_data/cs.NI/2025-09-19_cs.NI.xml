      <title>A Software-Defined Radio Testbed for Distributed LiDAR Point Cloud Sharing with IEEE 802.11p in V2V Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Software Defined Radio (SDR)-based IEEE 802.11p testbed for distributed Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. The platform bridges the gap between network simulation and deployment by providing a modular codebase configured for cost-effective ADALM-Pluto SDRs. Any device capable of running a Docker with ROS, executing Matlab and interface with a Pluto via USB can act as a communication node. To demonstrate collaborative sensing, we share LiDAR point clouds between nodes and fuse them into a collective perception environment. We evaluated a theoretical model for leveraging decentralized storage systems (IPFS and Filecoin), analyzing constraints such as node storage convergence, latency, and scalability. In addition, we provide a channel quality study.</description>

      <title>Chameleon: Integrated Sensing and Communication with Sub-Symbol Beam Switching in mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation cellular networks are envisioned to integrate sensing capabilities with communication, particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, where beamforming using large-scale antenna arrays enables directional signal transmissions for improved spatial multiplexing. In current 5G networks, however, beamforming is typically designed either for communication or sensing (e.g., beam training during link establishment). In this paper, we present Chameleon, a novel framework that augments and rapidly switches beamformers during each demodulation reference signal (DMRS) symbol to achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 5G mmWave networks. Each beamformer introduces an additional sensing beam toward target angles while maintaining the communication beams toward multiple users. We implement Chameleon on a 28 GHz software-defined radio testbed supporting over-the-air 5G physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmissions. Extensive experiments in open environments show that Chameleon achieves multi-user communication with a sum data rate of up to 0.80 Gbps across two users. Simultaneously, Chameleon employs a beamformer switching interval of only 0.24 {\mu}s, therefore producing a 31x31-point 2D imaging within just 0.875 ms. Leveraging machine learning, Chameleon further enables object localization with median errors of 0.14 m (distance) and 0.24{\deg} (angle), and material classification with 99.0% accuracy.</description>

      <title>1Q: First-Generation Wireless Systems Integrating Classical and Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We sketch out the concept of 1Q, the first wireless generation of integrated classical and quantum communication. The 1Q framework features quantum base stations (QBSs) that support entanglement distribution via free-space optical links alongside traditional radio communications. Key new components include quantum cells, quantum user equipment (QUEs), and hybrid resource allocation spanning classical time-frequency and quantum entanglement domains. Several application scenarios are discussed and illustrated through system design requirements for quantum key distribution, blind quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. A range of unique quantum constraints are identified, including decoherence timing, fidelity requirements, and the interplay between quantum and classical error probabilities. Protocol adaptations extend cellular connection management to incorporate entanglement generation, distribution, and handover procedures, expanding the Quantum Internet to the cellular wireless.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Multi-Agent Vehicular Planning for Battery Efficiency and QoS in 6G Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While simulators exist for vehicular IoT nodes communicating with the Cloud through Edge nodes in a fully-simulated osmotic architecture, they often lack support for dynamic agent planning and optimisation to minimise vehicular battery consumption while ensuring fair communication times. Addressing these challenges requires extending current simulator architectures with AI algorithms for both traffic prediction and dynamic agent planning. This paper presents an extension of SimulatorOrchestrator (SO) to meet these requirements. Preliminary results over a realistic urban dataset show that utilising vehicular planning algorithms can lead to improved battery and QoS performance compared with traditional shortest path algorithms. The additional inclusion of desirability areas enabled more ambulances to be routed to their target destinations while utilising less energy to do so, compared to traditional and weighted algorithms without desirability considerations.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Impact of Location Uncertainty on Radio Map-Based Predictive Rate Selection via Noisy-Input Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a predictive rate-selection framework based on Gaussian process (GP)-based radio map construction that is robust to location uncertainty. Radio maps are a promising tool for improving communication efficiency in 6G networks. Although they enable the design of location-based maximum transmission rates by exploiting statistical channel information, existing discussions often assume perfect (i.e., noiseless) location information during channel sensing. Since such information must be obtained from positioning systems such as global navigation satellite systems, it inevitably involves positioning errors; this location uncertainty can degrade the reliability of radio map-based wireless systems. To mitigate this issue, we introduce the noisy-input GP (NIGP), which treats location noise as additional output noise by applying a Taylor approximation of the function of interest. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NIGP-based design achieves more reliable transmission-rate selection than pure GP and yields higher throughput than path loss-based rate selection.</description>

      <title>Self-Explaining Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Network Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods that incorporate deep neural networks (DNN), though powerful, often lack transparency. Their black-box characteristic hinders interpretability and reduces trustworthiness, particularly in critical domains. To address this challenge in RL tasks, we propose a solution based on Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) along with explanation extraction methods to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our approach targets low-dimensionality problems to generate robust local and global explanations of the model's behaviour. We evaluate the proposed method on the resource allocation problem in mobile networks, demonstrating that SENNs can constitute interpretable solutions with competitive performance. This work highlights the potential of SENNs to improve transparency and trust in AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional tasks. Our approach strong performance on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while providing robust explanations.</description>

      <title>FAWN: A MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for Integrated Sensing and Communication Indoor Scene Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming generations of wireless technologies promise an era where everything is interconnected and intelligent. As the need for intelligence grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However, deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge. Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference. FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution, we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.</description>

      <title>Attention Beyond Neighborhoods: Reviving Transformer for Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become a cornerstone in modern neural networks, driving breakthroughs across diverse domains. However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Experience Replay in Non-stationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments is challenging, as changing dynamics and rewards quickly make past experiences outdated. Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes. DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.</description>

      <title>Version Age of Information with Contact Mobility in Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.</description>

      <title>Pipelining Split Learning in Multi-hop Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support large-scale model training, split learning (SL) enables multiple edge devices/servers to share the intensive training workload. However, most existing works on SL focus solely on two-tier model splitting. Moreover, while some recent works have investigated the model splitting and placement problems for multi-hop SL, these solutions fail to overcome the resource idleness issue, resulting in significant network idle time. In this work, we propose a pipelined SL scheme by addressing the joint optimization problem of model splitting and placement (MSP) in multi-hop edge networks. By applying pipeline parallelism to SL, we identify that the MSP problem can be mapped to a problem of minimizing the weighted sum of a bottleneck cost function (min-max) and a linear cost function (min-sum). Based on graph theory, we devise a bottleneck-aware shortest-path algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Besides, given the MSP outcomes, we also derive the closed-form solution to the micro-batch size in the pipeline. Finally, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm of MSP and micro-batch size to solve the joint optimization problem to minimize the end-to-end training latency. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the significant advantages of our algorithm compared to existing benchmarks without pipeline parallelism.</description>
