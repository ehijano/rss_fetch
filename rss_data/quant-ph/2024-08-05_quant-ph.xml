      <title>Qubernetes: Towards a Unified Cloud-Native Execution Platform for Hybrid Classic-Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks.
  Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale.
  Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware.
  Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem.
  Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realised without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signal Processing and Quantum Singular Value Transformation on $U(N)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing and quantum singular value transformation are powerful tools to implement polynomial transformations of block-encoded matrices on quantum computers, and has achieved asymptotically optimal complexity in many prominent quantum algorithms. We propose a framework of quantum signal processing and quantum singular value transformation on $U(N)$, which realizes multiple polynomials simultaneously from a block-encoded input, as a generalization of those on $U(2)$ in the original frameworks. We also perform a comprehensive analysis on achievable polynomials and give a recursive algorithm to construct the quantum circuit that gives the desired polynomial transformation. As an example application, the new framework is used to construct the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm with asymptotically optimal query complexity. Based on this framework, we also propose a framework to realize multi-variate polynomial functions for commutative variables.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise modeling through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of quantum computing, robust and efficient tools are essential to bridge the gap between simulations and quantum hardware execution. In this work, we introduce a machine learning approach to characterize the noise impacting a quantum chip and emulate it during simulations. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing various noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized benchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has been validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits. Additionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Relation of curvature and torsion of weighted graph states with graph properties and its studies on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states of spin systems that can be represented with weighted graphs $G(V, E)$ are studied. The geometrical characteristics of these states are examined. We find that the velocity of quantum evolution is determined by the sum of the weighted degrees of the nodes in the graph, constructed by raising to the second power the weights in $G(V, E)$. The curvature depends on the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes in graphs constructed by raising the weights in $G(V, E)$ to the second and fourth powers. It also depends on the sum of the products of the weights of edges forming squares in graph $G(V, E)$. The torsion in addition is related to the sum of the products of the weights of edges in graph $G(V, E)$ forming triangles $S_3$. Geometric properties of quantum graph states and the sum of the weighted degrees of nodes have been calculated with quantum programming on IBM's quantum computer for the case of a spin chain.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with $O(1)$-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states $\unicode{x2013}$ states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium $\unicode{x2013}$ has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we present a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to sample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian's interaction graph.</description>

      <title>Operator space fragmentation in perturbed Floquet-Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p &lt; 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum-mechanical two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with an electric field confined to a circular box of impenetrable walls. In order to obtain the energy spectrum we resort to the Rayleigh-Ritz method with polynomial and Gaussian basis sets. We compare present results with those derived recently by other authors. We discuss the limits of large and small box radius and also do some calculations with perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interference in edge state pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adiabatic edge state pumping (ESP) in one dimensional model, which has important applications in topological phase transition and the associated implementation of edge states in quantum simulation, has been widely performed in both theories and experiments. This phenomenon has been verified in some small physical models, yet some fundamental issues about this process have not been clarified. In this paper, we revisit this problem of ESP and pinpoint a pair of non-adiabatic points in the band levels, at which the adiabatic condition breaks down. We determine the two points using the criteria of non-adiabaticity. As a result, the oscillation of ESP as evolution time varies can be resolved in terms of Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg (LZS) interference. Furthermore, in the presence of disorder, we show that the ESP may break down for the anticrossing between the edge and the bulk levels, where the non-adiabaticity diverges. Thus in a relatively long chain with weak disorder, we demonstrate the failure of the ESP. This new type of ESP unveiled in this work is readily accessible in experiment, and shall therefore lead to a down-to-earth platform for the intriguing LZS dynamics.</description>

      <title>Real World Application of Quantum-Classical Optimization for Production Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a benchmark study for quantum-classical computing method with a real-world optimization problem from industry. The problem involves scheduling and balancing jobs on different machines, with a non-linear objective function. We first present the motivation and the problem description, along with different modeling techniques for classical and quantum computing. The modeling for classical solvers has been done as a mixed-integer convex program, while for the quantum-classical solver we model the problem as a binary quadratic program, which is best suited to the D-Wave Leap's Hybrid Solver. This ensures that all the solvers we use are fetched with dedicated and most suitable model(s). Henceforth, we carry out benchmarking and comparisons between classical and quantum-classical methods, on problem sizes ranging till approximately 150000 variables. We utilize an industry grade classical solver and compare its results with D-Wave Leap's Hybrid Solver. The results we obtain from D-Wave are highly competitive and sometimes offer speedups, compared to the classical solver.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Measuring Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve computational problems significantly faster than classical computers. These 'speed-ups' are achieved by utilizing a resource known as magic. Measuring the amount of magic used by a device allows us to quantify its potential computational power. Without this property, quantum computers are no faster than classical computers. Whether magic can be accurately measured on large-scale quantum computers has remained an open problem. To address this question, we introduce Pauli instability as a measure of magic and experimentally measure it on the IBM Eagle quantum processor. We prove that measuring large (i.e., extensive) quantities of magic is intractable. Our results suggest that one may only measure magic when a quantum computer does not provide a speed-up. We support our conclusions with both theoretical and experimental evidence. Our work illustrates the capabilities and limitations of quantum technology in measuring one of the most important resources in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Wigner-negative states in the steady-state emission of a two-level system driven by squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagating modes of light with negative-valued Wigner distributions are of fundamental interest in quantum optics and represent a key resource in the pursuit of optics-based quantum information technologies. Most schemes proposed or implemented for the generation of such modes are probabilistic in nature and rely on heralding by detection of a photon or on conditional methods where photons are separated from the original field mode by a beam splitter. In this Letter we demonstrate theoretically, using a cascaded-quantum-systems model, the possibility of deterministic generation of Wigner-negativity in temporal modes of the steady-state emission of a two-level system driven by finite-bandwidth quadrature-squeezed light. Optimal negativity is obtained for a squeezing bandwidth similar to the linewidth of the transition of the two-level system. While the Wigner distribution associated with the incident squeezed light is Gaussian and everywhere positive, the Wigner functions of the outgoing temporal modes show distinct similarities and overlap with a superposition of displaced squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Privacy in networks of quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We treat privacy in a network of quantum sensors where accessible information is limited to specific functions of the network parameters, and all other information remains private. We develop an analysis of privacy in terms of a manipulation of the quantum Fisher information matrix, and find the optimal state achieving maximum privacy in the estimation of linear combination of the unknown parameters in a network of quantum sensors. We also discuss the effect of uncorrelated noise on the privacy of the network. Moreover, we illustrate our results with an example where the goal is to estimate the average value of the unknown parameters in the network. In this example, we also introduce the notion of quasi-privacy ($\epsilon$-privacy), quantifying how close the state is to being private.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lotka-Volterra dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems that display competitive non-linear dynamics have played a key role in the development of mathematical models of Nature. Important examples include predator-prey models in ecology, biology, consumer-resource models in economics, and reaction-diffusion equations in chemical reactions. However, as real world systems are embedded in complex environments, where it is difficult or even impossible to control external parameters, quantitative comparison between measurements and simple models remains challenging. This motivates the search for competitive dynamics in isolated physical systems, with precise control. An ideal candidate is laser excitation in dilute atomic ensembles. For example, atoms in highly-excited Rydberg states display rich many-body dynamics including ergodicity breaking, synchronisation and time crystals. Here, we demonstrate predator-prey dynamics by laser excitation and ionisation of Rydberg atoms in a room temperature vapour cell. Ionisation of excited atoms produce electric fields that suppress further excitation. This starves the ionisation process of resource, giving rise to predator-prey dynamics. By comparing our results to the Lotka-Volterra model, we demonstrate that as well applications in non-linear dynamics, our experiment has applications in metrology, and remote sensing of localised plasmas.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements of the anti-Stokes scattered optical field. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: A Theoretical Framework for Enhancing or Enabling Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes Interaction and Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and enable cooling via the Stokes interaction. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous measurement-induced dynamics contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, contrary to the common paradigm of heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv preprint arXiv:0000.00000 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Impact of polarization mode dispersion on entangled photon distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers poses a major challenge for maintaining the fidelity of quantum states for quantum communications. In this work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement errors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental measurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our research proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband entangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The model provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of commercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber optic lines.</description>

      <title>Weak force sensing based on optical parametric amplification in a cavity optomechanical system coupled in series with two oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm weak force sensing, an important issue is to suppress fundamental noise (quantum noise and thermal noise), as they limit the accuracy of force measurement. In this paper, we investigate a weak force sensing scheme that combines a degenerate optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and an auxiliary mechanical oscillator into a cavity optomechanical system to reduce quantum noise. We demonstrate that the noise reduction of two coupled oscillators depends on their norm mode splitting. and provide a classic analogy and quantum perspective for further clarification. Besides, the noise reduction mechanism of OPA is to reduce the fluctuation of photon number and enhance the squeezing of the cavity field. We propose a specific design aimed at enhancing the joint effect of both, beyond what can be achieved using OPA alone or two series coupled oscillators. This scheme provides a new perspective for deeper understanding of cavity field squeezing and auxiliary oscillator in force sensing.</description>

      <title>Investigation on a quantum algorithm for linear differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ref.[BCOW17] introduced a pioneering quantum approach (coined BCOW algorithm) for solving linear differential equations with optimal error tolerance. Originally designed for a specific class of diagonalizable linear differential equations, the algorithm was extended by Krovi in [Kro23] to encompass broader classes, including non-diagonalizable and even singular matrices. Despite the common misconception, the original algorithm is indeed applicable to non-diagonalizable matrices, with diagonalisation primarily serving for theoretical analyses to establish bounds on condition number and solution error. By leveraging basic estimates from [Kro23], we derive bounds comparable to those outlined in the Krovi algorithm, thereby reinstating the advantages of the BCOW approach. Furthermore, we extend the BCOW algorithm to address time-dependent linear differential equations by transforming non-autonomous systems into higher-dimensional autonomous ones, a technique also applicable for the Krovi algorithm.</description>

      <title>Transform Arbitrary Good Quantum LDPC Codes into Good Geometrically Local Codes in Any Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically local quantum codes, comprised of qubits and checks embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$ with local check operators, have been a subject of significant interest. A key challenge is identifying the optimal code construction that maximizes both dimension and distance. Recent advancements have produced several constructions, but these either depend on specific good quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes or are limited to three dimensions. In this work, we introduce a construction that can transform any good qLDPC code into an optimal geometrically local quantum code. Our approach hinges on a novel procedure that extracts a two-dimensional structure from an arbitrary three-term chain complex. We expect that this procedure will find broader applications in areas such as weight reduction and the geometric realization of chain complexes.</description>

      <title>Leading correction to the relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Dirac particles interacting with external fields, we use the exact operator of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation obtained by Eriksen and rigorously derive a leading correction in the weak-field approximation to the known relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we carry out the operator extraction of a square root in the Eriksen operator. The derived correction is important for the scattering of relativistic particles. Since the description of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second order is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativisic wave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the relativisic wave equation of the second order is obtained with the correction similar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Cooperative emission from two coupled solid-state quantum emitters and its effect on random number generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the behaviour cooperative effects in the emitted light from a system of two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers confined in a nanopillar having dimensions close to the wavelength of the excitation pump. We experimentally observe a $g^{(2)}(0) &gt; 0.5 \to 1$ for the coupled emitter system and a drastic decrease in the singlet and triplet lifetimes by a factor of $\approx 6$, indicating an interaction between the two emitters, which indicates superradiant behaviour. We theoretically study the dissipative dynamics of the interaction of the emitter system with the excitation light at a finite temperature for three cases (single emitter, two emitters with and without dipole-dipole coupling) by solving the Lindblad master equation and providing an analytical expression for the second-order correlation function. We observe that from the master equation, the populations and coherences mix for the two emitters' cases. Through this, we support our experimental results and discuss superradiance from our system. Finally, we discover a reliable quantum random number generation rate of $\sim 200$ kHz from the coupled emitter system, at low pump powers.</description>

      <title>Efficient nuclear spin - photon entanglement with optical routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks and distributed quantum computers rely on entanglement generation between photons and long-lived quantum memories. For large-scale architectures, one of the most crucial parameters is the efficiency at which entanglement can be created and detected. Here, we maximize the efficiency for the detection of hybrid entanglement between a nuclear spin qubit in diamond with a photonic time-bin qubit. Our approach relies on an optimal implementation of the photonic qubit analyzer, for which we use a high-speed electro-optic deflector to direct photons deterministically along the optimal interferometer paths. This way, we completely eliminate all cases in which photons are randomly lost due to the propagation in the wrong interferometer path. In this first demonstration experiment, we use nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, for which we immediately demonstrate the presence of the entanglement. An extension to other spin-photon entanglement systems is straightforward. Further, our scheme can be used in the framework of quantum repeater networks, including spectral and temporal multiplexing strategies. Our results thus pave the way for the future high-performance quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for the variational optimization of correlated electronic states with stochastic reconfiguration and the linear method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the electronic Schrodinger equation for strongly correlated ground states is a long-standing challenge. We present quantum algorithms for the variational optimization of wavefunctions correlated by products of unitary operators, such as Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) ansatzes, using stochastic reconfiguration and the linear method. While an implementation on classical computing hardware would require exponentially growing compute cost, the cost (number of circuits and shots) of our quantum algorithms is polynomial in system size. We find that classical simulations of optimization with the linear method consistently find lower energy solutions than with the L-BFGS-B optimizer across the dissociation curves of the notoriously difficult N$_2$ and C$_2$ dimers; LUCJ predictions of the ground-state energies deviate from exact diagonalization by 1 kcal/mol or less at all points on the potential energy curve. While we do characterize the effect of shot noise on the LM optimization, these noiseless results highlight the critical but often overlooked role that optimization techniques must play in attacking the electronic structure problem (on both classical and quantum hardware), for which even mean-field optimization is formally NP hard. We also discuss the challenge of obtaining smooth curves in these strongly correlated regimes, and propose a number of quantum-friendly solutions ranging from symmetry-projected ansatz forms to a symmetry-constrained optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Exploring strong locality : Quantum state discrimination regime and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the conviction of switching information from locally accessible to locally hidden environs, the concept of hidden nonlocality activation has been recently highlighted by Bandyopadhyay et al. in [Phys. Rev. A 104, L050201 (2021)]. They demonstrate that a certain locally distinguishable set of pure quantum states can be transformed into an indistinguishable set with certainty by allowing local operations and classical communication(LOCC). As this transformation makes the set locally inaccessible to every subsystem, it is defined as the activation of genuine hidden nonlocality. In this paper, we observe that one class exhibits the previously mentioned nonlocal characteristics, harnessing local operation by a single party, while in contrast, another class demands cooperative endeavors among multiple local observers to reveal its nonlocal attributes. From this vantage point, we discern a stronger manifestation of locality, asserting that the latter class is inherently more local than the former. This analysis sheds light on the nuanced interplay between local and nonlocal phenomena within the framework of quantum state discrimination. Furthermore, we also explore their significant applications in the context of locally hiding information. Additionally, we introduce the concept of \emph{``strong local"} set and examine its comparison with different activable sets in terms of locality.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with non-commuting coupling operators: An analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic approach to treat open quantum systems strongly coupled to multiple environments via noncommuting system operators, a prime example is a qubit concurrently coupled to both decoherring and dissipative baths. Our approach, which accommodates strong system-bath couplings, generalizes the recently developed reaction-coordinate polaron transform method [PRX Quantum ${\bf 4}$, 020307 (2023)] to handle couplings to baths via noncommuting system operators. This approach creates an effective Hamiltonian that reveals the cooperative effect of the baths on the system. For a spin impurity coupled to both dissipative and decoherring environments, the effective Hamiltonian predicts the suppression of relaxation by decoherence -- a phenomenon previously observed in simulations but lacking a theoretical foundation. We also apply the method to an ensemble of spins coupled to local baths through noncommuting operators, demonstrating the engineering of the Kitaev XY spin chain interaction. Noncommutativity is a feature of quantum systems; future prospects of our approach include the study of thermal machines that leverage such genuine quantum effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise and thermal noise are the two primary sources of noise that limit the sensitivity of weak magnetic field sensing. Although quantum noise has been widely addressed, effectively reducing thermal noise remains challenging in detecting weak magnetic fields. We employ an anisotropic elliptical YIG sphere as a magnetic field probe to establish a parametric amplification interaction of magnons and induce magnon squeezing effects. These effects can effectively suppress thermal noise in the magnon mode and amplify weak magnetic field signals from external sources. Specifically, complete suppression of thermal noise can be achieved by placing the YIG sphere in a squeezed vacuum reservoir. Our scheme has the potential to inspire advancements in thermal noise suppression for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>High ground state overlap via quantum embedding methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can accurately compute ground state energies using phase estimation, but this requires a guiding state which has significant overlap with the true ground state.For large molecules and extended materials, it becomes difficult to find guiding states with good ground state overlap for growing molecule sizes. Additionally, the required number of qubits and quantum gates may become prohibitively large. One approach for dealing with these challenges is to use a quantum embedding method, which allows a reduction to one or multiple smaller quantum cores embedded in a larger quantum region. In such situations it is unclear how the embedding method affects the hardness of constructing good guiding states. In this work, we therefore investigate the preparation of guiding states in the context of quantum embedding methods. We extend previous work on quantum impurity problems, a framework in which we can rigorously analyze the embedding of a subset of orbitals. While there exist results for optimal active orbital space selection in terms of energy minimization, we rigorously demonstrate how the same principles can be used to define selected orbital spaces for state preparation in terms of the overlap with the ground state. Moreover, we perform numerical studies of molecular systems relevant to biochemistry, one field in which quantum embedding methods are required due to the large size of biomacromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. We investigate two different embedding strategies which can exhibit qualitatively different orbital entanglement. In all cases we demonstrate that the easy-to-obtain mean-field state will have a sufficiently high overlap with the target state to perform quantum phase estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have proven to be effective in simulating many quantum systems. Simulating nuclear processes and state preparation poses significant challenges, even for traditional supercomputers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a complete simulation of a nuclear transition, including the preparation of both ground and first excited states. To tackle the complexity of strong interactions between two and three nucleons, the states are modeled on the tritium nucleus. Both the initial and final states are represented using quantum circuits with variational quantum algorithms and inductive biases. Describing the spin-isospin states requires four qubits, and a parameterized quantum circuit that exploits a total of 16 parameters is initialized. The estimated energy has a relative error of approximately 2% for the ground state and about 10% for the first excited state of the system. The quantum computer simulation estimates the transition probability between the two states as a function of the dipole polarization angle. This work marks a first step towards leveraging digital quantum computers to simulate nuclear physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth ion doped crystals are state-of-the-art platforms for processing quantum information, particularly thanks to their excellent optical and spin coherence properties at cryogenic temperatures. Experimental observations have shown that the application of a static magnetic bias field significantly improves the coherence times in the rare-earth ions ensemble, but only a few studies have focused on its the dependency as a function of both magnetic field direction and amplitude. This is especially true for magnetic field amplitudes under the mT, and for low magnetic dipole moment ions. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the magnetic field parameters and the decoherence caused by magnetic dipole-dipole coupling with the nearest neighbors nuclear spins in the crystal. The primary non-Kramers rare-earth ions investigated here are europium and praseodymium, but we also extend our study to the ytterbium Kramers ion due to its low magnetic dipole in the mT range. We perform theoretical investigations and simulations of the energy structure and coherence time evolution and identify good correspondences between experimental and simulated spin echo data. This work allows us to pinpoint the most relevant decoherence mechanisms in the considered magnetic field regime, and to predict favorable magnetic configurations.</description>

      <title>Measurement Induced Magic Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic states and magic gates are crucial for achieving universal computation, but some important questions about how magic resources should be implemented to attain quantum advantage have remained unexplored, for instance, in the context of Measurement-based Quantum Computation (MQC) with only single-qubit measurements. This work bridges the gap between MQC and the resource theory of magic by introducing the concept of ``invested'' and ``potential" magic resources. The former quantifies the magic cost associated with the MQC framework, serving both as a witness of magic resources and an upper bound for the realization of a desired unitary transformation. Potential magic resources represent the maximum achievable magic resource in a given graph structure defining the MQC. We utilize these concepts to analyze the magic resource requirements of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and provide a fresh perspective on the universality of MQC of different resource states, highlighting the crucial role of non-Pauli measurements for injecting magic. We demonstrate experimentally our theoretical predictions in a high-fidelity four-photon setup and demonstrate the efficiency of MQC in generating magic states, surpassing the limitations of conventional magic state injection methods. Our findings pave the way for future research exploring magic resource optimization and novel distillation schemes within the MQC framework, contributing to the advancement of fault-tolerant universal quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics, providing a means of understanding the behavior of quantum systems under a range of potential energies. In particular, over the past decade, theoretical studies have focused on adapting the Dunkl derivative to quantum mechanical problems. This approach merely seeks to generalize traditional quantum mechanical techniques through the utilization of differential-difference operators associated with finite reflection groups, thereby providing solutions that are dependent on parity. In this manuscript, we investigate the analytical solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a harmonic oscillator with time-dependent mass and frequency, coupled with angular-dependent potential energy by utilizing the Dunkl derivatives. To obtain the solution, we employ the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant methodology. Our approach broadens the scope of quantum mechanical analyses, offering exact solutions and new insights into dynamic quantum systems under varying conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a Bayesian agent-based framework inspired by QBism to iterations of two quantum games, the CHSH game and the quantum prisoners' dilemma. In each two-player game, players hold beliefs about an amount of shared entanglement and about the actions or beliefs of the other player. Each takes actions which maximize their expected utility and revises their beliefs with the classical Bayes rule between rounds. We simulate iterated play to see if and how players can learn about the presence of shared entanglement and to explore how their performance, their beliefs, and the game's structure interrelate. In the CHSH game, we find that players can learn that entanglement is present and use this to achieve quantum advantage. We find that they can only do so if they also believe the other player will act correctly to exploit the entanglement. In the case of low or zero entanglement in the CHSH game, the players cannot achieve quantum advantage, even in the case where they believe the entanglement is higher than it is. For the prisoners dilemma, we show that assuming 1-fold rational players (rational players who believe the other player is also rational) reduces the quantum extension [Eisert, Wilkens, and Lewenstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3077 (1999)] of the prisoners dilemma to a game with only two strategies, one of which (defect) is dominant for low entanglement, and the other (the quantum strategy Q) is dominant for high entanglement. For intermediate entanglement, neither strategy is dominant. We again show that players can learn entanglement in iterated play. We also show that strong belief in entanglement causes optimal play even in the absence of entanglement -- showing that belief in entanglement is acting as a proxy for the players trusting each other. Our work points to possible future applications in resource detection and quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a one-way, one-quantum cascade, whereby a single excitation proceeds one-directionwise in a ladder of energy levels. This makes a variation from more famous two-way cascades where the excitation can go up and down following its excitation or relaxation in the ladder. We provide closed-form solutions for two-photon correlation functions between any transitions in such circular cascades. We discuss how the rich correlations that result from what appears to be an extremely simple implementation, are essentially those which have been entertained from complex architectures relying on strongly-correlated, many-body physics or cavity QED effects.</description>

      <title>Using Detector Likelihood for Benchmarking Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of real quantum hardware differs strongly from the simple error models typically used when simulating quantum error correction. Error processes are far more complex than simple depolarizing noise applied to single gates, and error rates can vary greatly between different qubits, and at different points in the circuit. Nevertheless, it would be useful to distill all this complicated behavior down to a single parameter: an effective error rate for a simple uniform error model. Here we show that this can be done by means of the average detector likelihood, which quantifies the rate at which error detection events occur. We show that this parameter is predictive of the overall code performance for two variants of the surface code: Floquet codes and the 3-CX surface code. This is then used to define an effective error rate at which simulations for a simple uniform noise model result in the same average detector likelihood, as well as a good prediction of the logical error rate.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature optical spin polarization of an electron spin qudit in a vanadyl -- free base porphyrin dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoexcited organic chromophores appended to molecular qubits can serve as a source of spin initialization or multi-level qudit generation for quantum information applications. So far, this approach has been primarily investigated in chromophore/stable radical systems. Here, we extend this concept to a meso-meso linked oxovanadium(IV) porphyrin - free base porphyrin dimer. Femtosecond transient absorption experiments reveal that photoexcitation of the free base porphyrin leads to picosecond triplet state formation via enhanced intersystem crossing. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) experiments carried out at both 85 K and room temperature reveal the formation of a long-lived spin-polarized quartet state through triplet-doublet spin mixing. Notably, a distinct hyperfine structure arising from the interaction between the electron spin quartet state and the vanadyl nucleus (51V, I=7/2) is evident, with the quartet state exhibiting long-lived spin polarization even at room temperature. Theoretical simulations of the TREPR spectra confirm the photogenerated quartet state and provide insights into the non-Boltzmann spin populations. Exploit-ing this phenomenon affords the possibility of using photoinduced triplet states in porphyrins for quantum information as a resource to polarize and magnetically couple molecular electronic or nuclear spin qubits and qudits.</description>

      <title>Exponential tail estimates for quantum lattice dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a particle on a lattice for large times. Assuming translation invariance, and either discrete or continuous time parameter, the distribution of the ballistically scaled position $Q(t)/t$ converges weakly to a distribution that is compactly supported in velocity space, essentially the distribution of group velocity in the initial state. We show that the total probability of velocities strictly outside the support of the asymptotic measure goes to zero exponentially with $t$, and we provide a simple method to estimate the exponential rate uniformly in the initial state. Near the boundary of the allowed region the rate function goes to zero like the power 3/2 of the distance to the boundary. The method is illustrated in several examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum conditional entropies and fully entangled fraction of states with maximally mixed marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fully entangled fraction (FEF) measures the proximity of a quantum state to maximally entangled states. FEF $&gt;\frac{1}{d}$, in $d \otimes d$ systems is a significant benchmark for various quantum information processing protocols including teleportation. Quantum conditional entropy (QCE) on the other hand is a measure of correlation in quantum systems. Conditional entropies for quantum systems can be negative, marking a departure from conventional classical systems. The negativity of quantum conditional entropies plays a decisive role in tasks like state merging and dense coding. In the present work, we investigate the relation of these two important yardsticks. Our probe is mainly done in the ambit of states with maximally mixed marginals, with a few illustrations from other classes of quantum states. We start our study in two qubit systems, where for the Werner states, we obtain lower bounds to its FEF when the conditional R\'enyi $\alpha-$entropy is negative. We then obtain relations between FEF and QCE for two qubit Weyl states. Moving on to two qudit states we find a necessary and sufficient condition based on FEF, for the isotropic state to have negative conditional entropy. In two qudit systems the relation between FEF and QCE is probed for the rank deficient and generalized Bell diagonal states. FEF is intricately linked with $k$- copy nonlocality and $k$- copy steerability. The relations between FEF and QCE facilitates to find conditions for $k$- copy nonlocality and $k$- copy steerability based on QCE. We obtain such conditions for certain classes of states in two qubits and two qudits. As a corollary to the relations obtained between QCE and FEF we obtain lower bounds to minimal deterministic work cost for two qubit Werner states and two qudit generalized Bell states.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum hypothesis testing via the interplay between coherent evolution and noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies in quantum information have recognized that specific types of noise can encode information in certain applications. However, the role of noise in Quantum Hypothesis Testing (QHT), traditionally assumed to undermine performance and reduce success probability, has not been thoroughly explored. Our study bridges this gap by establishing sufficient conditions for noisy dynamics that can surpass the success probabilities achievable under noiseless (unitary) dynamics within certain time intervals. We then devise and experimentally implement a noise-assisted QHT protocol in the setting of ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance spin systems. Our experimental results demonstrate that the success probability of QHT under the noisy dynamics can indeed surpass the ceiling set by unitary evolution alone. Moreover, we have shown that in cases where noise initially hampers the performance, strategic application of coherent controls on the system can transform these previously detrimental noises into advantageous factors. This transformative approach demonstrates the potential to harness and leverage noise in QHT, which pushes the boundaries of QHT and general quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Approximating under the Influence of Quantum Noise and Compute Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimisation algorithm (QAOA) is at the core of many scenarios that aim to combine the power of quantum computers and classical high-performance computing appliances for combinatorial optimisation. Several obstacles challenge concrete benefits now and in the foreseeable future: Imperfections quickly degrade algorithmic performance below practical utility; overheads arising from alternating between classical and quantum primitives can counter any advantage; and the choice of parameters or algorithmic variant can substantially influence runtime and result quality. Selecting the optimal combination is a non-trivial issue, as it not only depends on user requirements, but also on details of the hardware and software stack. Appropriate automation can lift the burden of choosing optimal combinations for end-users: They should not be required to understand technicalities like differences between QAOA variants, required number of QAOA layers, or necessary measurement samples. Yet, they should receive best-possible satisfaction of their non-functional requirements, be it performance or other. We determine factors that affect solution quality and temporal behaviour of four QAOA variants using comprehensive density-matrix-based simulations targeting three widely studied optimisation problems. Our simulations consider ideal quantum computation, and a continuum of scenarios troubled by realistic imperfections. Our quantitative results, accompanied by a comprehensive reproduction package, show strong differences between QAOA variants that can be pinpointed to narrow and specific effects. We identify influential co-variables and relevant non-functional quality goals that, we argue, mark the relevant ingredients for designing appropriate software engineering abstraction mechanisms and automated tool-chains for devising quantum solutions from high-level problem specifications.</description>

      <title>Realizing mechanical dynamical Casimir effect with low-frequency oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize the mechanical dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in a hybrid optomechanical system consisting of a cavity mode, a low-frequency mechanical oscillator, and a two-level atomic system. Described by the effective Hamiltonian, the mechanical energy is found to be directly converted into the output photons through a three-wave-mixing mechanism. It is dramatically distinct from the quantum simulation of a parametric DCE in such as superconducting circuits. Using a master-equation approach, we analyze the system dynamics in various regimes with respect to the ratio of the effective coupling strength and the loss rate of the system. The dynamics under the strong-coupling regime confirms various three-wave-mixing process for creating photons by annihilation of the mechanical and atomic excitations. And that under the weak-coupling regime demonstrates the continuous production of photons by driving both mechanical oscillator and atom. By virtue of the two-level system, our method avoids the rigorous requirement for the high-frequency mechanical oscillator, that was demanded in standard DCE under the double-photon resonance. It is found that the mechanical frequency can be about two orders of magnitude smaller than the output photons.</description>

      <title>Quantum Clustering for Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a novel quantum machine learning (QML) framework to analyze cybersecurity vulnerabilities using data from the 2022 CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, which includes detailed information on vulnerability types, severity levels, common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) scores, and product specifics. Our framework preprocesses this data into a quantum-compatible format, enabling clustering analysis through our advanced quantum techniques, QCSWAPK-means and QkernelK-means. These quantum algorithms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art classical clustering techniques like k-means and spectral clustering, achieving Silhouette scores of 0.491, Davies-Bouldin indices below 0.745, and Calinski-Harabasz scores exceeding 884, indicating more distinct and well-separated clusters. Our framework categorizes vulnerabilities into distinct groups, reflecting varying levels of risk severity: Cluster 0, primarily consisting of critical Microsoft-related vulnerabilities; Cluster 1, featuring medium severity vulnerabilities from various enterprise software vendors and network solutions; Cluster 2, with high severity vulnerabilities from Adobe, Cisco, and Google; and Cluster 3, encompassing vulnerabilities from Microsoft and Oracle with high to medium severity. These findings highlight the potential of QML to enhance the precision of vulnerability assessments and prioritization, advancing cybersecurity practices by enabling more strategic and proactive defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Pulse Waveforms for Qubit Gates using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to optimise the parameters of pulse waveforms used for manipulating qubit states, resulting in high fidelity implementation of qubit gates. High fidelity quantum simulations are crucial for scaling up current quantum computers. The proposed approach uses DNNs to model the functional relationship between amplitudes of pulse waveforms used in scheduling and the corresponding fidelities. The DNNs are trained using a dataset of amplitude and corresponding fidelities obtained through quantum simulations in Qiskit. A two-stage approach is used with the trained DNNs to obtain amplitudes that yield the highest fidelity. The proposed method is evaluated by estimating the amplitude for pulse scheduling of single (Hadamard and Pauli-X) and two qubit gates (CNOT). The results clearly indicate that the method can achieve high fidelity implementations of single-qubit gates with fidelities of 0.999976 and 0.999923 for Hadamard and Pauli-X gates, respectively. For the CNOT gate, the best fidelity obtained is 0.695313. This can be attributed to the effects of entanglement and the need for the phase parameter to be accounted for within the predictive model.</description>

      <title>A Novel Stabilizer-based Entanglement Distillation Protocol for Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation, the process of converting weakly entangled states into maximally entangled ones using Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC), is pivotal for robust entanglement-assisted quantum information processing in error-prone environments. A construction based on stabilizer codes offers an effective method for designing such protocols. By analytically investigating the effective action of stabilizer protocols for codes in arbitrary dimensions, we establish a standard form for the output states of recurrent stabilizer-based distillation. This links the properties of input states, stabilizers, and encodings to the properties of the protocol. Based on those insights, we present a novel two-copy distillation protocol, applicable to all bipartite states, that maximizes the fidelity increase per iteration for Bell-diagonal states in any prime dimension. The power of this framework and the protocol is demonstrated through numerical investigations, which provide evidence of its superior performance in terms of efficiency and distillability of low-fidelity states compared to other well-established recurrence protocols. By elucidating the interplay between states, errors, and protocols, our contribution advances the systematic development of highly effective distillation protocols across arbitrary dimensions, enhancing our understanding of distillability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovative solutions and developments are being inspected to tackle rising electrical power demand to be supplied by clean forms of energy. The integration of renewable energy generations, varying nature loads, importance of active role of distribution system and consumer participation in grid operation has changed the landscape of classical power grids. Implementation of smarter applications to plan, monitor, operate the grid safely are deemed paramount for efficient, secure and reliable functioning of grid. Although sophisticated computations to process gigantic volume of data to produce useful information in a time critical manner is the paradigm of future grid operations, it brings along the burden of computational complexity. Advancements in quantum technologies holds promising solution for dealing with demanding computational complexity of power system related applications. In this article, we lay out clear motivations for seeking quantum solutions for solving computational burden challenges associated with power system applications. Next we present an overview of quantum solutions for various power system related applications available in current literature and suggest future topics for research. We further highlight challenges with existing quantum solutions for exploiting full quantum capabilities. Additionally, this paper serves as a bridge for power engineers to the quantum world by outlining essential quantum computation fundamentals for enabling smoother transition to future of power system computations.</description>

      <title>On Interstellar Quantum Communication and the Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since it began \cite{CocconiMorrison}, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has focused on interstellar \emph{classical} communication. Recently, Berera \cite{Berera:2020rpl} pointed out that, at certain frequencies, photon qubits can retain their quantum coherence over interstellar (and even intergalactic) distances, raising the prospect of interstellar \emph{quantum} communication. This is an intriguing possibility, since quantum communication permits certain tasks that would be impossible with classical communication, and allow exponential speed-ups for others. (We suggest some motivations in the interstellar context.) But quantum coherence alone is not sufficient for quantum communication: here, for the first time, we analyze the \emph{quantum capacity} $Q$ of an interstellar channel. We point out that, to have non-zero quantum capacity $Q&gt;0$, interstellar communication over a distance $L$ must use wavelengths $\lambda &lt; 26.5\,cm$ (to avoid depolarization by the cosmic microwave background), and \emph{enormous} telescopes of effective diameter $D&gt;0.78\sqrt{\lambda L}$ (to satisfy quantum erasure constraints). For example, for two telescopes of diameter $D$ on Earth and Proxima Centauri, this implies $D&gt;100\,km$! This is a technological threshold that remains to be crossed in order for reliable one-way quantum communication to become possible, and suggests a fundamental new resolution of the Fermi paradox.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phases of a BEC in a bad optical cavity at optomechanical resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of dynamical phases of a Bose-Einstein condensate that is optomechanically coupled to a dissipative cavity mode and transversally driven by a laser. We focus on the regime close to the optomechanical resonance, where the atoms' refractive index shifts the cavity into resonance, assuming fast cavity relaxation. We derive an effective model for the atomic motion, where the cavity degrees of freedom are eliminated using perturbation theory in the atom-cavity coupling and benchmark its predictions using numerical simulations based on the full model. Away from the optomechanical resonance, perturbation theory in the lowest order (adiabatic elimination) reliably describes the dynamics and predicts chaotic phases with unstable oscillations. Interestingly, the dynamics close to the optomechanical resonance are qualitatively captured only by including the corrections to next order (non-adiabatic corrections). In this regime we find limit cycle phases that describe stable oscillations of the density with a well defined frequency. We further show that such limit cycle solutions are metastable configurations of the adiabatic model. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms that are required to observe dynamical phases and predict their existence in atom-cavity systems where a substantial timescale separation is present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization and exploitation of multiple channels between the transmitter and the receiver in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications brought a paradigm shift in classical communication systems. The techniques developed around MIMO communication systems not only brought unprecedented advancements in the communication rates but also substantially improved the reliability of communication, measured by low error rates. Here, we explore the same ideas in the paradigm of quantum MIMO communication. Specifically, we utilize approximate quantum cloning to transmit multiple copies of the same quantum state over a MIMO channel that incorporates crosstalk, losses, and depolarizing noise. With this strategy, we find an achievable tradeoff between the average fidelity and communication rate over this MIMO setup.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional classical communication cost of a bipartite quantum channel assisted by non-signalling correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the classical communication cost of simulating a quantum channel is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory, which becomes even more intriguing when considering the role of non-locality in quantum information processing. This paper investigates the bidirectional classical communication cost of simulating a bipartite quantum channel assisted by non-signalling correlations. Such non-signalling correlations are permitted not only across spatial dimension between the two parties but also along the temporal dimension of the channel simulation protocol. By introducing non-signalling superchannels, we derive semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations for the one-shot exact bidirectional classical communication cost via non-signalling bipartite superchannels. We further introduce a channel's bipartite conditional min-entropy as an efficiently computable lower bound on the asymptotic cost of bidirectional classical communication. Our results in both one-shot and asymptotic settings provide lower bounds on the entanglement-assisted simulation cost in scenarios where entanglement is available to the two parties and can be utilized across the timeline of the protocol. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in estimating communication costs for various quantum channels, showing that our bounds can be tight in different scenarios. Our results elucidate the role of non-locality in quantum communication and pave the way for exploring quantum reverse Shannon theory in bipartite scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin (qubit) is in contact with a bosonic reservoir. The state of the reservoir contains a parameter {\varepsilon} interpolating between quantum and classical reservoir features. We derive the explicit expression for the time-dependent reduced spin density matrix, valid for all values of {\varepsilon} and for energy conserving interactions. We study decoherence and markovianity properties. Our main finding is that the spin decoherence is enhanced (full decoherence) when the spin is coupled to quantum reservoir states while it is dampened (partial decoherence) when coupled to classical reservoir states. The markovianity properties depend in a subtle way on the classicality parameter {\varepsilon} and on the finer details of the spin-reservoir interaction. We further examine scattering and periodicity properties for energy exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Quantum Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected photons spatially transfers amplitude and phase information from one spectral region of physical interest to another spectral region that is easy to detect. The photon energy of the two spectral regions can, in principle, be separated by several orders of magnitude. However, quantum imaging with undetected photons has so far only been demonstrated in spectral regions of similar order of magnitude in frequency (and for which cameras are commercially available). Here, we demonstrate amplitude- and phase-sensitive imaging in the terahertz spectral region (1.5 THz center frequency) by detecting only visible photons (center wavelength 662.2 nm, 452.7 THz center frequency) more than two orders of magnitude apart. As a result, terahertz spectral information can be reliably detected with a standard CMOS camera without cooling, achieving a spatial resolution close to the wavelength. By taking advantage of quantum distillation in a nonlinear interferometer, the influence of ubiquitous thermal terahertz photons can be neglected. Our results are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the imaging process and demonstrate the huge potential of this method to address otherwise challenging spectral regions where cameras do not exist.</description>

      <title>High Purcell-enhancement in quantum-dot hybrid circular Bragg grating cavities for GHz-clockrate generation of indistinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Purcell-enhanced ($F_\mathrm{P} &gt; 25$) semiconductor InAs quantum dot radiative lifetimes of $T_1 &lt; 30~\mathrm{ps}$, enabled by deterministic hybrid circular Bragg gratings (hCBGs). We investigate the benefits of these short T1 times on the two-photon indistinguishability for quasi-resonant and strictly resonant excitation, and observe visibilities $\geq96\%$ at 12.5 ns time delay of consecutively emitted photons. The strongly Purcell-enhanced decay times enable a high degree of indistinguishability for elevated temperatures of up to 30 K, and moreover, allow for excitation of up to 1.28 GHz repetition rate. Our work highlights the prospects of high Purcell enhanced solid-state quantum emitters for applications in quantum information and technologies operating at GHz clock-rates.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative optimization problems with differential constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO) problems seek to minimize the state average of a polynomial of some operator variables, subject to polynomial constraints, over all states and operators, as well as the Hilbert spaces where those might be defined. Many of these problems are known to admit a complete hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. NPO theory has found application in quantum information theory, quantum chemistry and statistical physics. In this work, we consider a variant of NPO problems where a subset of the operator variables satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations. We find that, under mild conditions of operator boundedness, for every such problem one can construct a standard NPO problem with the same solution. This allows us to define a complete hierarchy of SDPs to tackle the original differential problem. We apply this method to extrapolate quantum time series in a semi-device-independent way and sketch how one can use it to model Hamiltonian time evolution in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Requirements for Industry Relevant Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use open-source tools to perform quantum resource estimation to assess the requirements for industry-relevant quantum computation. Our analysis uses the problem of industrial shift scheduling in manufacturing and the Quantum Industrial Shift Scheduling algorithm. We base our figures of merit on current technology, as well as theoretical high-fidelity scenarios for superconducting qubit platforms. We find that the execution time of gate and measurement operations determines the overall computational runtime more strongly than the system error rates. Moreover, achieving a quantum speedup would not only require low system error rates ($10^{-6}$ or better), but also measurement operations with an execution time below 10ns. This rules out the possibility of near-term quantum advantage for this use case, and suggests that significant technological or algorithmic progress will be needed before such an advantage can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Quantum information theory on sparse wavefunctions and applications for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years Quantum Computing prominently entered in the field of Computational Chemistry, importing and transforming computational methods and ideas originally developed within other disciplines, such as Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science into algorithms able to estimate quantum properties of atoms and molecules on present and future quantum devices. An important role in this contamination process is attributed to Quantum Information techniques, having the twofold role of contributing to the analysis of electron correlation and entanglements and guiding the construction of wavefunction variational ansatzes for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver technique.
  This paper introduces the tool SparQ (Sparse Quantum state analysis), designed to efficiently compute fundamental quantum information theory observables on post-Hartree-Fock wavefunctions sparse in their definition space. The core methodology involves mapping fermionic wavefunctions to qubit space using fermionic-to-qubits transformations and leveraging the sparse nature of these wavefunctions to evaluate observables and properties of the wavefunction.
  The effectiveness of SparQ is validated by analyzing the mutual information matrices of wavefunctions for the water molecule and the total entropy of $\sim 10^2$ qubits describing the benzene molecule. This highlights its capability to handle large-scale quantum systems, limited mainly by the capabilities of quantum chemical methods used to retrieve the wavefunctions. The results indicate that quantum information theoretical analysis, so far limited to traditional tensor network methods and study of transition operators, can be applied to all post-Hartree-Fock wavefunctions, extending their applications to larger and more complex chemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Quantum Target Ranging in the context of multi-hypothesis testing and its applicability to real-world LiDAR systems. First, we demonstrate that ranging is generally an easier task compared to the well-studied problem of target detection. We then analyze the theoretical bounds and advantages of quantum ranging in the context of phase-insensitive measurements, which is the operational mode of most LiDAR systems. Additionally, we adopt a background noise model more suited to optical frequencies, as opposed to the typical single-mode thermal noise model used in quantum target detection theory. Our findings indicate that a significant exponential quantum advantage can be achieved using simple photon-counting receivers across a broad range of parameters, thereby validating the efficacy of the quantum approach for LiDAR implementations.</description>

      <title>Compact Multi-Threshold Quantum Information Driven Ansatz For Strongly Interactive Lattice Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on the variational principle have found applications in diverse areas with a huge flexibility. But as the circuit size increases the variational landscapes become flattened, causing the so-called Barren plateau phenomena. This will lead to an increased difficulty in the optimization phase, due to the reduction of the cost function parameters gradient. One of the possible solutions is to employ shallower circuits or adaptive ans\"atze.
  We introduce a systematic procedure for ansatz building based on approximate Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) with improvement on each layer based on the previous Quantum Information Driven Ansatz (QIDA) approach. Our approach generates a layered-structured ansatz, where each layer's qubit pairs are selected based on their QMI values, resulting in more efficient state preparation and optimization routines. We benchmarked our approach on various configurations of the Heisenberg model Hamiltonian, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of the ground state energy calculations compared to traditional heuristic ansatz methods. Our results show that the Multi-QIDA method reduces the computational complexity while maintaining high precision, making it a promising tool for quantum simulations in lattice spin models.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy - the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits - within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using advanced numerical techniques based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling continuous work extraction (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Electrical excitation of color centers in phosphorus-doped diamond Schottky diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust quantum light source operating upon electrical injection at ambient conditions is desirable for practical implementation of quantum technologies, such as quantum key distribution or metrology. Color centers in diamond are promising candidates as they are photostable emitters at room and elevated temperatures. The possibility of their electrical excitation has already been demonstrated within p-i-n diodes. However, this requires the growth of complex diamond structures. In contrast to these conventional approaches, we demonstrate the emission of color centers under electrical pumping in a novel Schottky diode configuration based on hydrogen passivated n-type diamond, which holds promise for integrated single-photon emitting devices based on color centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>All-optical atomic magnetometry using an elliptically polarized amplitude-modulated light wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a resonant interaction of an elliptically polarized light wave with $^{87}$Rb vapor (D$_1$ line) exposed to a transverse magnetic field. A $5$$\times$$5$$\times$$5$~mm$^3$ glass vapor cell is used for the experiments. The wave intensity is modulated at the frequency $\Omega_m$. By scanning $\Omega_m$ near the Larmor frequency $\Omega_L$, a magnetic resonance (MR) can be observed as a change in the ellipticity parameter of the wave polarization. This method for observing MR allows to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio compared to a classical Bell-Bloom scheme using a circularly polarized wave. The sensitivity of the magnetic field sensor is estimated to be $\approx\,$$130$~fT/$\surd$Hz in a $2$~kHz bandwidth, confidently competing with widely used Faraday-rotation Bell-Bloom schemes. The results can be used to develop a miniature all-optical magnetic field sensor for medicine and geophysics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional spin systems. The XXZ model with disorder is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOMs), but assuming instead a logarithmic lightcone we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation of $ \alpha$-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0&lt; \alpha&lt;1 $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law. Assuming the existence of LIOMs we prove that the Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic lightcone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy, from a generic initial product state, has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid in a generalized Kitaev honeycomb model with $\mathbb{Z}_4$ 1-form symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a large $N$ generalization of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a simple nearest-neighbor interacting Hamiltonian. In particular, we focus on the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ case with isotropic couplings, which is characterized by an exact $\mathbb{Z}_4$ one-form symmetry. Guided by symmetry considerations and an analytical study in the single chain limit, on the infinitely long cylinders, we find the model is gapped with an extremely short correlation length. Combined with the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ one-form symmetry, this suggests the model is topologically ordered. To pin down the nature of this phase, we further study the model on both finite and infinitely long strips, where we consistently find a $c=1$ conformal field theory (CFT) description, suggesting the existence of chiral edge modes described by a free boson CFT. Further evidence is found by studying the dimer correlators on infinitely long strips. We find the dimer correlation functions show a power-law decay with the exponent close to 2 on the boundary of the strip, while decay much faster in the bulk. Combined with the topological entanglement entropy extracted from cylinder geometry, we identify the spin liquid is chiral and supports a $\mathrm{U}(1)_{-8}$ chiral topological order. A unified perspective for all $\mathbb{Z}_N$ type Kitaev models is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We generalize a semi-classical path integral approach originally introduced by Giachetti and Tognetti [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 912 (1985)] and Feynman and Kleinert [Phys. Rev. A 34, 5080 (1986)] to time-dependent Hamiltonians, thus extending the scope of the method to the pricing of financial derivatives. We illustrate the accuracy of the approach by presenting results for the well-known, but analytically intractable, Black-Karasinski model for the dynamics of interest rates. The accuracy and computational efficiency of this path integral approach makes it a viable alternative to fully-numerical schemes for a variety of applications in derivatives pricing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently with the bound saturating when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha n l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). % This phase may be equally realized with two quantum Ising spin chains coupled through a spin interaction along $z$ direction. In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trilobite molecules are ultralong-range Rydberg molecules formed when a high angular momentum Rydberg electron scatters off of a ground-state atom. Their unique electronic structure and highly oscillatory potential energy curves support a rich variety of dynamical effects yet to be explored. We analyze the vibrational motion of these molecules using a framework of adiabatic wavepacket propagation dynamics and observe that for appropriate initial states, the trilobite potential acts as molecular diffraction grating. The quantum dynamic effects observed are explained using a Fourier analysis of the scattering potential and the associated scattered wavepacket. Furthermore, vibrational ground-states of the low angular momentum ultralong-range Rydberg molecules are found to be particularly suitable to prepare the relevant wavepackets. Hence, we propose a time resolved pump-probe scheme designed for the realization of the effect in question, and advertise the utilization of a single diatomic Rydberg molecule as a testbed for the study of exaggerated quantum dynamical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) nonlinear nonperturbative response of the molecular system is studied for photoisomerization reaction. The 1,3-cyclohexadiene photoisomerization is probed by the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process induced by the ultrashort few femtosecond intense laser pulse. For each of the long-lived or stable isomers, we present results for HHG spectra and HHG ellipticities, as well as multi-photon ionization. Moreover, the laser-induced electronic excitations are calculated and the effect of excitations on HHG spectra is discussed. We describe the characteristic properties of the nonlinear response for each of the isomers that can be used for ultrafast detection of the isomers by tracking the specific changes in HHG response.</description>

      <title>How cosmological expansion affects communication between distant quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum communication protocol between harmonic oscillator detectors, interacting with a quantum field, is developed in a cosmological expanding background. The aim is to see if the quantum effects arising in an expanding universe, such as the cosmological particle production, could facilitate the communication between two distant parts or if they provide an additive noisy effect. By considering a perfect cosmic fluid, the resulting expansion turns out to increase the classical capacity of the protocol. This increasing occurs for all the cosmological expansions unless the latter is sharpened just before the receiver's detector interacts with the field. Moreover, the classical capacity turns out to be sensible to the barotropic parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid and to the coupling between the field and the scalar curvature $\xi$. As a consequence, by performing this protocol, one can achieve information about the cosmological dynamics and its coupling with a background quantum field.</description>

      <title>Strip-Loaded Nanophotonic Interfaces for Resonant Coupling and Single-Photon Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the design and simulation of strip-loaded nanophotonic interfaces aimed at improving resonant coupling and photon routing efficiency. In our design, the guided mode is confined within a plane by a high-index thin film and is loosely confined laterally by a lower index strip. Using a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) strip, titanium dioxide core, and silicon dioxide substrate, we optimise the waveguide dimensions for maximum lateral confinement of light. Specifically, we propose a polymer-based Bragg grating cavity and ring resonator that achieve near-optimal mode volumes and high Q-factors. Our simulations suggest that a cavity with a mode volume of V_{\text{eff}} \approx 7.0 \left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^3 and a Q-factor of 7000 can produce photons with 97% indistinguishability at 4K. Additionally, we investigate directional couplers for efficient photon routing, comparing photonic and plasmonic material structures. While pure photonic structures demonstrate lower loss and improved quality factors, they face practical limitations in terms of bending radius. Conversely, plasmonic structures offer shorter bending radii but higher propagation losses. This research lays the groundwork for future nanophotonic designs, aiming to enhance photon generation and routing capabilities for quantum optical applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Relativistic Vortex Electrons in External Laser Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating vortex electron interactions with electromagnetic fields is essential for advancing particle acceleration techniques, scattering theory in background fields, and obtaining novel electron beams for material diagnostics. A systematic investigation into the dynamics of vortex electrons in external laser fields and the exploration of laser-induced vortex modes remains lacking. In this work, we study the propagation of vortex electrons in linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses, both separately and in their combined form in two-mode laser pulses. The theoretical formalism is developed by utilizing Volkov-Bessel wave functions, and the four-current density is obtained as a crucial observable quantity. Numerical results illustrate the dynamics of vortex electrons in external lasers, showing that the beam center of the vortex electron follows the classical motion of a point charge electron, while maintaining the probability distribution structure for both vortex eigenstates and superposition modes. The combined effect of LP and CP laser pulses in the two-mode laser field allows for the versatile control of vortex electrons, which is absent with LP or CP lasers alone, at femtosecond and sub-nanometer scales. Our findings demonstrate the versatile control over vortex electrons via laser pulses, with our formalism providing a reference for vortex scattering in laser backgrounds and inspiring the laser-controlled achievement of novel vortex modes as targeted diagnostic probes for specialized materials.</description>

      <title>Search for Pauli Exclusion Principle Violations with Gator at LNGS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) appears from fundamental symmetries in quantum field theories, but its physical origin is still to be understood. High-precision experimental searches for small PEP violations permit testing key assumptions of the Standard Model with high sensitivity. We report on a dedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium detector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing PEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying on forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing electron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and an upper limit on the PEP violation probability of $\beta^2/2 &lt; 4.8 \cdot 10^{-29}$ (90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a comparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics is entering the multiparticle regime, paving the way for the use of arrays of strongly coupled massive oscillators to explore complex interacting quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate the trapping of two nanospheres inside a dual optical tweezer generated by two copropagating lasers operating at different wavelengths (1064 nm and 976 nm). Due to the chromatic aberration of the tweezer optics, two focal points are created approximately 9 microns apart, each one acting as an optical trap for a silica nanoparticle. At this distance, the surface charges on the nanospheres produce a Coulomb force that couples their motion along the tweezer axis. The strong coupling regime is achieved, as evidenced by the observed avoided crossing of the normal-mode frequencies. These results highlight the potential of our experimental scheme for future studies on systems of strongly coupled oscillators, including their implementation in optical cavities, both in the classical and in quantum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in manipulating droplet emissions from a thin vibrating fluid using submerged cavities, have introduced an innovative platform for generating hydrodynamic analogs of quantum and optical systems. This platform unlocks unique features not found in traditional pilot-wave hydrodynamics, inviting further exploration across varied physical settings to fully unravel its potential and limitations as a quantum analog. In this study, we explore how the recently reported phenomenon of hydrodynamic superradiance is affected when a single hydrodynamic cavity is taken to interact with a submerged reflective barrier. Our experimental findings reveal that the presence of a barrier near a cavity enhances its droplet emission rate, emulating the effect of a second cavity positioned at twice the distance. Moreover, the system exhibits a sinusoidal modulation of the emission rate as a function of the distance between the cavity and its mirror image, echoing the characteristic superradiance signature observed in optical systems. These findings broaden our understanding of wave-particle duality in hydrodynamic quantum analogs and suggest new pathways for replicating quantum behaviors in macroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting dynamics of quantum causal structures -- when can causal order evolve?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been substantial interest in studying the dynamics of quantum theory beyond that of states, in particular, the dynamics of channels, measurements, and higher-order transformations. Ref. [Phys. Rev. X 8(1), 011047 (2018)] pursues this using the process-matrix formalism, together with a definition of the possible dynamics of such process matrices, and focusing especially on the question of evolution of causal structures. One of its major conclusions is a strong theorem saying that within the formalism, under continuous and reversible transformations, the causal order between operations must be preserved. Our result here challenges that of Ref. [Phys. Rev. X 8(1), 011047 (2018)]: if one is to take into account a full picture of the physical evolution of operations within the standard quantum-mechanical formalism, then the conclusion of Ref. [Phys. Rev. X 8(1), 011047 (2018)] does not hold. That is, we show that under certain continuous and reversible dynamics, the causal order between operations is not necessarily preserved. We moreover identify and analyse the root of this apparent contradiction, specifically, that the commonly accepted and widely applied framework of higher-order processes, whilst mathematically sound, is not always appropriate for drawing conclusions on physical dynamics. Finally, we show how to reconcile the elements of the whole picture following the intuition based on entanglement processing by local operations and classical communication.</description>

Abstract: We prove that quantum-hard one-way functions imply simulation-secure quantum oblivious transfer (QOT), which is known to suffice for secure computation of arbitrary quantum functionalities. Furthermore, our construction only makes black-box use of the quantum-hard one-way function.
  Our primary technical contribution is a construction of extractable and equivocal quantum bit commitments based on the black-box use of quantum-hard one-way functions in the standard model. Instantiating the Cr\'epeau-Kilian (FOCS 1988) framework with these commitments yields simulation-secure QOT.</description>

      <title>Photon number resolving detectors as evidence for the corpuscular nature of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.04245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question of whether photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors provide compelling evidence for the discrete nature of light; i.e., whether they indicate the prior presence of a certain number of discrete photons. To answer this question, we reveal the insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing PNR detectors, and propose an alternative interpretation for the analysis of PNR detector output that is consistent with a wave picture of light and does not rely on the presumption of light particles. This interpretation is based on the aggregation of correlated or accidentally coincident detections within a given detector coincidence window. Our interpretation accounts for the arbitrary character of detector coincidence windows and includes connections to established treatments of intensity interferometers. To validate our interpretation, we performed an experiment on a multiplexed PNR detector and examined the dependence of photon number on the coincidence window via post-processing. These observations were then compared to a fully classical wave model based on amplitude threshold detection, and the results were found to be in excellent agreement. We find that results from low SNR PNR detectors, such as those existing in the literature, are able to be described by classical descriptions, and therefore do not demonstrate evidence for the discrete nature of light.</description>

Abstract: Cavity optomechanical (COM) sensors, enhanced by quantum squeezing or entanglement, have become powerful tools for measuring ultra-weak forces with high precision and sensitivity. However, these sensors usually rely on linear COM couplings, a fundamental limitation when measurements of the mechanical energy are desired. Very recently, a giant enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio was predicted in a quadratic COM system. Here we show that the performance of such a system can be further improved surpassing the standard quantum limit by using quantum squeezed light. Our approach is compatible with available engineering techniques of advanced COM sensors and provides new opportunities for using COM sensors in tests of fundamental laws of physics and quantum metrology applications.</description>

Abstract: Qubit Mapping is a critical aspect of implementing quantum circuits on real hardware devices. Currently, the existing algorithms for qubit mapping encounter difficulties when dealing with larger circuit sizes involving hundreds of qubits. In this paper, we introduce an innovative qubit mapping algorithm, Duostra, tailored to address the challenge of implementing large-scale quantum circuits on real hardware devices with limited connectivity. Duostra operates by efficiently determining optimal paths for double-qubit gates and inserting SWAP gates accordingly to implement the double-qubit operations on real devices. Together with two heuristic scheduling algorithms, the Limitedly-Exhausitive (LE) Search and the Shortest-Path (SP) Estimation, it yields results of good quality within a reasonable runtime, thereby striving toward achieving quantum advantage. Experimental results showcase our algorithm's superiority, especially for large circuits beyond the NISQ era. For example, on large circuits with more than 50 qubits, we can reduce the mapping cost on an average 21.75% over the virtual best results among QMAP, t|ket&gt;, Qiskit and SABRE. Besides, for mid-size circuits such as the SABRE-large benchmark, we improve the mapping costs by 4.5%, 5.2%, 16.3%, 20.7%, and 25.7%, when compared to QMAP, TOQM, t|ket&gt;, Qiskit, and SABRE, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning the Hamiltonian of a many-body quantum system from experimental data. We show that the rate of learning depends on the amount of control available during the experiment. We consider three control models: one where time evolution can be augmented with instantaneous quantum operations, one where the Hamiltonian itself can be augmented by adding constant terms, and one where the experimentalist has no control over the system's time evolution. With continuous quantum control, we provide an adaptive algorithm for learning a many-body Hamiltonian at the Heisenberg limit: $T = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, where $T$ is the total amount of time evolution across all experiments and $\epsilon$ is the target precision. This requires only preparation of product states, time-evolution, and measurement in a product basis. In the absence of quantum control, we prove that learning is standard quantum limited, $T = \Omega(\epsilon^{-2})$, for large classes of many-body Hamiltonians, including any Hamiltonian that thermalizes via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. These results establish a quadratic advantage in experimental runtime for learning with quantum control.</description>

For instance in the domain of energy economics, accurate and timely risk management demands for efficient simulation of millions of scenarios, largely benefiting from computational speedups. We develop a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on polynomial approximation of nonlinear functions, computed through Quantum Hadamard Products, and we rigorously assess the conditions for its end-to-end speedup for different implementation variants against classical algorithms. In our setting, a quadratic quantum speedup, up to polylogarithmic factors, can be proven only when forms are bilinear and approximating polynomials have second degree, if efficient loading unitaries are available for the input data sets. We also enhance the bidirectional encoding, that allows tuning the balance between circuit depth and width, proposing an improved version that can be exploited for the calculation of inner products. Lastly, we exploit the dynamic circuit capabilities, recently introduced on IBM Quantum devices, to reduce the average depth of the Quantum Hadamard Product circuit. A proof of principle is implemented and validated on IBM Quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Critical sensing with a single bosonic mode without boson-boson interactions</title>

Abstract: Critical phenomena of quantum systems are useful for enhancement of quantum sensing. However, experimental realizations of criticality enhancement have been confined to very few systems, owing to the stringent requirements, including the thermodynamical or scaling limit, and fine control of interacting quantum susystems or particles. We here propose a simple critical quantum sensing scheme that requires neither of these conditions. The critical system is realized with a single parametrically-driven bosonic mode involving many non-interacting bosons. We calculate the quantum Fisher information, and perform a simulation, which confirms the criticality-enabled enhancement. We further detail the response of one of the quadratures to the variation of the control parameter. The numerical results reveal that its inverted variance exhibits a diverging behavior at the critical point. Based on the presently available control techniques of parametric driving, we expect our scheme can be realized in different systems, e.g., ion traps and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond Gadgets: The Importance of Scalability for Analogue Quantum Simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum hardware has the potential to efficiently solve computationally difficult problems in physics and chemistry to reap enormous practical rewards. Analogue quantum simulation accomplishes this by using the dynamics of a controlled many-body system to mimic those of another system; such a method is feasible on near-term devices. We show that previous theoretical approaches to analogue quantum simulation suffer from fundamental barriers which prohibit scalable experimental implementation. By introducing a new mathematical framework and going beyond the usual toolbox of Hamiltonian complexity theory with an additional resource of engineered dissipation, we show that these barriers can be overcome. This provides a powerful new perspective for the rigorous study of analogue quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: With the advent of quantum technology, the interest in communication tasks assisted by quantum systems has increased both in academia and industry. Nonetheless, the transmission of a quantum state in real-world scenarios is bounded by environmental noise, so that the quantum channel is an open quantum system. In this work, we study a high dimensional non-Markovian open quantum system in a multi-core optical fiber by characterizing the environmental interaction as quantum operations, which here correspond to phase flips between pairs of computational basis states. The experimental platform is currently state-of-the-art for space division multiplexing optical fiber communication, which can serve as a robust channel for high-dimensional quantum communication. To test the channel, we perform a quantum communication task in the prepare-and-measure scenario. The non-Markovian nature of the system is demonstrated by implementing a Quantum Vault protocol. A better understanding of the phase noise in multi-core fibers could improve the stability and quality of several real-world communication protocols since they are a prime candidate to increase the telecom data transmission rate worldwide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a quantum algorithm for ground state preparation in the early fault tolerant regime. As a Monte Carlo-style quantum algorithm, our method features a Lindbladian where the target state is stationary. The construction of this Lindbladian is algorithmic and should not be seen as a specific approximation to some weakly coupled system-bath dynamics in nature. Our algorithm can be implemented using just one ancilla qubit and efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. It can prepare the ground state even when the initial state has zero overlap with the ground state, bypassing the most significant limitation of methods like quantum phase estimation. As a variant, we also propose a discrete-time algorithm, demonstrating even better efficiency and providing a near-optimal simulation cost depending on the desired evolution time and precision. Numerical simulation using Ising and Hubbard models demonstrates the efficacy and applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>

Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the total runtime has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. Numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we demonstrate that perturbation theory can help to reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04002v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a novel interpretation of quantum theory, which I will call Environmental Determinacy-based (EnDQT). In contrast to the well-known interpretations of quantum theory, EnDQT has the benefit of not adding non-local, superdeterministic, or retrocausal hidden variables. Also, it is not in tension with relativistic causality by providing a local causal explanation of quantum correlations. Furthermore, measurement outcomes don't vary according to, for example, systems or worlds. It is a conservative QT in the sense that, unlike theories such as spontaneous collapse theories, no modifications of the fundamental equations of quantum theory are required to establish when determinate values arise. Moreover, in principle, arbitrary systems can be in a coherent superposition for an arbitrary amount of time. According to EnDQT, at a certain stage of the evolution of the universe, some systems acquire the capacity to have and give rise to other systems having determinate values through an indeterministic process. Furthermore, this capacity propagates via local interactions between systems. When systems are isolated from others that have this capacity, they can, in principle, evolve unitarily indefinitely. EnDQT may provide payoffs to other areas of physics and their foundations, such as cosmology, via the features of the systems that start the chains of interactions.</description>

      <title>Superadditive Communication with the Green Machine: A Practical Demonstration of Nonlocality without Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving the ultimate Holevo limit of optical communication capacity requires a joint-detection receiver which makes a collective quantum measurement over multiple modulated symbols. Such superadditivity -- a higher communication rate than that achievable by symbol-by-symbol optical detection -- is a special case of the well-known nonlocality without entanglement and has yet to be demonstrated. In this article, we propose and demonstrate a design of joint-detection receivers, the Green Machine, that can achieve superadditivity. We build this receiver and show that its capacity surpasses any symbol-by-symbol receivers in the photon-starved regime with binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK). Our Green Machine receiver can also significantly reduce the transmitter peak power requirement compared with the pulse-position modulation (the conventional modulation format used for deep space laser communication). We further show that the self-referenced phase makes it immune to phase noise, e.g., atmospheric turbulence or platform vibrations.</description>

Abstract: The quantum stabilizer formalism was originally introduced to describe quantum error correction codes more conveniently and now are also playing an important role in many other fields, e.g., quantum computing and quantum foundation. In this dissertation, we first introduce relevant background and necessary basic knowledge, then introduce the definition of quantum stabilizer and its application in quantum system evolution and measurement. Finally, we try to extend the quantum stabilizer formalism to qubit-qutrit and qubit-ququart systems which not defined before, and further define quantum stabilizers of arbitrary composite systems.</description>

Abstract: Convex functions of quantum states play a key role in quantum physics, with examples ranging from Bell inequalities to von Neumann entropy. However, in experimental scenarios, direct measurements of these functions are often impractical. We address this issue by introducing two methods for determining rigorous confidence bounds for convex functions based on informationally incomplete measurements. Our approach outperforms existing protocols by providing tighter bounds for a fixed confidence level and number of measurements. We evaluate the performance of our methods using both numerical and experimental data. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, paving the way for improved quantum state certification in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Diffusion Model: A Fully Quantum-Mechanical Model for Generating Quantum State Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical diffusion models have shown superior generative results. Exploring them in the quantum domain can advance the field of quantum generative learning. This work introduces Quantum Generative Diffusion Model (QGDM) as their simple and elegant quantum counterpart. Through a non-unitary forward process, any target quantum state can be transformed into a completely mixed state that has the highest entropy and maximum uncertainty about the system. A trainable backward process is used to recover the former from the latter. The design requirements for its backward process includes non-unitarity and small parameter count. We introduce partial trace operations to enforce non-unitary and reduce the number of trainable parameters by using a parameter-sharing strategy and incorporating temporal information as an input in the backward process. We present QGDM's resource-efficient version to reduce auxiliary qubits while preserving generative capabilities. QGDM exhibits faster convergence than Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) because its adopted convex-based optimization can result in better convergence. The results of comparing it with QGAN demonstrate its effectiveness in generating both pure and mixed quantum states. It can achieve 53.02% higher fidelity in mixed-state generation than QGAN. The results highlight its great potential to tackle challenging quantum generation tasks.</description>

      <title>Beyond unital noise in variational quantum algorithms: noise-induced barren plateaus and limit sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08721v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) hold much promise but face the challenge of exponentially small gradients. Unmitigated, this barren plateau (BP) phenomenon leads to an exponential training overhead for VQAs. Perhaps the most pernicious are noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs), a type of unavoidable BP arising from open system effects, which have so far been shown to exist for unital noise maps. Here, we generalize the study of NIBPs to more general completely positive, trace-preserving maps, establishing the existence of NIBPs in the unital case and a class of non-unital maps we call Hilbert-Schmidt (HS)-contractive. The latter includes amplitude damping. We identify the associated phenomenon of noise-induced limit sets (NILS) of the VQA cost function and prove its existence for both unital and HS-contractive non-unital noise maps. Along the way, we extend the parameter shift rule of VQAs to the noisy setting. We provide rigorous bounds in terms of the relevant variables that give rise to NIBPs and NILSs, along with numerical simulations of the depolarizing and amplitude-damping maps that illustrate our analytical results.</description>

Abstract: Correlated errors caused by ionizing radiation impacting superconducting qubit chips are problematic for quantum error correction. Such impacts generate quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the qubit electrodes, which temporarily reduce qubit coherence significantly. The many energetic phonons produced by a particle impact travel efficiently throughout the device substrate and generate quasiparticles with high probability, thus causing errors on a large fraction of the qubits in an array simultaneously. We describe a comprehensive strategy for the numerical simulation of the phonon and quasiparticle dynamics in the aftermath of an impact. We compare the simulations with experimental measurements of phonon-mediated QP poisoning and demonstrate that our modeling captures the spatial and temporal footprint of the QP poisoning for various configurations of phonon downconversion structures. We thus present a path forward for the operation of superconducting quantum processors in the presence of ionizing radiation.</description>

      <title>$\zeta$-QVAE: A Quantum Variational Autoencoder utilizing Regularized Mixed-state Latent Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in near-term quantum computing is its application to large real-world datasets due to scarce quantum hardware resources. One approach to enabling tractable quantum models for such datasets involves compressing the original data to manageable dimensions while still representing essential information for downstream analysis. In classical machine learning, variational autoencoders (VAEs) facilitate efficient data compression, representation learning for subsequent tasks, and novel data generation. However, no model has been proposed that exactly captures all of these features for direct application to quantum data on quantum computers. Some existing quantum models for data compression lack regularization of latent representations, thus preventing direct use for generation and control of generalization. Others are hybrid models with only some internal quantum components, impeding direct training on quantum data. To bridge this gap, we present a fully quantum framework, $\zeta$-QVAE, which encompasses all the capabilities of classical VAEs and can be directly applied for both classical and quantum data compression. Our model utilizes regularized mixed states to attain optimal latent representations. It accommodates various divergences for reconstruction and regularization. Furthermore, by accommodating mixed states at every stage, it can utilize the full-data density matrix and allow for a "global" training objective. Doing so, in turn, makes efficient optimization possible and has potential implications for private and federated learning. In addition to exploring the theoretical properties of $\zeta$-QVAE, we demonstrate its performance on representative genomics and synthetic data. Our results consistently indicate that $\zeta$-QVAE exhibits similar or better performance compared to matched classical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from topologically-protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems, especially within topological flat bands. Departing from previous literature which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless 2D topological flat bands, however, exhibits novel $S_A\sim -\frac1{2}L_y^2\log L$ super volume-law entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension $L_y$, independent of system parameters. This dramatically negative scaling can be traced to a new mechanism known as non-Hermitian critical skin compression (nHCSC), where topological and skin localization in one direction produces a hierarchy of extensively many probability non-conserving entanglement eigenstates across a cut in another direction. Our discovery sheds light on new avenues where topology interplays with criticality and non-Hermitian localization, unrelated to traditional notions of topological entanglement entropy. This topologically protected negative entanglement also manifests in the second R\'enyi entropy, which can be measured through SWAP operator expecation values.</description>

Abstract: Quantum circuit partitioning (QCP) is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that aims to simulate large quantum systems on smaller quantum computers. A quantum computation is divided into smaller subsystems and results of measurements on these subsystems are combined using classical processing. In this paper, we propose a QCP strategy to measure an observable on a large quantum system by utilizing several quantum systems of smaller size. The method can be applied to both machine learning and variational ground state energy approximation, and we show that the required calculations and the variance of the gradients can be tailored to scale efficiently with the total number of qubits. Thus it can be utilized to mitigate the well-known problem of barren plateaus. Additionally, the method can be realized by performing simple measurements of Pauli-strings on the separate subsystems, and the gradients can be estimated with common methods such as the parameter-shift rule. We demonstrate the method by approximating the ground state energy of the 1D transverse-field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions, and by classifying handwritten digits. For the ground state energy approximation, we achieved a relative error within the order of 0.1% for all the tested system sizes. When applied to the classification between the digits 3 and 6, we were able to generalize to out-of-sample data with 100% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Open-system eigenstate thermalization in a noninteracting integrable model</title>

Abstract: Notable attention has been devoted to the problem of thermalization of observables in isolated quantum setups by individual eigenstates. Here, we approach this issue from an open quantum system perspective, by considering isolated setups which consists of a small system coupled to a macroscopic bath. We argue that in such a case, even in fully integrable models, the system observables exhibit thermalization when the system-bath setup is in a typical eigenstate of its Hamiltonian (which is called weak eigenstate thermalization). This occurs unless thermalization is suppressed by localization due to strong coupling. We illustrate our claim for a single fermionic level coupled to a noninteracting fermionic bath. We further show that upon quenching the system Hamiltonian, the system occupancy typically relaxes to the thermal value corresponding to the new Hamiltonian. Finally, we demonstrate that system thermalization also arises for a system coupled to a bath initialized in a typical eigenstate of its Hamiltonian. Our findings suggest that chaos and nonintegrability are not the sole drivers of thermalization and complementary approaches are needed to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how statistical mechanics emerges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithm Landscape Reconstruction by Low-Rank Tensor Completion</title>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a broad class of algorithms with many applications in science and industry. Applying a VQA to a problem involves optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit by maximizing or minimizing a cost function. A particular challenge associated with VQAs is understanding the properties of associated cost functions. Having the landscapes of VQA cost functions can greatly assist in developing and testing new variational quantum algorithms, but they are extremely expensive to compute. Reconstructing the landscape of a VQA using existing techniques requires a large number of cost function evaluations, especially when the dimension or the resolution of the landscape is high. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank tensor-completion-based approach for local landscape reconstruction. By leveraging compact low-rank representations of tensors, our technique can overcome the curse of dimensionality and handle high-resolution landscapes. We demonstrate the power of landscapes in VQA development by showcasing practical applications of analyzing penalty terms for constrained optimization problems and examining the probability landscapes of certain basis states.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Quantumness, Efficiency and Cost of Quantum Random Number Generators via Photon Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the availability of commercial QRNG devices, distinguishing between PRNG and QRNG outputs computationally remains challenging. This paper presents two significant contributions from the perspectives of QRNG manufacturers and users. For manufacturers, the conventional method of assessing the quantumness of single-photon-based QRNGs through mean and variance comparisons of photon counts is statistically unreliable due to finite sample sizes. Given the sub-Poissonian statistics of single photons, confirming the underlying distribution is crucial for validating a QRNG's quantumness. We propose a more efficient two-fold statistical approach to ensure the quantumness of optical sources with the desired confidence level. Additionally, we demonstrate that the output of QRNGs from exponential and uniform distributions exhibit similarity under device noise, deriving corresponding photon statistics and conditions for $\epsilon$-randomness.
  From the user's perspective, the fundamental parameters of a QRNG are quantumness (security), efficiency (randomness and random number generation rate), and cost. Our analysis reveals that these parameters depend on three factors, expected photon count per unit time, external reference cycle duration, and detection efficiency. A lower expected photon count enhances security but increases cost and decreases the generation rate. A shorter external reference cycle boosts security but must exceed a minimum threshold to minimize timing errors, with minor impacts on cost and rate. Lower detection efficiency enhances security and lowers cost but reduces the generation rate. Finally, to validate our results, we perform statistical tests like NIST, Dieharder, AIS-31, ENT etc. over the data simulated with different values of the above parameters. Our findings can empower manufacturers to customize QRNGs to meet user needs effectively.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models use encoding circuits to map data into a quantum Hilbert space. While it is well known that the architecture of these circuits significantly influences core properties of the resulting model, they are often chosen heuristically. In this work, we present a novel approach using reinforcement learning techniques to generate problem-specific encoding circuits to improve the performance of quantum machine learning models. By specifically using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, we reduce the number of necessary circuit evaluations during the search, providing a sample-efficient framework. In contrast to previous search algorithms, our method uses a layered circuit structure that significantly reduces the search space. Additionally, our approach can account for multiple objectives such as solution quality, hardware restrictions and circuit depth. We benchmark our tailored circuits against various reference models, including models with problem-agnostic circuits and classical models. Our results highlight the effectiveness of problem-specific encoding circuits in enhancing QML model performance.</description>

Abstract: If we want to transform the quantum of state of a system to another using local processes, what is the probability of success? It turns out that this probability can be bounded by quantifying entanglement within both the states. In this paper, we construct a family of multipartite entanglement measures that are monotonic under local operations and classical communication on average. The measures are constructed out of local unitary invariant polynomials of the state and its conjugate, and hence are easy to compute for pure states. Using these measures we bound the success probability of transforming a given state into another state using local quantum operations and classical communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Describing dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a complex many-body environment is a ubiquitous problem in quantum science. General non-Markovian environments are characterized by their influence matrix~(IM) -- a multi-time tensor arising from repeated interactions between the system and environment. While complexity of the most generic IM grows exponentially with the evolution time, recent works argued that for many instances of physical many-body environments, the IM is significantly less complex. This is thanks to area-law scaling of temporal entanglement, which quantifies the correlations between the past and the future states of the system. However, efficient classical algorithms for computing IM are only available for non-interacting environments or certain interacting 1D environments. Here, we study a learning algorithm for reconstructing IMs of large many-body environments simulated on a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm involves experimentally collecting quantum measurement results of auxiliary qubits which are repeatedly coupled to the many-body environment, followed by a classical machine-learning construction of a matrix-product (MPS) representation of the IM. Using the example of 1D spin-chain environments, with a classically generated training dataset, we demonstrate that the algorithm allows scalable reconstruction of IMs for long evolution times. The reconstructed IM can be used to efficiently model quantum transport through an impurity, including cases with multiple leads and time-dependent controls. These results indicate the feasibility of characterizing long-time dynamics of complex environments using a limited number of measurements, under the assumption of a moderate temporal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Improved Belief Propagation Decoding Algorithms for Surface Codes</title>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. Highly accurate and low-time-complexity decoding algorithms play an indispensable role in making sure quantum error correction works. Among existing decoding algorithms, belief propagation (BP) is notable for its nearly linear time complexity and general applicability to stabilizer codes. However, BP's decoding accuracy without post-processing is unsatisfactory in most situations. This article focuses on improving the decoding accuracy of BP over GF(4) for surface codes. We first propose Momentum-BP and AdaGrad-BP, inspired by machine learning optimization techniques, to reduce oscillation in message updating and break the symmetric trapping sets. We further propose EWAInit-BP, which adaptively updates initial probabilities and provides a 1 to 3 orders of magnitude improvement over traditional BP for planar surface code, toric code, and XZZX surface code without any post-processing method, showing high decoding accuracy even under parallel scheduling. The theoretical $O(1)$ time complexity under parallel scheduling and high accuracy of EWAInit-BP make it a promising candidate for high-precision real-time decoders. Meanwhile, the ideas of the Momentum-BP, AdaGrad-BP and EWAInit-BP provide promising approaches to improve the decoding accuracy of BP to get rid of its reliance on post-processing.</description>

Abstract: We study the possibility of discriminating between two bosonic dephasing quantum channels. We show that unambiguous discrimination is not realizable. We then consider discrimination with nonzero error probability and minimize this latter in the absence of input constraints. In the presence of an input energy constraint, we derive an upper bound on the error probability. Finally, we extend these results from single-shot to multi-shot discrimination, envisaging the asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. This strategy allows for the optimization of an entire neural network in a single training iteration in which, due to order of operations, a majority of the processing is done using a collapsed version of the training dataset. This inherently creates extremely fast training speeds, which are validated experimentally, compared to classical optimizers including Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experiments on retraining demonstrate a hundred times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be much larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the third-order out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) of a simple harmonic oscillator with an additional quartic interaction using the second quantization method. We obtain analytic relations for the spectrum, Fock space states, and matrix elements of the coordinate, which are then used to numerically calculate the OTOC. We observe that, after the scrambling, the OTOC saturates to a constant value at later times, which is associated with quantum chaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze the early-time properties of OTOC and find that the exponential growth, which indicates chaos, is evident in the third-order perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of the many-body localized (MBL) phase to the quantum-avalanche instability by studying the dynamics of a localized spin chain coupled to a $T=\infty$ thermal bath through its leftmost site. By analyzing local magnetizations, we estimate the size of the thermalized sector of the chain and find that it increases logarithmically slowly in time. This logarithmically slow propagation of the thermalization front allows us to lower bound the slowest thermalization time, and find a broad parameter range where it scales fast enough with the system size that MBL is robust against thermalization induced by avalanches. The further finding that the imbalance -- a global quantity measuring localization -- thermalizes over a time scale exponential both in disorder strength and system size is in agreement with these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research has shown that quantum walks can accelerate certain quantum algorithms and act as a universal paradigm for quantum processing. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, owing to its discrete nature, stands out as one of the most suitable choices for circuit implementation. Nevertheless, most current implementations are characterized by extensive, multi-layered quantum circuits, leading to higher computational expenses and a notable decrease in the number of confidently executable time steps on current quantum computers. Since quantum computers are not scalable enough in this NISQ era, we also must confine ourselves to the ancilla-free frontier zone. Therefore, in this paper, we have successfully cut down the circuit cost concerning gate count and circuit depth by half through our proposed methodology in qubit systems as compared to the state-of-the-art increment-decrement approach. Furthermore, for the engineering excellence of our proposed approach, we implement DTQW in any finite-dimensional quantum system with akin efficiency. To ensure an efficient implementation of quantum walks without requiring ancilla, we have incorporated an intermediate qudit technique for decomposing multi-qubit gates. Experimental outcomes hold significance far beyond the realm of just a few time steps, laying the groundwork for dependable implementation and utilization on quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study channel simulation under common randomness assistance in the finite-blocklength regime and identify the smooth channel max-information as a linear program one-shot converse on the minimal simulation cost for fixed error tolerance. We show that this one-shot converse can be achieved exactly using no-signaling-assisted codes, and approximately achieved using common randomness-assisted codes. Our one-shot converse thus takes on an analogous role to the celebrated meta-converse in the complementary problem of channel coding, and we find tight relations between these two bounds. We asymptotically expand our bounds on the simulation cost for discrete memoryless channels, leading to the second-order as well as the moderate deviation rate expansion, which can be expressed in terms of the channel capacity and channel dispersion known from noisy channel coding. Our bounds imply the well-known fact that the optimal asymptotic rate of one channel to simulate another under common randomness assistance is given by the ratio of their respective capacities. Additionally, our higher-order asymptotic expansion shows that this reversibility falls apart in the second order. Our techniques extend to discrete memoryless broadcast channels. In stark contrast to the elusive broadcast channel capacity problem, we show that the reverse problem of broadcast channel simulation under common randomness assistance allows for an efficiently computable single-letter characterization of the asymptotic rate region in terms of the broadcast channel's multipartite mutual information.</description>

      <title>Topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in higher dimensions and uniform spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon characterized by the aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems. While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions encounters a formidable challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and unveils that non-Hermitian skin effect in all spatial dimensions originates from point gaps. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are universally given by the uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ. Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin effect with generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles point gaps play, offering a unified understanding of the topological origin of non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Strong Spin-Motion Coupling in the Ultrafast Dynamics of Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15575</link>

Abstract: Rydberg atoms in optical lattices and tweezers is now a well established platform for simulating quantum spin systems. However, the role of the atoms' spatial wavefunction has not been examined in detail experimentally. Here, we show a strong spin-motion coupling emerging from the large variation of the interaction potential over the wavefunction spread. We observe its clear signature on the ultrafast many-body nanosecond-dynamics of atoms excited to a Rydberg $S$ state, using picosecond pulses, from an unity-filling atomic Mott-insulator. We also propose a novel approach to tune arbitrarily the strength of the spin-motion coupling relative to the motional energy scale set by trapping potentials. Our work provides a new direction for exploring the dynamics of strongly-correlated quantum systems by adding the motional degree of freedom to the Rydberg simulation toolbox.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Holographic Entropy Cone via Cycle Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by bit threads, we introduce a new prescription for computing entropy vectors outside the holographic entropy cone. By utilizing cycle flows on directed graphs, we show that the maximum cycle flow associated to any subset of vertices, which corresponds to a subsystem, manifestly obeys purification symmetry. Furthermore, by restricting ourselves to a subclass of directed graphs, we prove that the maximum cycle flow obeys both subadditivity and strong subadditivity, thereby establishing it as a viable candidate for the entropy associated to the subsystem. Finally, we demonstrate how our model generalizes the entropy vectors obtainable via conventional flows in undirected graphs, as well as conjecture that our model similarly generalizes the entropy vectors arising from hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Wormholes and Factorization in Exact Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the general framework of effective theories obtained via exact path integration of a complete theory over some sector of its degrees of freedom. Theories constructed this way contain multi-integrals which couple fields arbitrarily far apart, and in certain settings even on path-disconnected components of the space. These are not just entanglement, but genuine non-local interactions that we dub quantum wormholes.
  Any state the path integral of such an effective theory prepares is shown to be a partial trace of a state of the complete theory over the integrated-out sector. The resulting reduced density operator is generally mixed due to bra-ket wormholes. An infinite family of ensembles of pure states of the complete theory giving the same effective state is identified. These allow one to equivalently interpret any effective state as being prepared by an ensemble of theories. When computing entropic quantities, bra-ket wormholes give rise to replica wormholes. This causes replica path integrals for the effective theory to not factorize even when the underlying manifold does, as expected from mixing. In contrast, effective theories obtained by derivative expansions have no quantum wormholes and prepare pure states. There exist operators in the algebra of effective theories which can distinguish mixed from pure states, implying a breakdown of non-exact effective theories for sufficiently complex observables.
  This framework unifies and provides new insights into much of the phenomena observed in quantum gravity, including the interplay between wormholes and unitarity, the breakdown of bulk effective theory, the factorization puzzle, state ensembles, theory ensembles, quantum error correction, and baby universes. Some interesting lessons are drawn accounting also for characteristic aspects of gravity concerning IR/UV mixing and Kaluza-Klein reductions.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Horizon: Enabling Hybrid Quantum Transfer Learning for Long-Tailed Chest X-Ray Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential for improving the multi-label classification of rare, albeit critical, diseases in large-scale chest x-ray (CXR) datasets due to theoretical quantum advantages over classical machine learning (CML) in sample efficiency and generalizability. While prior literature has explored QML with CXRs, it has focused on binary classification tasks with small datasets due to limited access to quantum hardware and computationally expensive simulations. To that end, we implemented a Jax-based framework that enables the simulation of medium-sized qubit architectures with significant improvements in wall-clock time over current software offerings. We evaluated the performance of our Jax-based framework in terms of efficiency and performance for hybrid quantum transfer learning for long-tailed classification across 8, 14, and 19 disease labels using large-scale CXR datasets. The Jax-based framework resulted in up to a 58% and 95% speed-up compared to PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations, respectively. However, compared to CML, QML demonstrated slower convergence and an average AUROC of 0.70, 0.73, and 0.74 for the classification of 8, 14, and 19 CXR disease labels. In comparison, the CML models had an average AUROC of 0.77, 0.78, and 0.80 respectively. In conclusion, our work presents an accessible implementation of hybrid quantum transfer learning for long-tailed CXR classification with a computationally efficient Jax-based framework.</description>

      <title>Fading ergodicity</title>

Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, dubbed fading ergodicity regime, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo studies of quantum cosmology by the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum cosmology aims at elucidating the beginning of our Universe. Back in early 80's, Vilenkin and Hartle-Hawking put forward the "tunneling from nothing" and "no boundary" proposals. Recently there has been renewed interest in this subject from the viewpoint of defining the oscillating path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity using the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Aiming at going beyond the mini-superspace and saddle-point approximations, we perform Monte Carlo calculations using the generalized Lefschetz thimble method to overcome the sign problem. In particular, we confirm that either Vilenkin or Hartle-Hawking saddle point becomes relevant if one uses the Robin boundary condition depending on its parameter. We also clarify some fundamental issues in quantum cosmology, such as an issue related to the integration domain of the lapse function and an issue related to reading off the real geometry from the complex geometry obtained at the saddle point.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.
  This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.
  This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024. Our analyses identify pathways to migrate current applications to be quantum-resistant.</description>
