      <title>Para-exceptional sequences for tame hereditary algebras and McCammond-Sulway lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncrossing partition posets in a Coxeter group $W$ can fail to be lattices when $W$ is not finite. When the lattice property fails for $W$ of affine type, McCammond and Sulway's construction provides a larger lattice that contains the noncrossing partition poset and that furthermore is a combinatorial Garside structure. We construct a lattice, isomorphic to McCammond and Sulway's lattice, using the representation theory of a corresponding connected tame hereditary algebra and give a representation-theoretic proof that it is a combinatorial Garside structure. To construct the lattice, we introduce para-exceptional sequences and para-exceptional subcategories in the module categories of tame hereditary algebras. Para-exceptional sequences are generalizations of exceptional sequences obtained by enlarging the set of allowed entries to include all non-homogeneous bricks. A para-exceptional subcategory is a subcategory obtained by applying a certain closure-like operator to the wide subcategory generated by a para-exceptional sequence.</description>

      <title>Models for chain homotopy category of relative acyclic complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y})$ be a balanced pair in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$. Denote by ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{X})$ the chain homotopy category of right $\mathcal{X}$-acyclic complexes with all items in $\mathcal{X}$, and dually by ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{Y})$ the chain homotopy category of left $\mathcal{Y}$-acyclic complexes with all items in $\mathcal{Y}$. We establish realizations of ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{X})$ and ${\bf K}_{\mathcal{E}\text{-}{\rm ac}}(\mathcal{Y})$ as homotopy categories of model categories under mild conditions. Consequently, we obtain relative versions of recollements of Krause and Neeman-Murfet. We further give applications to Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules.</description>

      <title>On freeness of compactly induced mod-$p$ representations of $\rm{SL}_{2}(F)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, and $F$ a non-archimedean local field with residue characteristic $p$ and ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{F}$. Set $G_{S}:={\rm SL}_{2}(F)$and $K_{0}:={\rm SL}_{2}(\mathcal{O}_{F})$ . For a smooth irreducible $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{p}$-representation $\sigma$ of $K_{0}$, we study the structure of the compact induction ${\rm ind}_{K_{0}}^{G_{S}}(\sigma)$ as a left module over the standard spherical Hecke algebra ${\rm End}_{G_{S}}\left({\rm ind}_{K_{0}}^{G_{S}}(\sigma)\right)$. We prove that it is free and of infinite rank.</description>

      <title>Left Schur subcategories in recollements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently left Schur subcategories in a length abelian category were introduced by Enomoto, which unify torsion-free classes and wide subcategories. In this paper, we show the construction of left Schur subcategories in the recollements of length abelian categories. Moreover, we show the construction restricts to wide subcategories and torsion-free classes. As an application, we give an explicit construction of cofinally closed monobricks in recollements.</description>

      <title>Group algebras of reductive $p$-adic groups, their representations and their noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey paper about representation theory and noncommutative geometry of reductive p-adic groups G. The main focus points are:
  1. The structure of the Hecke algebra H(G), the Harish-Chandra-Schwartz algebra S(G) and the reduced C*-algebra $C_r^* (G)$.
  2. The classification of irreducible G-representations in terms of supercuspidal representations.
  3. The Hochschild homology and topological K-theory of these algebras.
  In the final part we prove one new result, namely we compute $K_* (C_r^* (G))$ including torsion elements, in terms of equivariant K-theory of compact tori.</description>

      <title>Completed Iwahori-Hecke algebra for Kac-Moody groups over local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split Kac-Moody group over a non-Archimedean local field, and let $\mathcal{H}$ be the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of $G$. In this paper, we construct a completed Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\widehat{\mathcal{H}}$ and prove that it contains a large center isomorphic to Looijenga's invariant ring. By the Kac-Moody Satake isomorphism, Looijenga's invariant ring is isomorphic to the spherical Hecke algebra. Our completion is constructed by considering Iwahori biinvariant functions on $G$ satisfying a support condition that we call Weyl almost finite support. We contrast our construction with another completion $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}$, defined early by Abdellatif and H\'ebert, which is defined algebraically via the Bernstein-Lusztig presentation and not in terms of functions on $G$.</description>

      <title>On the computation of Kronecker coefficients I: column-row polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a way of computing Kronecker coefficients that uses a new family of rational convex polytopes, called column-row polytopes. We give several different formulas for the computation. They are alternating sums of numbers of integer points of either column-row polytopes or faces of column-row polytopes. We also compute the maximal dimension of these polytopes and give new proofs of some known results of more theoretical nature.</description>

      <title>Affineness and reconstruction in higher Zariski geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain how the geometric framework introduced in arXiv:2508.11621 [math.AG] provides a universal property for the 2-rings of perfect complexes on qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral schemes. As an application, given a qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral scheme $X$ this produces a comparison morphism from $\operatorname{Spec} \mathrm{Perf}_{X}$ to $X$ itself, which is moreover natural in $X$. When $X$ is an ordinary qcqs scheme, this construction supplies a new proof of the Balmer-Thomason reconstruction of $X$ from its space of thick subcategories, assuming the result for noetherian rings due to Neeman. As another application, we find spectral and Dirac spectral enhancements of support varieties arising for 2-rings in representation theory which "geometrize" the 2-rings that produce them. For example, given a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, this produces a "spectral support variety" $\mathcal{V}_{G}$ such that $\mathrm{Perf}_{\mathcal{V}_{G}}$ maps into the stable module category of $kG$. We derive these results as a corollary of a general affineness criterion for 2-schemes which are covered by the Zariski spectra of rigid 2-rings: this states that such 2-schemes are affine if and only if they are quasicompact and quasiseparated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a bounded weight function on a language, and show that the set of bounded weight functions on a regular language is a rational polyhedral cone. We study the cell recognised by a bounded weight function (that is, the set of elements of the language where the bound is attained), and show that if the language is regular then this cell is regular. The related notion of a weight function on a finitely generated group is introduced, and the case of Coxeter groups is studied in detail. Applications to the representation theory of weighted Hecke algebras are given.</description>

      <title>Hopf BiGalois Theory for Hopf Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Hopf BiGalois extensions for Hopf algebroids. We understand these to be left bialgebroids (whose left module categories are monoidal categories) fulfilling a condition that is equivalent to being Hopf in the case of ordinary bialgebras, but does not entail the existence of an antipode map. The immediate obstacle to developing a full biGalois theory for such Hopf algebroids is simple: The condition to be a left Hopf Galois extension can be defined in complete analogy to the Hopf case, but the Galois map for a right comodule algebra is not a well defined map. We find that this obstacle can be circumvented using bialgebroids fulfilling a condition that still does not entail the existence of an antipode, but is equivalent, for ordinary bialgebras, to being Hopf with bijective antipode. The key technical tool is a result of Chemla allowing to switch left and right comodule structures under flatness conditions much like one would do using an antipode. Using this, we arrive at a left-right symmetric theory of biGalois extensions, including the construction of an Ehresmann Hopf algebroid making a one-sided Hopf-Galois extension into a biGalois one. Moreover, we apply a more general 2-cocycle twist theory to Ehresmann Hopf algebroids. As the 2-cocycle is only left linear over the base, the base algebra is also twisted. We also study the Ehresmann Hopf algebroids of quantum Hopf fibrations and quantum homogeneous space as examples.</description>

      <title>Polynomial representations of the Witt Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Witt algebra W_n is the Lie algebra of all derivations of the n-variable polynomial ring V_n=C[x_1, ..., x_n] (or of algebraic vector fields on A^n). A representation of W_n is polynomial if it arises as a subquotient of a sum of tensor powers of V_n. Our main theorems assert that finitely generated polynomial representations of W_n are noetherian and have rational Hilbert series. A key intermediate result states polynomial representations of the infinite Witt algebra are equivalent to representations of Fin^op, where Fin is the category of finite sets. We also show that polynomial representations of W_n are equivalent to polynomial representations of the endomorphism monoid of A^n. These equivalences are a special case of an operadic version of Schur--Weyl duality, which we establish.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we define the Burnside ring of a monoid, generalizing the construction for groups. After giving foundational definitions, we characterize transitive M-sets and their automorphisms, then prove a structure theorem for a broad class of monoids that allows us to write the Burnside ring as a direct product of Burnside rings of groups. Finally, we define a monoid correlate of the table of marks, and show that the Burnside algebra over the rationals is semisimple.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on recent successes concerning permutation resolutions of representations by Balmer and Gallauer we define a new invariant of finite groups: the p-permutation dimension. We define this analogously to the global dimension of a ring by replacing projective resolutions of ring modules with resolutions by p-permutation modules of modules over the group ring. We compute this invariant for cyclic groups of prime order.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Toda lattice and equivariant $K$-homology of affine Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon known as ``quantum equals affine'' in the setting of $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory of the flag variety $G/B$, as established by Kato for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. In particular, we focus on the $K$-Peterson isomorphism between the $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ and the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$ of the affine Grassmannian, after suitable localizations on both sides. Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi. This concrete formulation provides new insight into the combinatorial structure of the $K$-Peterson isomorphism in the equivariant setting. As an application, we establish a factorization formula for the $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur function associated with the maximal $k$-irreducible $k$-bounded partition.</description>

We define explicitly {commuting actions} of a quantized enveloping algebra of $\mf{g}$ and the $\imath$quantum group of {type AI and AII} on a $q$-deformed supersymmetric space, and describe its semisimple decomposition whose classical limit recovers the $(\mf{g},G)$-duality. As special cases, we obtain $q$-analogues of $(\mf{g},G)$-dualities on symmetric and exterior algebras for $\mf{g}=\mf{so}_{2n}$, $\mf{sp}_{2n}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative algebra in a braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$; e.g., $A$ could be an extension of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$-modules. We study when the category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ of local modules inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}$, and then we find conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}_A$ to inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$. First, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a braided finite tensor category and prove rigidity of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ under conditions based on criteria of Etingof-Ostrik for $A$ to be an exact algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. As a corollary, we show that if $A$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded VOA with a strongly rational vertex operator subalgebra $V$, then $A$ is strongly rational, without requiring the categorical dimension of $A$ as a $V$-module to be non-zero. Next, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ admits a weaker duality structure than rigidity. We first prove $\mathcal{C}_A$ is also a Grothendieck-Verdier category. Using this, we prove that if $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ is rigid, then so is $\mathcal{C}$ under conditions such as a mild non-degeneracy assumption on $\mathcal{C}$, an assumption that every simple object of $\mathcal{C}_A$ is local, and that induction from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_A$ commutes with duality. These conditions are motivated by free field-like VOA extensions $V\subseteq A$ where $A$ is often an indecomposable $V$-module, so our result will make it more feasible to prove rigidity for many vertex algebraic monoidal categories. In a follow-up work, our result will be used to prove rigidity of the category of weight modules for the simple affine VOA of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation theoretic multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</description>
