      <title>Note-Level Singing Melody Transcription for Time-Aligned Musical Score Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic music transcription converts audio recordings into symbolic representations, facilitating music analysis, retrieval, and generation. A musical note is characterized by pitch, onset, and offset in an audio domain, whereas it is defined in terms of pitch and note value in a musical score domain. A time-aligned score, derived from timing information along with pitch and note value, allows matching a part of the score with the corresponding part of the music audio, enabling various applications. In this paper, we consider an extended version of the traditional note-level transcription task that recognizes onset, offset, and pitch, through including extraction of additional note value to generate a time-aligned score from an audio input. To address this new challenge, we propose an end-to-end framework that integrates recognition of the note value, pitch, and temporal information. This approach avoids error accumulation inherent in multi-stage methods and enhances accuracy through mutual reinforcement. Our framework employs tokenized representations specifically targeted for this task, through incorporating note value information. Furthermore, we introduce a pseudo-labeling technique to address a scarcity problem of annotated note value data. This technique produces approximate note value labels from existing datasets for the traditional note-level transcription. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in note-level transcription tasks when compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also introduce new evaluation metrics that assess both temporal and note value aspects to demonstrate the robustness of the model. Moreover, qualitative assessments via visualized musical scores confirmed the effectiveness of our model in capturing the note values.</description>

      <title>Myna: Masking-Based Contrastive Learning of Musical Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12511v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Myna, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised musical representation learning. Built on a contrastive learning framework, Myna introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) on mel-spectrograms as the backbone and (2) a novel data augmentation strategy, token masking, that masks 90 percent of spectrogram tokens. These innovations deliver both effectiveness and efficiency: (i) Token masking enables a significant increase in per-GPU batch size, from 48 or 120 in prior methods (CLMR, MULE) to 4096. (ii) By avoiding traditional augmentations, Myna retains pitch sensitivity, enhancing performance in tasks like key detection. (iii) The use of vertical patches allows the model to better capture critical features for key detection. Our hybrid model, Myna-22M-Hybrid, processes both 16x16 and 128x2 patches, achieving state-of-the-art results. Trained on a single GPU, it outperforms MULE (62M) on average and rivals MERT-95M, which was trained on 16 and 64 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, it surpasses MERT-95M-public, establishing itself as the best-performing model trained on publicly available data. We release our code and models to promote reproducibility and facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>TechSinger: Technique Controllable Multilingual Singing Voice Synthesis via Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing voice synthesis has made remarkable progress in generating natural and high-quality voices. However, existing methods rarely provide precise control over vocal techniques such as intensity, mixed voice, falsetto, bubble, and breathy tones, thus limiting the expressive potential of synthetic voices. We introduce TechSinger, an advanced system for controllable singing voice synthesis that supports five languages and seven vocal techniques. TechSinger leverages a flow-matching-based generative model to produce singing voices with enhanced expressive control over various techniques. To enhance the diversity of training data, we develop a technique detection model that automatically annotates datasets with phoneme-level technique labels. Additionally, our prompt-based technique prediction model enables users to specify desired vocal attributes through natural language, offering fine-grained control over the synthesized singing. Experimental results demonstrate that TechSinger significantly enhances the expressiveness and realism of synthetic singing voices, outperforming existing methods in terms of audio quality and technique-specific control.

      <title>DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-alignment Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring DeepResonance for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We plan to open-source the models and the newly constructed datasets.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Music Vocoder using Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While neural vocoders have made significant progress in high-fidelity speech synthesis, their application on polyphonic music has remained underexplored. In this work, we propose DisCoder, a neural vocoder that leverages a generative adversarial encoder-decoder architecture informed by a neural audio codec to reconstruct high-fidelity 44.1 kHz audio from mel spectrograms. Our approach first transforms the mel spectrogram into a lower-dimensional representation aligned with the Descript Audio Codec (DAC) latent space before reconstructing it to an audio signal using a fine-tuned DAC decoder. DisCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in music synthesis on several objective metrics and in a MUSHRA listening study. Our approach also shows competitive performance in speech synthesis, highlighting its potential as a universal vocoder.</description>

      <title>Keep what you need : extracting efficient subnetworks from large audio representation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, research on audio foundation models has witnessed notable advances, as illustrated by the ever improving results on complex downstream tasks. Subsequently, those pretrained networks have quickly been used for various audio applications. These improvements have however resulted in a considerable increase both in size and complexity of these models. Along the environmental concerns this issue raises, this prevents the deployment of such networks on consumer-level devices, and precludes their use for real-time applications. Moreover, this appears contradictory with the specificity of the tasks for which these models are used, which are often simpler compared to extracting a rich, multi-purpose representation from any type of audio data. In this paper, we address this issue with a simple, yet effective method to extract lightweight specialist subnetworks from large foundation models. Specifically, we introduce learnable binary masks in-between the layers of a pretrained representation model. When training the end-to-end model on a downstream task, we add a sparsity-inducing loss to the overall objective, hence learning a compact subnetwork specialized on a single task. Importantly, the weights of the foundation model are kept frozen, resulting into low additional training costs. Once trained, the masked computational units can then be removed from the network, implying significant performance gains. We assess our method on three widespread audio foundation models, each based on a different backbone architecture, and illustrate its effectiveness on common audio representation evaluation tasks, as well as its versatility on both speech, music, and general audio.

      <title>Skip That Beat: Augmenting Meter Tracking Models for Underrepresented Time Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beat and downbeat tracking models are predominantly developed using datasets with music in 4/4 meter, which decreases their generalization to repertories in other time signatures, such as Brazilian samba which is in 2/4. In this work, we propose a simple augmentation technique to increase the representation of time signatures beyond 4/4, namely 2/4 and 3/4. Our augmentation procedure works by removing beat intervals from 4/4 annotated tracks. We show that the augmented data helps to improve downbeat tracking for underrepresented meters while preserving the overall performance of beat tracking in two different models. We also show that this technique helps improve downbeat tracking in an unseen samba dataset.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Stage Time-Context Network for Speech-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to irreversible cognitive decline in memory and communication. Early detection of AD through speech analysis is crucial for delaying disease progression. However, existing methods mainly use pre-trained acoustic models for feature extraction but have limited ability to model both local and global patterns in long-duration speech. In this letter, we introduce a Dual-Stage Time-Context Network (DSTC-Net) for speech-based AD detection, integrating local acoustic features with global conversational context in long-duration recordings.We first partition each long-duration recording into fixed-length segments to reduce computational overhead and preserve local temporal details.Next, we feed these segments into an Intra-Segment Temporal Attention (ISTA) module, where a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with frame-level attention extracts enhanced local features.Subsequently, a Cross-Segment Context Attention (CSCA) module applies convolution-based context modeling and adaptive attention to unify global patterns across all segments.Extensive experiments on the ADReSSo dataset show that our DSTC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models, reaching 83.10% accuracy and 83.15% F1.</description>

      <title>SongGen: A Single Stage Auto-regressive Transformer for Text-to-Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-song generation, the task of creating vocals and accompaniment from textual inputs, poses significant challenges due to domain complexity and data scarcity. Existing approaches often employ multi-stage generation procedures, resulting in cumbersome training and inference pipelines. In this paper, we propose SongGen, a fully open-source, single-stage auto-regressive transformer designed for controllable song generation. The proposed model facilitates fine-grained control over diverse musical attributes, including lyrics and textual descriptions of instrumentation, genre, mood, and timbre, while also offering an optional three-second reference clip for voice cloning. Within a unified auto-regressive framework, SongGen supports two output modes: mixed mode, which generates a mixture of vocals and accompaniment directly, and dual-track mode, which synthesizes them separately for greater flexibility in downstream applications. We explore diverse token pattern strategies for each mode, leading to notable improvements and valuable insights. Furthermore, we design an automated data preprocessing pipeline with effective quality control. To foster community engagement and future research, we will release our model weights, training code, annotated data, and preprocessing pipeline. The generated samples are showcased on our project page at https://liuzh-19.github.io/SongGen/ , and the code will be available at https://github.com/LiuZH-19/SongGen .</description>

      <title>Playing with Voices: Tabletop Role-Playing Game Recordings as a Diarization Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a proof of concept that audio of tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) could serve as a challenge for diarization systems. TTRPGs are carried out mostly by conversation. Participants often alter their voices to indicate that they are talking as a fictional character. Audio processing systems are susceptible to voice conversion with or without technological assistance. TTRPG present a conversational phenomenon in which voice conversion is an inherent characteristic for an immersive gaming experience. This could make it more challenging for diarizers to pick the real speaker and determine that impersonating is just that. We present the creation of a small TTRPG audio dataset and compare it against the AMI and the ICSI corpus. The performance of two diarizers, pyannote.audio and wespeaker, were evaluated. We observed that TTRPGs' properties result in a higher confusion rate for both diarizers. Additionally, wespeaker strongly underestimates the number of speakers in the TTRPG audio files. We propose TTRPG audio as a promising challenge for diarization systems.</description>

      <title>An Attention-Assisted AI Model for Real-Time Underwater Sound Speed Estimation Leveraging Remote Sensing Sea Surface Temperature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12817v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of underwater sound velocity distribution serves as a critical basis for facilitating effective underwater communication and precise positioning, given that variations in sound velocity influence the path of signal transmission. Conventional techniques for the direct measurement of sound velocity, as well as methods that involve the inversion of sound velocity utilizing acoustic field data, necessitate on--site data collection. This requirement not only places high demands on device deployment, but also presents challenges in achieving real-time estimation of sound velocity distribution. In order to construct a real-time sound velocity field and eliminate the need for underwater onsite data measurement operations, we propose a self-attention embedded multimodal data fusion convolutional neural network (SA-MDF-CNN) for real-time underwater sound speed profile (SSP) estimation. The proposed model seeks to elucidate the inherent relationship between remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) data, the primary component characteristics of historical SSPs, and their spatial coordinates. This is achieved by employing CNNs and attention mechanisms to extract local and global correlations from the input data, respectively. The ultimate objective is to facilitate a rapid and precise estimation of sound velocity distribution within a specified task area. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper has lower root mean square error (RMSE) and stronger robustness than other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Soundwave: Less is More for Speech-Text Alignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing end-to-end speech large language models (LLMs) usually rely on large-scale annotated data for training, while data-efficient training has not been discussed in depth. We focus on two fundamental problems between speech and text: the representation space gap and sequence length inconsistency. We propose Soundwave, which utilizes an efficient training strategy and a novel architecture to address these issues. Results show that Soundwave outperforms the advanced Qwen2-Audio in speech translation and AIR-Bench speech tasks, using only one-fiftieth of the training data. Further analysis shows that Soundwave still retains its intelligence during conversation. The project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/Soundwave.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Missing Modality: A Knowledge-Transfer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to identify the emotions expressed by individuals through visual, language, and acoustic cues. However, most of the existing research efforts assume that all modalities are available during both training and testing, making their algorithms susceptible to the missing modality scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-transfer network to translate between different modalities to reconstruct the missing audio modalities. Moreover, we develop a cross-modality attention mechanism to retain the maximal information of the reconstructed and observed modalities for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baselines and achieve comparable results to the previous methods with complete multi-modality supervision.</description>

Abstract: Cognitive impairment detection through spontaneous speech is a promising avenue for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where timely intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. The PROCESS Grand Challenge at ICASSP 2025 addresses these tasks by promoting innovative classification and regression methods for detecting cognitive decline. In this paper, we propose a multimodal fusion strategy that combines interpretable linguistic features with temporal embeddings extracted from pre-trained models. Our approach achieves an F1-score of 0.649 for the classification task (predicting healthy, MCI, dementia) and an RMSE of 2.628 for the regression task (MMSE score prediction), securing the top overall ranking in the competition.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.</description>

      <title>VoxEval: Benchmarking the Knowledge Understanding Capabilities of End-to-End Spoken Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rising need for speech-based interaction models, end-to-end Spoken Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as a promising solution. While these models require comprehensive world knowledge for meaningful and reliable human interactions, existing question-answering (QA) benchmarks fall short in evaluating SLMs' knowledge understanding due to their inability to support end-to-end speech evaluation and account for varied input audio conditions. To address these limitations, we present VoxEval, a novel SpeechQA benchmark that assesses SLMs' knowledge understanding through pure speech interactions. Our benchmark 1) uniquely maintains speech format for both inputs and outputs, 2) evaluates model robustness across diverse input audio conditions, and 3) pioneers the assessment of complex tasks like mathematical reasoning in spoken format. Systematic evaluation demonstrates that VoxEval presents significant challenges to current SLMs, revealing their sensitivity to varying audio conditions and highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in future development. We hope this benchmark could guide the advancement of more sophisticated and reliable SLMs.\footnote{VoxEval dataset is available at: https://github.com/dreamtheater123/VoxEval</description>

      <title>Improving Rare-Word Recognition of Whisper in Zero-Shot Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whisper, despite being trained on 680K hours of web-scaled audio data, faces difficulty in recognising rare words like domain-specific terms, with a solution being contextual biasing through prompting. To improve upon this method, in this paper, we propose a supervised learning strategy to fine-tune Whisper for contextual biasing instruction. We demonstrate that by using only 670 hours of Common Voice English set for fine-tuning, our model generalises to 11 diverse open-source English datasets, achieving a 45.6% improvement in recognition of rare words and 60.8% improvement in recognition of words unseen during fine-tuning over the baseline method. Surprisingly, our model's contextual biasing ability generalises even to languages unseen during fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Step-Audio: Unified Understanding and Generation in Intelligent Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time speech interaction, serving as a fundamental interface for human-machine collaboration, holds immense potential. However, current open-source models face limitations such as high costs in voice data collection, weakness in dynamic control, and limited intelligence. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Step-Audio, the first production-ready open-source solution. Key contributions include: 1) a 130B-parameter unified speech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and generation, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced; 2) a generative speech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and produces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through distillation; 3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic adjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP; 4) an enhanced cognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities to manage complex tasks effectively. Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360 evaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human evaluations, especially in terms of instruction following. On open-source benchmarks like LLaMA Question, shows 9.3% average performance improvement, demonstrating our commitment to advancing the development of open-source multi-modal language technologies.
