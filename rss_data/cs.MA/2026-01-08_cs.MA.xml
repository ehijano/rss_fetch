      <title>PC2P: Multi-Agent Path Finding via Personalized-Enhanced Communication and Crowd Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) integrated with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent research focus, enabling real-time cooperative decision-making in partially observable environments through inter-agent communication. However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who" and ``what" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enabled Multi-Agent Systems: Empirical Evaluation and Insights into Emerging Design Patterns &amp; Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper formalises the literature on emerging design patterns and paradigms for Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled multi-agent systems (MAS), evaluating their practical utility across various domains. We define key architectural components, including agent orchestration, communication mechanisms, and control-flow strategies, and demonstrate how these enable rapid development of modular, domain-adaptive solutions. Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity. We conclude by outlining critical research directions for improving reliability, scalability, and governance in MAS architectures and the further work needed to mature MAS design patterns to mitigate the inherent challenges.</description>

      <title>A Chromatographic Process Design and Optimization Platform Powered by Large Language Models: A Case Application on Extract of Ginkgo Biloba Leaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatographic separation technology has been widely applied in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries due to its high efficiency. However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm. An intelligent, automated, and universally applicable new paradigm was established for chromatographic process development.</description>

      <title>When Numbers Start Talking: Implicit Numerical Coordination Among LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Sensor to Pixels: Decentralized Swarm Gathering via Image-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.</description>

      <title>Online Decision-Making Under Uncertainty for Vehicle-to-Building Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Introducing The Maximum Common Bigraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bigraph reactive systems offer a powerful and flexible mathematical framework for modelling both spatial and non-spatial relationships between agents, with practical applications in domains such as smart technologies, networks, sensor systems, and biology. While bigraphs theoretically support the identification of bisimilar agents, by simulating and comparing their corresponding minimal contextual transition systems, no known algorithm exists for computing the maximum shared structure between two bigraphs, an essential prerequisite for determining the set of possible transitions for a given agent state. In this work, we provide a definition of the maximum common bigraph problem, and present an adaptation of the McSplit maximum common induced subgraph algorithm to compute the maximum common bigraph between two bigraph states. Our approach opens a path toward supporting bisimulation checking in bigraph-based tools, which have been leveraged in other modelling paradigms for simplification, optimisation, and verification of models.</description>

      <title>Computing Universal Plans for Partially Observable Multi-Agent Routing Using Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent routing problems have gained significant attention recently due to their wide range of industrial applications, ranging from logistics warehouse automation to indoor service robots. Conventionally, they are modeled as classical planning problems. In this paper, we argue that it can be beneficial to formulate them as universal planning problems, particularly when the agents are autonomous entities and may encounter unforeseen situations. We therefore propose universal plans, also known as policies, as the solution concept, and implement a system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) to compute them. Given an arbitrary two-dimensional map and a profile of goals for a group of partially observable agents, the system translates the problem configuration into logic programs and finds a feasible universal plan for each agent, mapping its observations to actions while ensuring that there are no collisions with other agents. We use the system to conduct experiments and obtain findings regarding the types of goal profiles and environments that lead to feasible policies, as well as how feasibility may depend on the agents' sensors. We also demonstrate how users can customize action preferences to compute more efficient policies, even (near-)optimal ones. The code is available at https://github.com/Fernadoo/MAPF_ASP.</description>

      <title>The Combined Problem of Online Task Assignment and Lifelong Path Finding in Logistics Warehouses: Rule-Based Systems Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the combined problem of online task assignment and lifelong path finding, which is crucial for the logistics industries. However, most literature either (1) focuses on lifelong path finding assuming a given task assigner, or (2) studies the offline version of this problem where tasks are known in advance. We argue that, to maximize the system throughput, the online version that integrates these two components should be tackled directly. To this end, we introduce a formal framework of the combined problem and its solution concept. Then, we design a rule-based lifelong planner under a practical robot model that works well even in environments with severe local congestion. Upon that, we automate the search for the task assigner with respect to the underlying path planner. Simulation experiments conducted in warehouse scenarios at Meituan, one of the largest shopping platforms in China, demonstrate that (a)in terms of time efficiency, our system requires only 83.77% of the execution time needed for the currently deployed system at Meituan, outperforming other SOTA algorithms by 8.09%; (b)in terms of economic efficiency, ours can achieve the same throughput with only 60% of the agents currently in use. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/Fernadoo/Online-TAPF.</description>

      <title>Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Trust and Reputation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern socio-technical systems increasingly involve multi-stakeholder environments where actors simultaneously cooperate and compete. These coopetitive relationships exhibit dynamic trust evolution based on observed behavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence. Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in conceptual models that capture strategic dependencies covering mixed motives of actors. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. Building on companion work that achieved 58/60 validation (96.7%) for logarithmic specifications, we introduce trust as a two-layer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We develop a structured translation framework enabling practitioners to instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks encompassing mixed motives of actors. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49/60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.</description>

      <title>FinPos: A Position-Aware Trading Agent System for Real Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial trading. However, most existing trading agents operate under intraday, independent unit-based trading tasks, where decisions are made as isolated directional actions, and thus lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic market. To address this task, we propose FinPos, a position-aware trading agent system designed to explicitly model and manage continuous positions. FinPos enhances position awareness through three key mechanisms: (1) professional-level interpretation of heterogeneous market information; (2) a dual-agent decision structure that separates directional reasoning from risk-aware position adjustment; and (3) multi-timescale reward signals, allowing the agent to internalize position awareness through experiential feedback rather than static instructions alone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.</description>

      <title>Noncooperative Consensus via a Trading-based Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noncooperative multi-agent systems often face coordination challenges due to conflicting preferences among agents. In particular, when agents act in their own self-interest, they may prefer different choices among multiple feasible outcomes, leading to suboptimal outcomes or even safety concerns. We propose an algorithm named trading auction for consensus (TACo), a decentralized approach that enables noncooperative agents to reach consensus without communicating directly or disclosing private valuations. TACo facilitates coordination through a structured trading-based auction, where agents iteratively select choices of interest and provably reach an agreement within an a priori bounded number of steps. A series of numerical experiments validate that the termination guarantees of TACo hold in practice, and show that TACo achieves a median performance that minimizes the total cost across all agents, while allocating resources significantly more fairly than baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>SPIO: Ensemble and Selective Strategies via LLM-Based Multi-Agent Planning in Automated Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled dynamic reasoning in automated data analytics, yet recent multi-agent systems remain limited by rigid, single-path workflows that restrict strategic exploration and often lead to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a framework that replaces rigid workflows with adaptive, multi-path planning across four core modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, specialized agents generate diverse candidate strategies, which are cascaded and refined by an optimization agent. SPIO offers two operating modes: SPIO-S for selecting a single optimal pipeline, and SPIO-E for ensembling top-k pipelines to maximize robustness. Extensive evaluations on Kaggle and OpenML benchmarks show that SPIO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average performance gain of 5.6%. By explicitly exploring and integrating multiple solution paths, SPIO delivers a more flexible, accurate, and reliable foundation for automated data science.</description>

Abstract: With the proliferation of LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern. Once MAS is induced to trust a malicious link, attackers can use it as a springboard to expand the attack surface. In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack manipulating unique structures of web links to deceive MAS. We design 12 representative attack variants that encompass various methods, such as homoglyph deception, sub-directory nesting, and parameter obfuscation. Through extensive experiments on these attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input design, lowering the threshold for attacks significantly. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks, providing new insights into MAS safety.

      <title>When Identity Skews Debate: Anonymization for Bias-Reduced Multi-Agent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07517</link>

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions. Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias and improving trustworthiness. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled bias metric that measures an agent's tendency to follow its peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models and benchmarks confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than identity. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.</description>

      <title>Enabling Agents to Communicate Entirely in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by telepathy, which bypasses symbolic language in communication, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the continuous last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its thought for direct communication (termed latent communication). An additional learned compression process further compresses latent communication via latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, even across heterogeneous models, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference by up to 24 times but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>V-Agent: An Interactive Video Search System Using Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce V-Agent, a novel multi-agent platform designed for advanced video search and interactive user-system conversations. By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications. The retrieval model and demo videos are available at https://huggingface.co/NCSOFT/multimodal-embedding.</description>
