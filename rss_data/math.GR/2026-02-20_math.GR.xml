      <title>On Finiteness of Homological Isoperimetric Functions on Top Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a question from \cite{BKV25} regarding the finiteness of the homological $R$-isoperimetric function. Let $R$ be a subfield of the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ with the absolute value norm. We prove that for any group $G$ that admits a finite $(n+1)$-dimensional model for $K(G,1)$, the homological $n$-isoperimetric function of $G$ over $R$ is either linear or takes infinite values. In particular, by results of Gersten and Mineyev, in the class of groups admitting a finite $2$-dimensional classifying space, the homological $1$-dimensional isoperimetric function over $R$ only captures hyperbolicity. This follows as a particular case of a more general result proved in this note.</description>

      <title>Characters and $II_1$-Factor Representations of Full Groups of Cantor Minimal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,T)$ be a Cantor minimal system, and let $\Gamma$ denote either its associated topological full group or the full group of a Bratteli diagram associated with $(X,T)$. In this paper we describe the structure of indecomposable (extreme) characters and the associated $\textrm{II}_1$-factor representations for the group $\Gamma$ and its commutator subgroup $\Gamma'$. In particular, we prove that: (1) for every nontrivial indecomposable character $\chi$ of $\Gamma'$, there exists a finite collection (with repetitions allowed) $\{\mu_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $T$-invariant ergodic measures on $X$ such that $\chi(\gamma) = \prod_{i\in I} \mu_i(Fix(\gamma))$, for every $\gamma \in \Gamma'$, where $Fix(\gamma) = \{x\in X : \gamma x = x\}$; and (2) each indecomposable character of $\Gamma$ is the product of an indecomposable character of the form $\prod_{i\in I} \mu_i(Fix(\gamma))$ and a homomorphism from $\Gamma$ into the unit circle.
  As a consequence, we show that any finite-type unitary representation of $\Gamma'$ that does not contain a regular subrepresentation is automatically continuous with respect to the uniform topology on $\Gamma'$.
  We also establish a general result on automatic continuity of finite-type unitary representations of infinite groups, which we use in our proofs.</description>

      <title>Cohomological and quasi-isometric diversity of groups with property $R_\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How rich is the collection of groups with a given prominent property? In this work we approach this question for property~$R_\infty$, which says that every automorphism $\varphi$ of a given group has infinitely many orbits under the $\varphi$-twisted conjugation action $(g,x) \mapsto gx\varphi(g)^{-1}$. Generalising the soluble groups of Herbert Abels to a large family over many integral domains, we prove that most such groups have property~$R_\infty$ drawing from a classical result of Levchuk and a swift observation by Jabara. Within the broad programme of cataloguing finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry, our groups can then be separated by finiteness properties and cohomological dimension whilst having~$R_\infty$. Abandoning finite presentability, we establish that property~$R_\infty$ is very abundant in a strong sense: there are uncountably many finitely generated groups (which can all be chosen to be amenable or non-amenable) that have~$R_\infty$ and are pairwise not quasi-isometric. The proofs vary in flavour. On the amenable side we use carefully constructed quotients of Abels' groups and a general strategy for quasi-isometric diversity established by Minasyan, Osin, and Witzel. For the non-amenable constructions we rely on modifications of Leary's type $\mathtt{FP}$ groups, further cohomological arguments, and recent powerful criteria for~$R_\infty$ due to Iveson, Martino, Sgobbi, Wong, and Fournier-Facio.</description>

      <title>Comparing Numbers of Diagonal Subsemigroups and Congruences for Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a semigroup $S$, a diagonal subsemigroup $\rho$ is defined to be a reflexive and compatible relation on $S$, i.e. a subsemigroup of the direct square $S\times S$ containing the diagonal $\{ (s,s)\colon s\in S\}$. When $S$ is finite, we define the DSC coefficient $\chi(S)$ to be the ratio of the number of congruences to the number of diagonal subsemigroups. In a previous work we observed that $\chi(S) = 1$ if and only if $S$ is a group. Here we show that for any rational $\alpha$ with $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$, there exists a semigroup with $\chi(S) = \alpha$. We do this by utilizing the Rees matrix construction and adapting the congruence classification of such semigroups to describe their diagonal subsemigroups.</description>

      <title>Dehn quandles of surfaces and their bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new families of quandles that serve as invariants for classifying closed orientable surfaces. These families generalize the classical Dehn quandle and are defined, respectively, on isotopy classes of unoriented closed curves and on integral weighted multicurves. We establish their fundamental algebraic properties and construct a natural quandle covering that relates them. We then analyze their metric properties, showing that these quandles are unbounded with respect to the quandle metric. Next, we compute their second bounded quandle cohomology, proving it to be infinite-dimensional. We also establish a version of the Gromov Mapping Theorem, showing that the natural map from an abelian quandle extension onto the original quandle induces an injection on bounded quandle cohomology in every dimension. Finally, inspired by recent developments in quandle rings, we analyze idempotents in the integral quandle rings arising from the classical Dehn quandle of a surface.</description>

      <title>On the Subgroup Distance Problem in Cyclic Permutation Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Subgroup distance problem regarding the Hamming distance, the Cayley distance and the $l_\infty$ distance is NP-complete when the input group is cyclic. When we restrict the $l_\infty$ distance to fixed values we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether there are numbers $z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha_1^{z_1}\alpha_2^{z_2}) \leq 1$ for permutation $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta \in S_n$ where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ commute. However on the positive side we can show that it can be decided in NL whether there is a number $z \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha^z) \leq 1$ for permutations $\alpha,\beta \in S_n$. For the former we provide a tool, namely for all numbers $t_1,t_2,t \in \mathbb{N}$ where $t$ is required to be odd, $0 \leq t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; t$ and $t_1 \not\equiv t_2 \bmod q$ for all primes $q \mid t$ we give a constructive proof for the existence of permutations $\alpha,\beta \in S_t$ with $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha^{t_1}) \leq 1$ and $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha^{t_2}) \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>On the intersections of nilpotent subgroups in simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H_p$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. A recent conjecture of Lisi and Sabatini asserts the existence of an element $x \in G$ such that $H_p \cap H_p^x$ is inclusion-minimal in the set $\{H_p \cap H_p^g \,:\, g \in G\}$ for every prime $p$. For a simple group $G$, in view of a theorem of Mazurov and Zenkov from 1996, the conjecture implies the existence of an element $x \in G$ with $H_p \cap H_p^x = 1$ for all $p$. In turn, this statement implies a conjecture of Vdovin from 2002, which asserts that if $G$ is simple and $H$ is a nilpotent subgroup, then $H \cap H^x = 1$ for some $x \in G$.
  In this paper, we adopt a probabilistic approach to prove the Lisi-Sabatini conjecture for all non-alternating simple groups. By combining this with earlier work of Kurmazov on nilpotent subgroups of alternating groups, we complete the proof of Vdovin's conjecture. Moreover, by combining our proof with earlier work of Zenkov on alternating groups, we are able to establish a stronger form of Vdovin's conjecture: if $G$ is simple and $A,B$ are nilpotent subgroups, then $A \cap B^x = 1$ for some $x \in G$. To obtain these results, we study the probability that a random pair of Sylow $p$-subgroups in a simple group of Lie type intersect trivially, complementing recent work of Diaconis et al. and Eberhard on symmetric and alternating groups.</description>
