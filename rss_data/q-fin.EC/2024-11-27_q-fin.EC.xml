      <title>The Economics of Climate Adaptation: An Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost of the impacts of climate change have already proven to be larger than previously believed. Understanding the costs and benefits of adapting to the changing climate is necessary to make targeted and appropriate investment decisions. In this paper, we use a narrative review to synthesize the current literature on the economic case for climate adaptation, with the objective of assessing the value (economic and otherwise) of climate change adaptation, as well as the strength of the methods and evidence that have been used to date. We find that skepticism is warranted about many of the estimates about costs and benefits of climate adaptation and their underlying assumptions, due to a range of complexities associated with (1) uncertainty in distinguishing the economic impacts of climate change from seasonal variability; (2) difficulties in non-market valuation; (3) lack of consistent data collection over time at multiple scales; and (4) distributional inequities in access to proactive adaptation and recovery funding. While useful for broad stroke advocacy purposes, these estimates fall short of the refinement and rigor needed to inform investment decision-making, particularly at micro and local scales. Most estimates rely on cost benefit analysis and do not effectively address these issues. An emergent and promising literature tackles alternative estimation strategies and attempts to address some of them, including the complexities of uncertainty and non-market valuation.</description>

      <title>Expectation Formation in a Simple New Keynesian DSGE Framework: A Comparative Analysis of Behavioral and Rational Expectations in the Indian Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model has become a cornerstone of macroeconomic analysis, yet research in emerging economies like India remains limited. This study makes a significant contribution by introducing behavioral expectation formation into a New Keynesian DSGE model of the Indian economy, a novel approach absent in existing literature. While previous studies have exclusively employed rational expectations, this research comparatively examines behavioral and rational expectation frameworks. Using the output gap and the inflation rate, we find nuanced differences in model performance: behavioral expectations more effectively capture the constructed output gap characteristics, while rational expectations capture the inflation dynamics better. These findings have critical implications for future macroeconomic modeling and policy design, suggesting context-specific expectation formation strategies.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference in Finance: An Expertise-Driven Model for Instrument Variables Identification and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instrumental Variable (IV) provides a source of treatment randomization that is conditionally independent of the outcomes, responding to the challenges of counterfactual and confounding biases. In finance, IV construction typically relies on pre-designed synthetic IVs, with effectiveness measured by specific algorithms. This classic paradigm cannot be generalized to address broader issues that require more and specific IVs. Therefore, we propose an expertise-driven model (ETE-FinCa) to optimize the source of expertise, instantiate IVs by the expertise concept, and interpret the cause-effect relationship by integrating concept with real economic data. The results show that the feature selection based on causal knowledge graphs improves the classification performance than others, with up to a 11.7% increase in accuracy and a 23.0% increase in F1-score. Furthermore, the high-quality IVs we defined can identify causal relationships between the treatment and outcome variables in the Two-Stage Least Squares Regression model with statistical significance.</description>

      <title>Belief patterns with information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model of costly information acquisition where decision-makers can choose whether to elaborate information superficially or precisely. The former action is costless, while the latter entails a processing cost. Within this framework, decision-makers' beliefs may polarize even after they have access to the same evidence. From the perspective of a Bayesian observer who neglects information processing constraints, the decision-makers' optimal behavior and belief updating may appear consistent with biases such as disconfirmation, underreaction to information, and confirmation bias. However, these phenomena emerge naturally within the model and are fully compatible with standard Bayesian inference and rational decision-making when accounting for the costs of information acquisition.</description>

      <title>Coping with the Dunkelflaute: Power system implications of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coping with prolonged periods of low availability of wind and solar power, also referred to as "Dunkelflaute", emerges as a key challenge for realizing a decarbonized European energy system fully based on renewable energy sources. Here, we investigate the role of long-duration electricity storage and geographical balancing in dealing with such variable renewable energy droughts. To this end, we combine renewable availability time series analysis and power sector modeling, using 36 historic weather years. We find that extreme drought events define long-duration storage operation and investment. The most extreme event in Europe occurred in the winter of 1996/97. Assuming policy-relevant interconnection, long-duration storage of 351 TWh or 7% of yearly electricity demand would be required to deal with this event. As it affects many countries simultaneously, a storage capacity of 159 TWh or 3% of yearly electricity demand remains required even in the extreme case of unconstrained geographical balancing. Before and during Dunkelflaute events, we find complex interactions of long-duration storage with other flexibility options. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that firm zero-emission generation technologies would only moderately reduce long-duration storage needs. Thus, policymakers and system planners should prepare for a rapid expansion of long-duration storage capacity to safeguard the renewable energy transition in Europe. We further argue that including multiple weather years is required for weather-resilient energy system modeling, particularly those with pronounced renewable energy droughts.</description>

      <title>Comparing Electoral Polarization Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a definition of ideological polarization of an electorate around a particular central point. The definition is flexible about the location or boundaries of the center. Using US survey data, the paper shows how this approach can be used to establish whether polarization is occurring, and to find the position around which it is happening. I then show how ideological polarization as defined here is related to other phenomena, such as affective polarization and increased salience of divisive issues.</description>

      <title>NGO Activism: Exposure vs. Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the timing of NGO campaigns to shed light on NGOs' objectives and how their strategies evolve over time. Using data from 2,500 campaigns, we find that NGOs are six times more likely to launch campaigns on their target's Annual General Meeting (AGM) date. Although this strategy increases media exposure and stakeholder scrutiny, resulting in consumer boycotts and related shareholder proposals at the following AGM of the targeted firm, it has no impact on current AGM votes. As NGOs build reputational capital, they adjust their timing to influence AGM votes, revealing the trade-offs they face to drive corporate change.</description>
