      <title>Generalization Error Analysis of Deep Backward Dynamic Programming for Solving Nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method in deep backward dynamic programming (DBDP) (Hure et al. 2020) for numerically solving high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our study focuses on examining the generalization error as a component of the total error in the DBDP framework, discovering that the rate of convergence for the generalization error is influenced by the choice of sampling methods. Specifically, for a given batch size $m$, the generalization error under QMC methods exhibits a convergence rate of $O(m^{-1+\varepsilon})$, where $\varepsilon$ can be made arbitrarily small. This rate is notably more favorable than that of the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which is $O(m^{-1/2+\varepsilon})$. Our theoretical analysis shows that the generalization error under QMC methods achieves a higher order of convergence than their MC counterparts. Numerical experiments demonstrate that QMC indeed surpasses MC in delivering solutions that are both more precise and stable.</description>

      <title>An objective isogeometric mixed finite element formulation for nonlinear elastodynamic beams with incompatible warping strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stable mixed isogeometric finite element formulation for geometrically and materially nonlinear beams in transient elastodynamics, where a Cosserat beam formulation with extensible directors is used. The extensible directors yields a linear configuration space incorporating constant in-plane cross-sectional strains. Higher-order (incompatible) strains are introduced to correct stiffness, whose additional degrees-of-freedom are eliminated by an element-wise condensation. Further, the present discretization of the initial director field leads to the objectivity of approximated strain measures, regardless of the degree of basis functions. For physical stress resultants and strains, we employ a global patch-wise approxiation using B-spline basis functions, whose higher-order continuity enables to use much less degrees-of-freedom, compared to element-wise approximation. For time-stepping, we employ an implicit energy-momentum consistent scheme, which exhibits superior numerical stability in comparison to standard trapezoidal and mid-point rules. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the present method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broad class of nonlinear acoustic wave models possess a Hamiltonian structure in their dissipation-free limit and a gradient flow structure for their dissipative dynamics. This structure may be exploited to design numerical methods which preserve the Hamiltonian structure in the dissipation-free limit, and which achieve the correct dissipation rate in the spatially-discrete dissipative dynamics. Moreover, by using spatial discretizations which preserve the de Rham cohomology, the non-evolving involution constraint for the vorticity may be exactly satisfied for all of time. Numerical examples are given using a mimetic finite difference spatial discretization.</description>

      <title>Randomized Radial Basis Function Neural Network for Solving Multiscale Elliptic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome these obstacles and improve computational accuracy and efficiency, this paper presents the Randomized Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RRNN), an innovative approach explicitly crafted for solving multiscale elliptic equations. The RRNN method commences by decomposing the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains. Within each subdomain, the solution to the localized subproblem is approximated by a randomized radial basis function neural network with a Gaussian kernel. This network is distinguished by the random assignment of width and center coefficients for its activation functions, thereby rendering the training process focused solely on determining the weight coefficients of the output layer. For each subproblem, similar to the Petrov-Galerkin finite element method, a linear system will be formulated on the foundation of a weak formulation. Subsequently, a selection of collocation points is stochastically sampled at the boundaries of the subdomain, ensuring satisfying $C^0$ and $C^1$ continuity and boundary conditions to couple these localized solutions. The network is ultimately trained using the least squares method to ascertain the output layer weights. To validate the RRNN method's effectiveness, an extensive array of numerical experiments has been executed and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and efficiency well.</description>

      <title>Ultraspherical Spectral Method for Block Copolymer Systems on Unit Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate ultraspherical spectral method for the Ohta-Kawasaki (OK) and Nakazawa-Ohta (NO) models in the disk domain, representing diblock and triblock copolymer systems, respectively. We employ ultraspherical spectral discretization for spatial variables in the disk domain and apply the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF) method for temporal discretization. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to develop a numerical method for diblock and triblock copolymer systems with long-range interactions in disk domains. We show the energy stability of the numerical method in both semi-discrete and fully-discrete discretizations. In our numerical experiments, we verify the second-order temporal convergence rate and the energy stability of the proposed methods. Our numerical results show that the coarsening dynamics in diblock copolymers lead to bubble assemblies both inside and on the boundary of the disk. Additionally, in the triblock copolymer system, we observe several novel pattern formations, including single and double bubble assemblies in the unit disk. These findings are detailed through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>AP-MIONet: Asymptotic-preserving multiple-input neural operators for capturing the high-field limits of collisional kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In kinetic equations, external fields play a significant role, particularly when their strength is sufficient to balance collision effects, leading to the so-called high-field regime. Two typical examples are the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP) system in plasma physics and the Boltzmann equation in semiconductor physics. In this paper, we propose a generic asymptotic-preserving multiple-input DeepONet (AP-MIONet) method for solving these two kinetic equations with variable parameters in the high-field regime. Our method aims to tackle two major challenges in this regime: the additional variable parameters introduced by electric fields, and the absence of an explicit local equilibrium, which is a key component of asymptotic-preserving (AP) schemes. We leverage the multiple-input DeepONet (MIONet) architecture to accommodate additional parameters, and formulate the AP loss function by incorporating both the mass conservation law and the original kinetic system. This strategy can avoid reliance on the explicit local equilibrium, preserve the mass and adapt to non-equilibrium states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method through extensive numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional DtN-FEM scattering analysis of SH guided waves by an interface debonding in a double-layered plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a two-dimensional Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) finite element method (FEM) is developed to analyze the scattering of SH guided waves due to an interface delamination in a bi-material plate. During the finite element analysis, it is necessary to determine the far-field DtN conditions at virtual boundaries where both displacements and tractions are unknown. In this study, firstly, the scattered waves at the virtual boundaries are represented by a superposition of guided waves with unknown scattered coefficients. Secondly, utilizing the mode orthogonality, the unknown tractions at virtual boundaries are expressed in terms of the unknown scattered displacements at virtual boundaries via scattered coefficients. Thirdly, this relationship at virtual boundaries can be finally assembled into the global DtN-FEM matrix to solve the problem. This method is simple and elegant, which has advantages on dimension reduction and needs no absorption medium or perfectly matched layer to suppress the reflected waves compared to traditional FEM. Furthermore, the reflection and transmission coefficients of each guided mode can be directly obtained without post-processing. This proposed DtN-FEM will be compared with boundary element method (BEM), and finally validated for several benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Research on Real-time Diagnosis and Early Warning Technology of Automobile Faults Based on Fractional Order Differential Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automobiles have become the main means of transportation for human beings, and their failures in the process of operation are directly related to the life and property safety of drivers. Therefore, automobile fault diagnosis and early warning technologies have become urgent problems in the current academic world. The premise of real-time accurate diagnosis and early warning of automobiles is to obtain high-quality information data in real time, but the automobile operating environment is complex and changeable, resulting in the measured information data under the influence of multiple factors, such as equipment performance and signal interference. There is an unpredictable measurement error, which greatly affects the reliability of fault diagnosis and early warning systems. In this paper, on the basis of studying the structure and operation characteristics of automobiles, we design a method that can be used for real-time diagnosis and early warning of automobile faults; through the study of fractional-order calculus theory, we establish a mathematical model of information data fusion based on fractional-order differential operators. By providing high-quality information data to automobile fault diagnosis and early warning systems, real-time and accurate diagnosis and early warning functions for automobile faults can be realized. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method were verified through an experiment applying the technology in automobile fault diagnosis and early warning. The research results are of great significance for promoting the development of the automobile industry and ensuring the safety of drivers' lives and property.</description>

      <title>XI-DeepONet: An operator learning method for elliptic interface problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific computing has been an indispensable tool in applied sciences and engineering, where traditional numerical methods are often employed due to their superior accuracy guarantees. However, these methods often encounter challenges when dealing with problems involving complex geometries. Machine learning-based methods, on the other hand, are mesh-free, thus providing a promising alternative. In particular, operator learning methods have been proposed to learn the mapping from the input space to the solution space, enabling rapid inference of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) once trained. In this work, we address the parametric elliptic interface problem. Building upon the deep operator network (DeepONet), we propose an extended interface deep operator network (XI-DeepONet). XI-DeepONet exhibits three unique features: (1) The interface geometry is incorporated into the neural network as an additional input, enabling the network to infer solutions for new interface geometries once trained; (2) The level set function associated with the interface geometry is treated as the input, on which the solution mapping is continuous and can be effectively approximated by the deep operator network; (3) The network can be trained without any input-output data pairs, thus completely avoiding the need for meshes of any kind, directly or indirectly. We conduct a comprehensive series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>PFWNN: A deep learning method for solving forward and inverse problems of phase-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field models have been widely used to investigate the phase transformation phenomena. However, it is difficult to solve the problems numerically due to their strong nonlinearities and higher-order terms. This work is devoted to solving forward and inverse problems of the phase-field models by a novel deep learning framework named Phase-Field Weak-form Neural Networks (PFWNN), which is based on the weak forms of the phase-field equations. In this framework, the weak solutions are parameterized as deep neural networks with a periodic layer, while the test function space is constructed by functions compactly supported in small regions. The PFWNN can efficiently solve the phase-field equations characterizing the sharp transitions and identify the important parameters by employing the weak forms. It also allows local training in small regions, which significantly reduce the computational cost. Moreover, it can guarantee the residual descending along the time marching direction, enhancing the convergence of the method. Numerical examples are presented for several benchmark problems. The results validate the efficiency and accuracy of the PFWNN. This work also sheds light on solving the forward and inverse problems of general high-order time-dependent partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Determining a Time-Varying Potential in Time-Fractional Diffusion from Observation at a Single Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the identification of a time-dependent potential in a time-fractional diffusion model from a boundary measurement taken at a single point. Theoretically, we establish a conditional Lipschitz stability for this inverse problem. Numerically, we develop an easily implementable iterative algorithm to recover the unknown coefficient, and also derive rigorous error bounds for the discrete reconstruction. These results are attained by using the (discrete) solution theory of direct problems, and applying error estimates that are optimal with respect to problem data regularity. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Computational and analytical studies of a new nonlocal phase-field crystal model in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlocal phase-field crystal (NPFC) model is presented as a nonlocal counterpart of the local phase-field crystal (LPFC) model and a special case of the structural PFC (XPFC) derived from classical field theory for crystal growth and phase transition. The NPFC incorporates a finite range of spatial nonlocal interactions that can account for both repulsive and attractive effects. The specific form is data-driven and determined by a fitting to the materials structure factor, which can be much more accurate than the LPFC and previously proposed fractional variant. In particular, it is able to match the experimental data of the structure factor up to the second peak, an achievement not possible with other PFC variants studied in the literature. Both LPFC and fractional PFC (FPFC) are also shown to be distinct scaling limits of the NPFC, which reflects the generality. The advantage of NPFC in retaining material properties suggests that it may be more suitable for characterizing liquid-solid transition systems. Moreover, we study numerical discretizations using Fourier spectral methods, which are shown to be convergent and asymptotically compatible, making them robust numerical discretizations across different parameter ranges. Numerical experiments are given in the two-dimensional case to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NPFC in simulating crystal structures and grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate Solver for the Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation with Dirac-Delta Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is a key tool in physics for describing systems influenced by drag forces and Gaussian noise, with applications spanning multiple fields. We consider the fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), which models the time evolution of probability densities for systems driven by L\'evy processes, relevant in scenarios where Gaussian assumptions fail. The paper presents an efficient and accurate numerical approach for the free-space FFPE with constant coefficients and Dirac-delta initial conditions. This method utilizes the integral representation of the solutions and enables the efficient handling of very high-dimensional problems using fast algorithms. Our work is the first to present a high-precision numerical solver for the free-space FFPE with Dirac-delta initial conditions. This opens the door for future research on more complex scenarios, including those with variable coefficients and other types of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid PDE-Deep Neural Network Model for Calcium Dynamics in Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, calcium dynamics in neurons are modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The PDE component focuses on reaction-diffusion processes, while the ODE component addresses transmission via ion channels on the cell's or organelle's membrane. However, analytically determining the underlying equations for ion channels is highly challenging due to the complexity and unknown factors inherent in biological processes. Therefore, we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the open probability of ion channels, a task that can be intricate when approached with ODEs. This technique also reduces the number of unknowns required to model the open probability. When trained with valid data, the same neural network architecture can be used for different ion channels, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. Furthermore, based on the given data, we can build more physiologically reasonable DNN models that can be customized. Subsequently, we integrated the DNN model into calcium dynamics in neurons with endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a hybrid model that combines PDEs and DNNs. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the flexibility and advantages of the PDE-DNN model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a recent characterization of energy-preserving B-series, we derive the explicit conditions on the coefficients of a Runge-Kutta method that ensure energy preservation (for Hamiltonian systems) up to a given order in the step size, which we refer to as the pseudo-energy-preserving (PEP) order. We study explicit Runge-Kutta methods with PEP order higher than their classical order. We provide examples of such methods up to PEP order six, and test them on Hamiltonian ODE and PDE systems. We find that these methods behave similarly to exactly energy-conservative methods over moderate time intervals and exhibit significantly smaller errors, relative to other Runge-Kutta methods of the same order, for moderately long-time simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this report, we discuss a simple model for RGB color and polarization images under a unified framework of quaternion nonnegative matrix factorization (QNMF) and present a hierarchical nonnegative least squares method to solve the factor matrices. The convergence analysis of the algorithm is discussed as well. We test the proposed method in the polarization image and color facial image representation. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical nonnegative least squares method for the QNMF model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following advances in the theory of composites we develop rapidly converging series expansions about $z=\infty$ for the resolvent ${\bf R}(z)=[z{\bf I}-{\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}]^{-1}$ where ${\bf Q}$ is an orthogonal projection and ${\bf P}$ is such that ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf P}={\bf I}$ while $\Gamma={\bf P}{\bf P}^\dagger$ is an orthogonal projection. It is assumed that the spectrum of ${\bf P}^\dagger{\bf Q}{\bf P}$ lies within the interval $[z^-,z^+]$ for some known $z^+\leq 1$ and $z^-\geq 0$. The series converges in the entire $z$-plane excluding the cut $[z^-,z^+]$. It is obtained using subspace substitution, where the desired resolvent is tied to a resolvent in a larger space and ${\bf Q}$ gets replaced by a projection $\underline{\bf Q}$ that is no longer orthogonal.</description>

      <title>Improving Greedy Algorithms for Rational Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When developing robust preconditioners for multiphysics problems, fractional functions of the Laplace operator often arise and need to be inverted. Rational approximation in the uniform norm can be used to convert inverting those fractional operators into inverting a series of shifted Laplace operators. Care must be taken in the approximation so that the shifted Laplace operators remain symmetric positive definite, making them better conditioned. In this work, we study two greedy algorithms for finding rational approximations to such fractional operators. The first algorithm improves the orthogonal greedy algorithm discussed in [Li et al., SISC, 2024] by adding one minimization step in the uniform norm to the procedure. The second approach employs the weak Chebyshev greedy algorithm in the uniform norm. Both methods yield non-increasing error. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, which are also flexible and applicable to other approximation problems. Moreover, with effective rational approximations to the fractional operator, the resulting algorithms show good performance in preconditioning a Darcy-Stokes coupled problem.</description>

      <title>High-order numerical method for solving elliptic partial differential equations on unfitted node sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present how high-order accurate solutions to elliptic partial differential equations can be achieved in arbitrary spatial domains using radial basis function-generated finite differences (RBF-FD) on unfitted node sets (i.e., not adjusted to the domain boundary). In this novel method, we only collocate on nodes interior to the domain boundary and enforce boundary conditions as constraints by means of Lagrange multipliers. This combination enables full geometric flexibility near boundaries without compromising the high-order accuracy of the RBF-FD method. The high-order accuracy and robustness of two formulations of this approach are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems driven by non-linear parabolic partial differential equations with initial condition $\theta$ modelled by a Gaussian process `prior' probability measure. Given discrete samples of the state of the system evolving in space-time, one obtains updated `posterior' measures on a function space containing all possible trajectories. We give a general set of conditions under which these non-Gaussian posterior distributions are approximated, in Wasserstein distance for the supremum-norm metric, by the law of a Gaussian random function. We demonstrate the applicability of our results to periodic non-linear reaction diffusion equations \begin{align*} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u - \Delta u &amp;= f(u) \\ u(0) &amp;= \theta \end{align*} where $f$ is any smooth and compactly supported reaction function. In this case the limiting Gaussian measure can be characterised as the solution of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with `rough' Gaussian initial conditions whose covariance operator we describe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rational approximation has proven to be a powerful method for solving two-dimensional (2D) fluid problems. At small Reynolds numbers, 2D Stokes flows can be represented by two analytic functions, known as Goursat functions. Xue, Waters and Trefethen [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46 (2024), pp. A1214-A1234] recently introduced the LARS algorithm (Lightning-AAA Rational Stokes) for computing 2D Stokes flows in general domains by approximating the Goursat functions using rational functions. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for computing 2D Stokes flows in periodic channels using trigonometric rational functions, with poles placed via the AAA-LS algorithm [Costa and Trefethen, European Congr. Math., 2023] in a conformal map of the domain boundary. We apply the algorithm to Poiseuille and Couette problems between various periodic channel geometries, where solutions are computed to at least 6-digit accuracy in less than 1 second. The applicability of the algorithm is highlighted in the computation of the dynamics of fluid particles in unsteady Couette flows.</description>

      <title>Reduced Effectiveness of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Functions with Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been observed that even a small amount of noise introduced into the dataset can significantly degrade the performance of KAN. In this brief note, we aim to quantitatively evaluate the performance when noise is added to the dataset. We propose an oversampling technique combined with denoising to alleviate the impact of noise. Specifically, we employ kernel filtering based on diffusion maps for pre-filtering the noisy data for training KAN network. Our experiments show that while adding i.i.d. noise with any fixed SNR, when we increase the amount of training data by a factor of $r$, the test-loss (RMSE) of KANs will exhibit a performance trend like $\text{test-loss} \sim \mathcal{O}(r^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ as $r\to +\infty$. We conclude that applying both oversampling and filtering strategies can reduce the detrimental effects of noise. Nevertheless, determining the optimal variance for the kernel filtering process is challenging, and enhancing the volume of training data substantially increases the associated costs, because the training dataset needs to be expanded multiple times in comparison to the initial clean data. As a result, the noise present in the data ultimately diminishes the effectiveness of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>

      <title>Hemispheroidal parameterization and harmonic decomposition of simply connected open surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral analysis of open surfaces is gaining momentum for studying surface morphology in engineering, computer graphics, and medical domains. This analysis is enabled using proper parameterization approaches on the target analysis domain. In this paper, we propose the usage of customizable parameterization coordinates that allow mapping open surfaces into oblate or prolate hemispheroidal surfaces. For this, we proposed the usage of Tutte, conformal, area-preserving, and balanced mappings for parameterizing any given simply connected open surface onto an optimal hemispheroid. The hemispheroidal harmonic bases were introduced to spectrally expand these parametric surfaces by generalizing the known hemispherical ones. This approach uses the radius of the hemispheroid as a degree of freedom to control the size of the parameterization domain of the open surfaces while providing numerically stable basis functions. Several open surfaces have been tested using different mapping combinations. We also propose optimization-based mappings to serve various applications on the reconstruction problem. Altogether, our work provides an effective way to represent and analyze simply connected open surfaces.</description>

      <title>Cross-diffusion systems coupled via a moving interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a one-dimensional model which consists of two cross-diffusion systems coupled via a moving interface. The motivation stems from the modelling of complex diffusion processes in the context of the vapor deposition of thin films. In our model, cross-diffusion of the various chemical species can be respectively modelled by a size-exclusion system for the solid phase and the Stefan-Maxwell system for the gaseous phase. The coupling between the two phases is modelled by linear phase transition laws of Butler-Volmer type, resulting in an interface evolution. The continuous properties of the model are investigated, in particular its entropy variational structure and stationary states. We introduce a two-point flux approximation finite volume scheme. The moving interface is addressed with a moving-mesh approach, where the mesh is locally deformed around the interface. The resulting discrete nonlinear system is shown to admit a solution that preserves the main properties of the continuous system, namely: mass conservation, nonnegativity, volume-filling constraints, decay of the free energy and asymptotics. In particular, the moving-mesh approach is compatible with the entropy structure of the continuous model. Numerical results illustrate these properties and the dynamics of the model.</description>

      <title>Three types of quasi-Trefftz functions for the 3D convected Helmholtz equation: construction and approximation properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trefftz methods are numerical methods for the approximation of solutions to boundary and/or initial value problems. They are Galerkin methods with particular test and trial functions, which solve locally the governing partial differential equation (PDE). This property is called the Trefftz property. Quasi-Trefftz methods were introduced to leverage the advantages of Trefftz methods for problems governed by variable coefficient PDEs, by relaxing the Trefftz property into a so-called quasi-Trefftz property: test and trial functions are not exact solutions but rather local approximate solutions to the governing PDE. In order to develop quassi-Trefftz methods for aero-acoustics problems governed by the convected Helmholtz equation, the present work tackles the question of the definition, construction and approximation properties of three families of quasi-Trefftz functions: two based on generalizations on plane wave solutions, and one polynomial. The polynomial basis shows significant promise as it does not suffer from the ill-conditioning issue inherent to wave-like bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, two-dimensional finite element complexes with various levels of smoothness, including the de Rham complex, the curldiv complex, the elasticity complex, and the divdiv complex, are systematically constructed. Smooth scalar finite elements in two dimensions are developed based on a non-overlapping decomposition of the simplicial lattice and the Bernstein basis of the polynomial space, with the order of differentiability at vertices being greater than twice that at edges. Finite element de Rham complexes with different levels of smoothness are devised using smooth finite elements with smoothness parameters that satisfy certain relations. Finally, finite element elasticity complexes and finite element divdiv complexes are derived from finite element de Rham complexes by using the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) framework. This study is the first work to construct finite element complexes in a systematic way. Moreover, the novel tools developed in this work, such as the non-overlapping decomposition of the simplicial lattice and the discrete BGG construction, can be useful for further research in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel barycentric interpolation algorithm designed for analytic functions $f\in\mathcal{A}(E)$ defined on the complex plane. The algorithm, which encompasses both polynomial and rational interpolation, is tailored to handle singularities near $E$. Our method is applicable to regions $E$ bounded by piecewise smooth Jordan curves, and it imposes no connectivity restrictions on the region. The key feature of our approach lies in efficiently computing discrete points via the numerical solution of Symm's integral equation, enabling the construction of polynomial or rational barycentric interpolants. Furthermore, our method provides relevant parameters for the equilibrium potential, such as Robin's constant, which can be used to estimate convergence rates. Numerical experiments demonstrate the convergence rate achieved by our method in comparison to the theoretical convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Optimal approximation of infinite-dimensional holomorphic functions II: recovery from i.i.d. pointwise samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite-dimensional, holomorphic functions have been studied in detail over the last several decades, due to their relevance to parametric differential equations and computational uncertainty quantification. The approximation of such functions from finitely many samples is of particular interest, due to the practical importance of constructing surrogate models to complex mathematical models of physical processes. In a previous work, [5] we studied the approximation of so-called Banach-valued, $(\boldsymbol{b},\varepsilon)$-holomorphic functions on the infinite-dimensional hypercube $[-1,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ from $m$ (potentially adaptive) samples. In particular, we derived lower bounds for the adaptive $m$-widths for classes of such functions, which showed that certain algebraic rates of the form $m^{1/2-1/p}$ are the best possible regardless of the sampling-recovery pair. In this work, we continue this investigation by focusing on the practical case where the samples are pointwise evaluations drawn identically and independently from a probability measure. Specifically, for Hilbert-valued $(\boldsymbol{b},\varepsilon)$-holomorphic functions, we show that the same rates can be achieved (up to a small polylogarithmic or algebraic factor) for essentially arbitrary tensor-product Jacobi (ultraspherical) measures. Our reconstruction maps are based on least squares and compressed sensing procedures using the corresponding orthonormal Jacobi polynomials. In doing so, we strengthen and generalize past work that has derived weaker nonuniform guarantees for the uniform and Chebyshev measures (and corresponding polynomials) only. We also extend various best $s$-term polynomial approximation error bounds to arbitrary Jacobi polynomial expansions. Overall, we demonstrate that i.i.d.\ pointwise samples are near-optimal for the recovery of infinite-dimensional, holomorphic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical resolution of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs remains a huge challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. Starting from the weak formulation of the Lawson-Euler scheme, this paper proposes a stochastic particle method (SPM) by tracking the deterministic motion, random jump, resampling and reweighting of particles. Real-valued weighted particles are adopted by SPM to approximate the high-dimensional solution, which automatically adjusts the point distribution to intimate the relevant feature of the solution. A piecewise constant reconstruction with virtual uniform grid is employed to evaluate the nonlinear terms, which fully exploits the intrinsic adaptive characteristic of SPM. Combining both, SPM can achieve the goal of adaptive sampling in time. Numerical experiments on the 6-D Allen-Cahn equation and the 7-D Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman equation demonstrate the potential of SPM in solving high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs efficiently while maintaining an acceptable accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The paper addresses the challenge of constructing conforming finite element spaces for high-order differential operators in high dimensions, with a focus on the curl div operator in three dimensions. Tangential-normal continuity is introduced in order to develop distributional finite element curl div complexes. The spaces constructed are applied to discretize a quad curl problem, demonstrating optimal order of convergence. Furthermore, a hybridization technique is proposed, demonstrating its equivalence to nonconforming finite elements and weak Galerkin methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acoustic wave equation is solved in time domain with a boundary element formulation. The time discretisation is performed with the generalised convolution quadrature method and for the spatial approximation standard lowest order elements are used. Collocation and Galerkin methods are applied. In the interest of increasing the efficiency of the boundary element method, a low-rank approximation such as the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) is carried out. We discuss about a generalisation of the ACA to approximate a three-dimensional array of data, i.e., usual boundary element matrices at several complex frequencies. This method is used within the generalised convolution quadrature (gCQ) method to obtain a real time domain formulation. The behaviour of the proposed method is studied with three examples, a unit cube, a unit cube with a reentrant corner, and a unit ball. The properties of the method are preserved in the data sparse representation and a significant reduction in storage is obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a multiscale method for the acoustic wave equation in highly oscillatory media. We use a higher-order extension of the localized orthogonal decomposition method combined with a higher-order time stepping scheme and present rigorous a-priori error estimates in the energy-induced norm. We find that in the very general setting without additional assumptions on the coefficient beyond boundedness, arbitrary orders of convergence cannot be expected but that increasing the polynomial degree may still considerably reduce the size of the error. Under additional regularity assumptions, higher orders can be obtained as well. Numerical examples are presented that confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic spectral properties and preconditioning of an approximated nonlocal Helmholtz equation with Caputo fractional Laplacian and variable coefficient wave number $\mu$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current study investigates the asymptotic spectral properties of a finite difference approximation of nonlocal Helmholtz equations with a Caputo fractional Laplacian and a variable coefficient wave number $\mu$, as it occurs when considering a wave propagation in complex media, characterized by nonlocal interactions and spatially varying wave speeds. More specifically, by using tools from Toeplitz and generalized locally Toeplitz theory, the present research delves into the spectral analysis of nonpreconditioned and preconditioned matrix-sequences. We report numerical evidences supporting the theoretical findings. Finally, open problems and potential extensions in various directions are presented and briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Energy-Decreasing Exponential Time Differencing Runge-Kutta methods for Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general framework for constructing higher-order, unconditionally energy-stable exponential time differencing Runge-Kutta methods applicable to a range of gradient flows. Specifically, we identify conditions sufficient for ETDRK schemes to maintain the original energy dissipation. Our analysis reveals that commonly used third-order and fourth-order ETDRK schemes fail to meet these conditions. To address this, we introduce new third-order ETDRK schemes, designed with appropriate stabilization, which satisfy these conditions and thus guarantee the unconditional energy decaying property. We conduct extensive numerical experiments with these new schemes to verify their accuracy, stability, behavior under large time steps, long-term evolution, and adaptive time stepping strategy across various gradient flows. This study is the first to examine the unconditional energy stability of high-order ETDRK methods, and we are optimistic that our framework will enable the development of ETDRK schemes beyond the third order that are unconditionally energy stable.</description>

      <title>Energy-consistent Petrov-Galerkin time discretization of port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a general class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems we develop a high-order time discretization scheme with certain structure preservation properties. The finite or infinite-dimensional system under consideration possesses a Hamiltonian function, which represents an energy in the system and is conserved or dissipated along solutions. For infinite-dimensional systems this structure is preserved under suitable Galerkin discretization in space. The numerical scheme is energy-consistent in the sense that the Hamiltonian of the approximate solutions at time grid points behaves accordingly. This structure preservation property is achieved by specific design of a continuous Petrov-Galerkin (cPG) method in time. It coincides with standard cPG methods in special cases, in which the latter are energy-consistent. Examples of port-Hamiltonian ODEs and PDEs are presented to visualize the framework. In numerical experiments the energy consistency is verified and the convergence behavior is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a finite volume scheme for the scalar conservation law $\partial_t u + \partial_x (H(x, u)) = 0$ with bounded initial condition for a wide class of flux function $H$, convex with respect to the second variable. The main idea for the construction of the scheme is to use the theory of discontinuous flux. We prove that the resulting approximating sequence converges boundedly almost everywhere on $\mathopen]0, +\infty\mathclose[$ to the entropy solution.</description>

      <title>SOC-MartNet: A Martingale Neural Network for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation without Explicit inf H in Stochastic Optimal Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a martingale-based neural network, SOC-MartNet, for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations where no explicit expression is needed for the infimum of the Hamiltonian, \inf_{u \in U} H(t,x,u, z,p), and stochastic optimal control problems (SOCPs) with controls on both drift and volatility. We reformulate the HJB equations for the value function by training two neural networks, one for the value function and one for the optimal control with the help of two stochastic processes - a Hamiltonian process and a cost process. The control and value networks are trained such that the associated Hamiltonian process is minimized to satisfy the minimum principle of a feedback SOCP, and the cost process becomes a martingale, thus, ensuring the value function network as the solution to the corresponding HJB equation. Moreover, to enforce the martingale property for the cost process, we employ an adversarial network and construct a loss function characterizing the projection property of the conditional expectation condition of the martingale. Numerical results show that the proposed SOC-MartNet is effective and efficient for solving HJB-type equations and SOCPs with a dimension up to 2000 in a small number of epochs (less than 20) or stochastic gradient method iterations (less than 2000) for the training.</description>

      <title>About the Burton-Miller factor in the low frequency region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Burton-Miller method is a widely used approach in acoustics to enhance the stability of the boundary element method for exterior Helmholtz problems at so-called critical frequencies. This method depends on a coupling parameter $\eta$ and it can be shown that as long as $\eta$ has an imaginary part different from 0, the boundary integral formulation for the Helmholtz equation has a unique solution at all frequencies. A popular choice for this parameter is $\eta = \frac{\mathrm{i}}{k}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. It can be shown that this choice is quasi optimal, at least in the high frequency limit. However, especially in the low frequency region, where the critical frequencies are still sparsely distributed, different choices for this factor result in a smaller condition number and a smaller error of the solution. In this work, alternative choices for this factor are compared based on numerical experiments. Additionally, a way to enhance the Burton-Miller solution with $\eta = \frac{\mathrm{i}}{k}$ for a sound hard scatterer in the low frequency region by an additional step of a modified Richardson iteration is introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyze a structure-preserving method for the approximation of solutions to nonlinear cross-diffusion systems, which combines a Local Discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization with the backward Euler time stepping scheme. The proposed method makes use of the underlying entropy structure of the system, expressing the main unknown in terms of the entropy variable by means of a nonlinear transformation. Such a transformation allows for imposing the physical positivity or boundedness constraints on the approximate solution in a strong sense. Moreover, nonlinearities do not appear explicitly within differential operators or interface terms in the scheme, which significantly improves its efficiency and ease its implementation. We prove the existence of discrete solutions and their asymptotic convergence to a weak solution to the continuous problem. Numerical results for some one- and two-dimensional problems illustrate the accuracy and entropy stability of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based partial differential equation(PDE) solvers have received much attention in the past few years. Methods of this category can solve a wide range of PDEs with high accuracy, typically by transforming the problems into highly nonlinear optimization problems of neural network parameters. This work reviews several deep learning solvers proposed a few years ago, including PINN, WAN, DRM, and VPINN. Numerical results are provided to make comparisons amongst them and address the importance of loss formulation and the optimization method. A rigorous error analysis for PINN is also presented. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and bottlenecks of these methods.</description>

Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds play an essential role in the design and analysis of spectral algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new method to deduce matrix perturbation bounds, which we call "contour bootstrapping". As applications, we work out several new bounds for eigensubspace computation and low rank approximation. Next, we use these bounds to study utility problems in the area of differential privacy.</description>

      <title>A Payne-Whitham model of urban traffic networks in the presence of traffic lights and its application to traffic optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban road transport is a major civilisational and economic challenge, affecting the quality of life and economic activity. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach and sustainable urban planning strategies to mitigate the negative effects of traffic in cities. In this paper, we introduce an extension of one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation models, the Payne-Whitham model. We investigate how this model, originally designed to model highway traffic on straight road segments, can be adapted to more realistic conditions with arbitrary road network graphs and multiple intersections with traffic signals. Furthermore, we showcase the practical application of this extension in experiments aimed at optimising traffic signal settings. For computational reasons, these experiments involve the adoption of surrogate models for approximating our extended Payne-Whitham model, and subsequently, we utilise the Differential Evolution optimization algorithm, resulting in the identification of traffic signal settings that enhance the average speed of cars and decrease the total length of queues, thereby facilitating smoother traffic flow.</description>

      <title>CoLoRA: Continuous low-rank adaptation for reduced implicit neural modeling of parameterized partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces reduced models based on Continuous Low Rank Adaptation (CoLoRA) that pre-train neural networks for a given partial differential equation and then continuously adapt low-rank weights in time to rapidly predict the evolution of solution fields at new physics parameters and new initial conditions. The adaptation can be either purely data-driven or via an equation-driven variational approach that provides Galerkin-optimal approximations. Because CoLoRA approximates solution fields locally in time, the rank of the weights can be kept small, which means that only few training trajectories are required offline so that CoLoRA is well suited for data-scarce regimes. Predictions with CoLoRA are orders of magnitude faster than with classical methods and their accuracy and parameter efficiency is higher compared to other neural network approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence rate of various first-order optimization algorithms is a pivotal concern within the numerical optimization community, as it directly reflects the efficiency of these algorithms across different optimization problems. Our goal is making a significant step forward in the formal mathematical representation of optimization techniques using the Lean4 theorem prover. We first formalize the gradient for smooth functions and the subgradient for convex functions on a Hilbert space, laying the groundwork for the accurate formalization of algorithmic structures. Then, we extend our contribution by proving several properties of differentiable convex functions that have not yet been formalized in Mathlib. Finally, a comprehensive formalization of these algorithms is presented. These developments are not only noteworthy on their own but also serve as essential precursors to the formalization of a broader spectrum of numerical algorithms and their applications in machine learning as well as many other areas.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Probability Flow ODE for Score-based Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for sampling high-dimensional probability distributions. Despite their effectiveness, their theoretical underpinnings remain relatively underdeveloped. In this work, we study the convergence properties of deterministic samplers based on probability flow ODEs from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Assuming access to $L^2$-accurate estimates of the score function, we prove the total variation between the target and the generated data distributions can be bounded above by $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2})$ in the continuous time level, where $d$ denotes the data dimension and $\delta$ represents the $L^2$-score matching error. For practical implementations using a $p$-th order Runge-Kutta integrator with step size $h$, we establish error bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2} + d\cdot(dh)^p)$ at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical studies on problems up to 128 dimensions to verify our theory.</description>

Abstract: We set up, at the abstract Hilbert space setting, the general question on when an inverse linear problem induced by an operator of Friedrichs type admits solutions belonging to (the closure of) the Krylov subspace associated to such operator. Such Krylov solvability of abstract Friedrichs systems allows to predict when, for concrete differential inverse problems, truncation algorithms can or cannot reproduce the exact solutions in terms of approximants from the Krylov subspace.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed active learning with simultaneous weak-form latent space dynamics identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametric greedy latent space dynamics identification (gLaSDI) framework has demonstrated promising potential for accurate and efficient modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear physical systems. However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors. Compared with the high-fidelity models, WgLaSDI achieves 121 to 1,779x speed-up.</description>
