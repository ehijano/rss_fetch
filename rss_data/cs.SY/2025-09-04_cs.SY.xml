      <title>Rollout-Based Approximate Dynamic Programming for MDPs with Information-Theoretic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a finite-horizon Markov decision problem with information-theoretic constraints, where the goal is to minimize directed information from the controlled source process to the control process, subject to stage-wise cost constraints, aiming for an optimal control policy. We propose a new way of approximating a solution for this problem, which is known to be formulated as an unconstrained MDP with a continuous information-state using Q-factors. To avoid the computational complexity of discretizing the continuous information-state space, we propose a truncated rollout-based backward-forward approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework. Our approach consists of two phases: an offline base policy approximation over a shorter time horizon, followed by an online rollout lookahead minimization, both supported by provable convergence guarantees. We supplement our theoretical results with a numerical example where we demonstrate the cost improvement of the rollout method compared to a previously proposed policy approximation method, and the computational complexity observed in executing the offline and online phases for the two methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid dynamical systems modeling of power systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</description>

      <title>An overview of Koopman-based control: From error bounds to closed-loop guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling nonlinear dynamical systems remains a central challenge in a wide range of applications, particularly when accurate first-principle models are unavailable. Data-driven approaches offer a promising alternative by designing controllers directly from observed trajectories. A wide range of data-driven methods relies on the Koopman-operator framework that enables linear representations of nonlinear dynamics via lifting into higher-dimensional observable spaces. Finite-dimensional approximations, such as extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and its controlled variants, make prediction and feedback control tractable but introduce approximation errors that must be accounted for to provide rigorous closed-loop guarantees. This survey provides a systematic overview of Koopman-based control, emphasizing the connection between data-driven surrogate models generated from finite data, approximation errors, controller design, and closed-loop guarantees. We review theoretical foundations, error bounds, and both linear and bilinear EDMD-based control schemes, highlighting robust strategies that ensure stability and performance. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions at the interface of operator theory, approximation theory, and nonlinear control.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Gradient-Based Deployment Strategy for a Network of Sensors with a Probabilistic Sensing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed gradient-based deployment strategy to maximize coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with probabilistic sensing. Leveraging Voronoi partitioning, the overall coverage is reformulated as a sum of local contributions, enabling mobile sensors to optimize their positions using only local information. The strategy adopts the Elfes model to capture detection uncertainty and introduces a dynamic step size based on the gradient of the local coverage, ensuring movements adaptive to regional importance. Obstacle awareness is integrated via visibility constraints, projecting sensor positions to unobstructed paths. A threshold-based decision rule ensures movement occurs only for sufficiently large coverage gains, with convergence achieved when all sensors and their neighbors stop at a local maximum configuration. Simulations demonstrate improved coverage over static deployments, highlighting scalability and practicality for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Approximate constrained stochastic optimal control via parameterized input inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate methods to solve stochastic optimal control (SOC) problems have received significant interest from researchers in the past decade. Probabilistic inference approaches to SOC have been developed to solve nonlinear quadratic Gaussian problems. In this work, we propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based inference procedure to generate state-feedback controls for constrained SOC problems. We consider the inequality constraints for the state and controls and also the structural constraints for the controls. We employ barrier functions to address state and control constraints. We show that the expectation step leads to smoothing of the state-control pair while the the maximization step on the non-zero subsets of the control parameters allows inference of structured stochastic optimal controllers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on unicycle obstacle avoidance, four-unicycle formation control, and quadcopter navigation in windy environment examples. In these examples, we perform an empirical study on the parametric effect of barrier functions on the state constraint satisfaction. We also present a comparative study of smoothing algorithms on the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decision-Making Strategy Considering User Satisfaction Feedback in Demand Response Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand response providers (DRPs) are intermediaries between the upper-level distribution system operator and the lower-level participants in demand response (DR) programs. Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term. The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our proposed solution algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spiking control systems for soft robotics: a rhythmic case study in a soft robotic crawler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by spiking neural feedback, we propose a spiking controller for efficient locomotion in a soft robotic crawler. Its bistability, akin to neural fast positive feedback, combined with a sensorimotor slow negative feedback loop, generates rhythmic spiking. The closed-loop system is robust through the quantized actuation, and negative feedback ensures efficient locomotion with minimal external tuning. We prove that peristaltic waves arise from a supercritical Hopf bifurcation controlled by the sensorimotor gain. Dimensional analysis reveals a separation of mechanical and electrical timescales, and Geometric Singular Perturbation analysis explains endogenous crawling through relaxation oscillations. We further formulate and analytically solve an optimization problem in the singularly perturbed regime, proving that crawling at mechanical resonance maximizes speed by a matching of neuromechanical scales. Given the importance and ubiquity of rhythms and waves in soft-bodied locomotion, we envision that spiking control systems could be utilized in a variety of soft-robotic morphologies and modular distributed architectures, yielding significant robustness, adaptability, and energetic gains across scales.</description>

      <title>On the Smart Coordination of Flexibility Scheduling in Multi-carrier Integrated Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating the interactions between flexibility assets in multi-carrier integrated energy systems (MIES) can lead to an efficient integration of variable renewable energy resources, and a cost-efficient energy transition. However, the proliferation of flexibility assets and their participation in active demand response increases the complexity of coordinating these interactions. This paper introduces different approaches to model the coordination of flexibility scheduling in MIES. We propose a market auction-inspired model coupling approach to address the challenges of preserving the autonomy and privacy of flexibility providers, and the issue of scalability. We benchmark our approach against co-optimization and an iterative price-response method by conducting experiments with varying problem sizes and computing infrastructure. We show that our approach scales well and is suitable for modeling flexibility in large-scale energy systems in a more realistic way. From an optimality standpoint, the flexibility dispatch schedules and electricity prices are ``near-optimal". Our methodology is implemented as a new open-source software, which offers several practical applications. For example, flexibility providers and network operators can couple their models to simulate the interaction between their systems without disclosing confidential information; policy regulators can use it to investigate new market design and regulations to optimize the utilization of flexibility in MIES.</description>

      <title>Target Enclosing Control for Nonholonomic Multi-Agent Systems with Connectivity Maintenance and Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the moving target enclosing control problem for nonholonomic multi-agent systems with guaranteed network connectivity and collision avoidance. We propose a novel control scheme to handle distance constraints imposed by the agents' limited interaction ranges and collision-free thresholds. By leveraging a Henneberg construction method, we innovatively formulate the target enclosing requirements within an isostatic distance-based formation framework, facilitating the integration of distance constraints. Compared with existing results, our approach ensures the positive definiteness of the underlying rigidity matrix and does not require controlling the target's motion. To eliminate the occurrences of control singularities caused by nonholonomic constraints, we propose a fixed-time angular control law using barrier Lyapunov functions. Additionally, we develop a linear velocity control law using the prescribed performance control approach and transformed error constraints. We rigorously prove that our control laws enable the multi-agent system to asymptotically achieve the desired angular formation pattern around a moving target while satisfying the established distance constraints. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hidden Convexity in Active Learning: A Convexified Online Input Design for ARX Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to accelerate the identification of an unknown ARX system from trajectory data through online input design. Specifically, we present an active learning algorithm that sequentially selects the input to excite the system according to an experiment design criterion using the past measured data. The adopted criterion yields a non-convex optimization problem, but we provide an exact convex reformulation allowing to find the global optimizer in a computationally tractable way. Moreover, we give sample complexity bounds on the estimation error due to the stochastic noise. Numerical studies showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm and the benefits of the convex reformulation.</description>

      <title>Tangential Action Spaces: Geometry, Memory and Cost in Holonomic and Nonholonomic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much energy must an embodied agent spend to remember its past actions? We present Tangential Action Spaces (TAS), a differential-geometric framework revealing a fundamental trade-off between memory and energy in embodied agents. By modeling agents as hierarchical manifolds with projections Phi: P -&gt; C and Psi: C -&gt; I connecting physical (P), cognitive (C), and intentional (I) spaces, we show that the geometry of Phi dictates both memory mechanisms and their energetic costs. Our main contributions are: (1) a rigorous classification proving that one-to-one projections (diffeomorphisms) require engineered dynamics for memory while many-to-one projections (fibrations) enable intrinsic geometric memory through connection curvature; (2) a proof that any deviation from the energy-minimal lift incurs a quantifiable penalty, establishing that path-dependent behavior necessarily costs energy; and (3) a universal principle that excess cost Delta E scales with the square of accumulated holonomy (geometric memory). We validate this cost-memory duality through five systems: the strip-sine system (engineered memory, Delta E proportional to (Delta h)^2), helical and twisted fibrations (intrinsic geometric memory), and flat/cylindrical fibrations (proving curvature, not topology, creates memory). This framework bridges geometric mechanics and embodied cognition, explaining biological motor diversity and providing design principles for efficient robotic control.</description>

      <title>Globally Asymptotically Stable Trajectory Tracking of Underactuated UAVs using Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs Geometric Algebra (GA) tools to model the dynamics of objects in 3-dimensional space, serving as a proof of concept to facilitate control design for trajectory tracking in underactuated systems. For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</description>

      <title>Introducing LCOAI: A Standardized Economic Metric for Evaluating AI Deployment Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes foundational to enterprise infrastructure, organizations face growing challenges in accurately assessing the full economic implications of AI deployment. Existing metrics such as API token costs, GPU-hour billing, or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) fail to capture the complete lifecycle costs of AI systems and provide limited comparability across deployment models. This paper introduces the Levelized Cost of Artificial Intelligence (LCOAI), a standardized economic metric designed to quantify the total capital (CAPEX) and operational (OPEX) expenditures per unit of productive AI output, normalized by valid inference volume. Analogous to established metrics like LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and LCOH (levelized cost of hydrogen) in the energy sector, LCOAI offers a rigorous, transparent framework to evaluate and compare the cost-efficiency of vendor API deployments versus self-hosted, fine-tuned models. We define the LCOAI methodology in detail and apply it to three representative scenarios, OpenAI GPT-4.1 API, Anthropic Claude Haiku API, and a self-hosted LLaMA-2-13B deployment demonstrating how LCOAI captures critical trade-offs in scalability, investment planning, and cost optimization. Extensive sensitivity analyses further explore the impact of inference volume, CAPEX, and OPEX variability on lifecycle economics. The results illustrate the practical utility of LCOAI in procurement, infrastructure planning, and automation strategy, and establish it as a foundational benchmark for AI economic analysis. Policy implications and areas for future refinement, including environmental and performance-adjusted cost metrics, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Proximal Descent Method for Minimizing Weakly Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing a $m$-weakly convex and possibly nonsmooth function. Weak convexity provides a broad framework that subsumes convex, smooth, and many composite nonconvex functions. In this work, we propose a $\textit{proximal descent method}$, a simple and efficient first-order algorithm that combines the inexact proximal point method with classical convex bundle techniques. Our analysis establishes explicit non-asymptotic convergence rates in terms of $(\eta,\epsilon)$-inexact stationarity. In particular, the method finds an $(\eta,\epsilon)$-inexact stationary point using at most $\mathcal{O}\!\left( \Big(\tfrac{1}{\eta^2} + \tfrac{1}{\epsilon}\Big) \max\!\left\{\tfrac{1}{\eta^2}, \tfrac{1}{\epsilon}\right\} \right)$ function value and subgradient evaluations. Consequently, the algorithm also achieves the best-known complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\delta^4)$ for finding an approximate Moreau stationary point with $\|\nabla f_{2m}(x)\|\leq \delta$. A distinctive feature of our method is its \emph{automatic adaptivity}: with no parameter tuning or algorithmic modification, it accelerates to $\mathcal{O}(1/\delta^2)$ complexity under smoothness and further achieves linear convergence under quadratic growth. Overall, this work bridges convex bundle methods and weakly convex optimization, while providing accelerated guarantees under structural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Improving the Resilience of Quadrotors in Underground Environments by Combining Learning-based and Safety Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations, and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to `out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety of the safety controller (avoiding collision).</description>

      <title>Event Detection and Classification for Long Range Sensing of Elephants Using Seismic Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average (STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments. Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73% in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.</description>

      <title>Population-aware Online Mirror Descent for Mean-Field Games with Common Noise by Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer Digital Twin System for Future Mobile Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the upcoming 6G era, the communication networks are expected to face unprecedented challenges in terms of complexity and dynamics. Digital Twin (DT) technology, with its various digital capabilities, holds great potential to facilitate the transformation of the communication network from passive responding to proactive adaptation. Thus, in this paper, we propose a multi-layer DT system that coordinates local DT, edge DT, and cloud DT for future network architecture and functions. In our vision, the proposed DT system will not only achieve real-time data-driven decision-making and digital agent functions previously handled by centralized DT, but will do so in a more distributed, mobile, layer-by-layer manner. Moreover, it will supply essential data, pre-trained models, and open interfaces for future metaverse applications, enabling creators and users to efficiently develop and experience metaverse services.</description>

      <title>Forbal: Force Balanced 2-5 Degree of Freedom Robot Manipulator Built from a Five Bar Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A force balanced manipulator design based on the closed chain planar five bar linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to 5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles.
  We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66\%, a reduction of average joint torques of up to 79\%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass, the joint torques are reduced up to 84\% for the balanced configuration. Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.</description>

      <title>Vibration Damping in Underactuated Cable-suspended Artwork -- Flying Belt Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refurbishment of the interactive robotic art installation Standards and Double Standards by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. The installation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each actuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking system that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system was limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like vibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive responsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved significant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed mathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately capture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control design. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem, was implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and faster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in system performance and audience interaction. This work exemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive art, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control and vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations.</description>

      <title>Parallel-Constraint Model Predictive Control: Exploiting Parallel Computation for Improving Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Anomaly Detection for 5G O-RAN Performance Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing reliance of critical services on network infrastructure coupled with the increased operational complexity of beyond-5G/6G networks necessitate the need for proactive and automated network fault management. The provision for open interfaces among different radio access network\,(RAN) elements and the integration of AI/ML into network architecture enabled by the Open RAN\,(O-RAN) specifications bring new possibilities for active network health monitoring and anomaly detection. In this paper we leverage these advantages and develop an anomaly detection framework that proactively detect the possible throughput drops for a UE and minimize the post-handover failures. We propose two actionable anomaly detection algorithms tailored for real-world deployment. The first algorithm identifies user equipment (UE) at risk of severe throughput degradation by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as resource block utilization and signal quality metrics, enabling proactive handover initiation. The second algorithm evaluates neighbor cell radio coverage quality, filtering out cells with anomalous signal strength or interference levels. This reduces candidate targets for handover by 41.27\% on average. Together, these methods mitigate post-handover failures and throughput drops while operating much faster than the near-real-time latency constraints. This paves the way for self-healing 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Cost-Optimized Systems Engineering for IoT-Enabled Robot Nurse in Infectious Pandemic Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utilization of robotic technology has gained traction in healthcare facilities due to progress in the field that enables time and cost savings, minimizes waste, and improves patient care. Digital healthcare technologies that leverage automation, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, have the potential to enhance the sustainability and profitability of healthcare systems in the long run. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need for cyber-physical robots to automate check-ups and medication administration. A robot nurse is controlled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and can serve as an automated medical assistant while also allowing supervisory control based on custom commands. This system helps reduce infection risk and improves outcomes in pandemic settings. This research presents a test case with a nurse robot that can assess a patient's health status and take action accordingly. We also evaluate the system's performance in medication administration, health-status monitoring, and life-cycle considerations.</description>

      <title>On the Perturbed Projection-Based Distributed Gradient-Descent Algorithm: A Fully-Distributed Adaptive Redesign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit a classical distributed gradient-descent algorithm, introducing an interesting class of perturbed multi-agent systems. The state of each subsystem represents a local estimate of a solution to the global optimization problem. Thereby, the network is required to minimize local cost functions, while gathering the local estimates around a common value. Such a complex task suggests the interplay of consensus-based dynamics with gradient-descent dynamics. The latter descent dynamics involves the projection operator, which is assumed to provide corrupted projections of a specific form, reminiscent of existing (fast) projection algorithms. Hence, for the resulting class of perturbed networks, we are able to adaptively tune some gains in a fully distributed fashion, to approach the optimal consensus set up to arbitrary-desired precision.</description>

      <title>Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</description>

      <title>Preventing Inactive CBF Safety Filters Caused by Invalid Relative Degree Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier function (CBF) safety filters emerged as a popular framework to certify and modify potentially unsafe control inputs, for example, provided by a reinforcement learning agent or a non-expert user. Typical CBF safety filter designs assume that the system has a uniform relative degree. This assumption is restrictive and is frequently overlooked in practice. When violated, the assumption can cause the safety filter to become inactive, allowing large and possibly unsafe control inputs to be applied to the system. In discrete-time implementations, the inactivity issue is often manifested as chattering close to the safety boundary and/or constraint violations. In this work, we provide an in-depth discussion on the safety filter inactivity issue, propose a mitigation strategy based on multiple CBFs, and derive an upper bound on the sampling time for safety under sampled-data control. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated through both simulation and quadrotor experiments.</description>

Abstract: We develop a hierarchical control architecture for autonomous docking maneuvers of a dynamic positioning vessel and provide formal safety guarantees. At the upper-level, we treat the vessel's desired surge, sway, and yaw velocities as control inputs and synthesize a symbolic controller in real-time. The desired velocities are then executed by the vessel's low-level velocity feedback control loop. We next investigate methods to optimize the performance of the proposed control scheme. The results are evaluated on a simulation model of a marine surface vessel in the presence of static obstacles and, for the first time, through physical experiments on a scale model vessel.</description>

Abstract: Finding a positive state-space realization with the minimum dimension for a given transfer function is an open problem in control theory. In this paper, we focus on positive realizations in Markov form and propose a linear programming approach that computes them with a minimum dimension. Such minimum dimension of positive Markov realizations is an upper bound of the minimal positive realization dimension.

      <title>Transformer-Based Power Optimization for Max-Min Fairness in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power allocation is an important task in wireless communication networks. Classical optimization algorithms and deep learning methods, while effective in small and static scenarios, become either computationally demanding or unsuitable for large and dynamic networks with varying user loads. This letter explores the potential of transformer-based deep learning models to address these challenges. We propose a transformer neural network to jointly predict optimal uplink and downlink power using only user and access point positions. The max-min fairness problem in cell-free massive multiple input multiple output systems is considered. Numerical results show that the trained model provides near-optimal performance and adapts to varying numbers of users and access points without retraining, additional processing, or updating its neural network architecture. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving robust and flexible power allocation for dynamic networks.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Distributed Energy Resources with Nodal Pricing in Distribution Networks: a Game-Theoretic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a real-time nodal pricing mechanism for cost minimization and voltage control in a distribution network with autonomous distributed energy resources and analyze the resulting market using stochastic game theory. Unlike existing methods, the proposed pricing scheme does not require device-aware centralized coordination or communication between prosumers. By developing new sufficient conditions under which a stochastic game is a Markov potential game, we show that the problem of computing an equilibrium for the proposed model is equivalent to solving a single-agent Markov Decision Process. These new conditions are general and may apply to other applications. We compute the equilibrium for an IEEE test system to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the pricing policy.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function Synthesis for Nonlinear Systems with Dual Relative Degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for synthesizing safe control actions; however, constructing CBFs remains difficult for general nonlinear systems. In this work, we provide a constructive framework for synthesizing CBFs for systems with dual relative degree -- where different inputs influence the outputs at two different orders of differentiation; this is common in systems with orientation-based actuation, such as unicycles and quadrotors. In particular, we propose dual relative degree CBFs (DRD-CBFs) and show that these DRD-CBFs can be constructively synthesized and used to guarantee system safety. Our method constructs DRD-CBFs by leveraging the dual relative degree property -- combining a CBF for an integrator chain with a Lyapunov function certifying the tracking of safe inputs generated for this linear system. We apply these results to dual relative degree systems, both in simulation and experimentally on hardware using quadruped and quadrotor robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation with Multi-Team Collaboration Based on Hamilton's Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-team collaboration strategy based on Hamilton's rule from ecology that facilitates resource allocation among multiple teams, where agents are considered as shared resource among all teams that must be allocated appropriately. We construct an algorithmic framework that allows teams to make bids for agents that consider the costs and benefits of transferring agents while also considering relative mission importance for each team. This framework is applied to a multi-team coverage control mission to demonstrate its effectiveness. It is shown that the necessary criteria of a mission evaluation function are met by framing it as a function of the locational coverage cost of each team with respect to agent gain and loss, and these results are illustrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Update-Aware Robust Optimal Model Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust optimal or min-max model predictive control (MPC) approaches aim to guarantee constraint satisfaction over a known, bounded uncertainty set while minimizing a worst-case performance bound. Traditionally, these methods compute a trajectory that meets the desired properties over a fixed prediction horizon, apply a portion of the resulting input, and then re-solve the MPC problem using newly obtained measurements at the next time step. However, this approach fails to account for the fact that the control trajectory will be updated in the future, potentially leading to conservative designs. In this paper, we present a novel update-aware robust optimal MPC algorithm for decreasing horizon problems on nonlinear systems that explicitly accounts for future control trajectory updates. This additional insight allows our method to provably expand the feasible solution set and guarantee improved worst-case performance bounds compared to existing techniques. Our approach formulates the trajectory generation problem as a sequence of nested existence-constrained semi-infinite programs (SIPs), which can be efficiently solved using local reduction techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate our approach on a planar quadrotor problem, where it clearly outperforms an equivalent method that does not account for future updates at the cost of increased computation time.</description>

      <title>Smooth Logic Constraints in Nonlinear Optimization and Optimal Control Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some optimal control problems, complex relationships between states and inputs cannot be easily represented using continuous constraints, necessitating the use of discrete logic instead. This paper presents a method for incorporating such logic constraints directly within continuous optimization frameworks, eliminating the need for binary variables or specialized solvers. Our approach reformulates arbitrary logic constraints under minimal assumptions as max-min constraints, which are then smoothed by introducing auxiliary variables into the optimization problem. When these reformulated constraints are satisfied, they guarantee that the original logical conditions hold, ensuring correctness in the optimization process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on two planar quadrotor control tasks with complex logic constraints. Compared to existing techniques for encoding logic in continuous optimization, our approach achieves faster computational performance and improved convergence to feasible solutions.</description>

      <title>DMPC-Swarm: Distributed Model Predictive Control on Nano UAV Swarms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming vital to our society, undertaking tasks such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. A special variant of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has emerged as a promising approach for the safe management of these swarms by combining the scalability of distributed computation with dynamic swarm motion control. In this DMPC method, multiple agents solve local optimization problems with coupled anti-collision constraints, periodically exchanging their solutions. Despite its potential, existing methodologies using this DMPC variant have yet to be deployed on distributed hardware that fully utilize true distributed computation and wireless communication. This is primarily due to the lack of a communication system tailored to meet the unique requirements of mobile swarms and an architecture that supports distributed computation while adhering to the payload constraints of UAVs. We present DMPC-SWARM, a new swarm control methodology that integrates an efficient, stateless low-power wireless communication protocol with a novel DMPC algorithm that provably avoids UAV collisions even under message loss. By utilizing event-triggered and distributed off-board computing, DMPC-SWARM supports nano UAVs, allowing them to benefit from additional computational resources while retaining scalability and fault tolerance. In a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that DMPC-SWARM guarantees collision avoidance under realistic conditions, including communication delays and message loss. Finally, we present DMPC-SWARM's implementation on a swarm of up to 16 nano-quadcopters, demonstrating the first realization of these DMPC variants with computation distributed on multiple physical devices interconnected by a real wireless mesh networks. A video showcasing DMPC-SWARM is available at http://tiny.cc/DMPCSwarm.</description>

      <title>Task and Motion Planning of Dynamic Systems using Hyperproperties for Signal Temporal Logics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for dynamical systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.</description>

      <title>Cost-Driven Representation Learning for Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control: Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning state representations from potentially high-dimensional observations, with the goal of controlling an unknown partially observable system. We pursue a cost-driven approach, where a dynamic model in some latent state space is learned by predicting the costs without predicting the observations or actions. In particular, we focus on an intuitive cost-driven state representation learning method for solving Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, one of the most fundamental partially observable control problems. As our main results, we establish finite-sample guarantees of finding a near-optimal state representation function and a near-optimal controller using the directly learned latent model, for finite-horizon time-varying LQG control problems. To the best of our knowledge, despite various empirical successes, finite-sample guarantees of such a cost-driven approach remain elusive. Our result underscores the value of predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to our theory, and notably also an idea that is known to be empirically valuable for learning state representations. A second part of this work, that is to appear as Part II, addresses the infinite-horizon linear time-invariant setting; it also extends the results to an approach that implicitly learns the latent dynamics, inspired by the recent empirical breakthrough of MuZero in model-based reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>The Nah Bandit: Modeling User Non-compliance in Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems now pervade the digital world, ranging from advertising to entertainment. However, it remains challenging to implement effective recommendation systems in the physical world, such as in mobility or health. This work focuses on a key challenge: in the physical world, it is often easy for the user to opt out of taking any recommendation if they are not to her liking, and to fall back to her baseline behavior. It is thus crucial in cyber-physical recommendation systems to operate with an interaction model that is aware of such user behavior, lest the user abandon the recommendations altogether. This paper thus introduces the Nah Bandit, a tongue-in-cheek reference to describe a Bandit problem where users can say `nah' to the recommendation and opt for their preferred option instead. As such, this problem lies in between a typical bandit setup and supervised learning. We model the user non-compliance by parameterizing an anchoring effect of recommendations on users. We then propose the Expert with Clustering (EWC) algorithm, a hierarchical approach that incorporates feedback from both recommended and non-recommended options to accelerate user preference learning. In a recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ clusters, EWC achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$, achieving superior theoretical performance in the short term compared to LinUCB algorithm. Experimental results also highlight that EWC outperforms both supervised learning and traditional contextual bandit approaches. This advancement reveals that effective use of non-compliance feedback can accelerate preference learning and improve recommendation accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future research in Nah Bandit, providing a robust framework for more effective recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</description>

      <title>A State Alignment-Centric Approach to Federated System Identification: The FedAlign Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents FedAlign, a Federated Learning (FL) framework particularly designed for System Identification (SYSID) tasks by aligning state representations. Local workers can learn State-Space Models (SSMs) with equivalent representations but different dynamics. We demonstrate that directly aggregating these local SSMs via FedAvg results in a global model with altered system dynamics. FedAlign overcomes this problem by employing similarity transformation matrices to align state representations of local SSMs, thereby establishing a common parameter basin that retains the dynamics of local SSMs. FedAlign computes similarity transformation matrices via two distinct approaches: FedAlign-A and FedAlign-O. In FedAlign-A, we represent the global SSM in controllable canonical form (CCF). We apply control theory to analytically derive similarity transformation matrices that convert each local SSM into this form. Yet, establishing global SSM in CCF brings additional alignment challenges in multi input - multi output SYSID as CCF representation is not unique, unlike in single input - single output SYSID. In FedAlign-O, we address these alignment challenges by reformulating the local parameter basin alignment problem as an optimization task. We determine the parameter basin of a local worker as the common parameter basin and solve least square problems to obtain similarity transformation matrices needed to align the remaining local SSMs. Through the experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that FedAlign outperforms FedAvg, converges faster, and provides improved stability of the global SSM thanks to the efficient alignment of local parameter basins.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to examples of heat and wave equations, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

Abstract: The reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) communities have developed vast ecosystems of theoretical approaches and computational tools for solving optimal control problems. Given their conceptual similarities but differing strengths, there has been increasing interest in synergizing RL and MPC. However, existing approaches tend to be limited for various reasons, including computational cost of MPC in an RL algorithm and software hurdles towards seamless integration of MPC and RL tools. These challenges often result in the use of "simple" MPC schemes or RL algorithms, neglecting the state-of-the-art in both areas. This paper presents MPCritic, a machine learning-friendly architecture that interfaces seamlessly with MPC tools. MPCritic utilizes the loss landscape defined by a parameterized MPC problem, focusing on "soft" optimization over batched training steps; thereby updating the MPC parameters while avoiding costly minimization and parametric sensitivities. Since the MPC structure is preserved during training, an MPC agent can be readily used for online deployment, where robust constraint satisfaction is paramount. We demonstrate the versatility of MPCritic, in terms of MPC architectures and RL algorithms that it can accommodate, on classic control benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Improving Bayesian Optimization for Portfolio Management with an Adaptive Scheduling</title>

Abstract: Existing black-box portfolio management systems are prevalent in the financial industry due to commercial and safety constraints, though their performance can fluctuate dramatically with changing market regimes. Evaluating these non-transparent systems is computationally expensive, as fixed budgets limit the number of possible observations. Therefore, achieving stable and sample-efficient optimization for these systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework (TPE-AS) that improves search stability and efficiency for black-box portfolio models under these limited observation budgets. Standard Bayesian optimization, which solely maximizes expected return, can yield erratic search trajectories and misalign the surrogate model with the true objective, thereby wasting the limited evaluation budget. To mitigate these issues, we propose a weighted Lagrangian estimator that leverages an adaptive schedule and importance sampling. This estimator dynamically balances exploration and exploitation by incorporating both the maximization of model performance and the minimization of the variance of model observations. It guides the search from broad, performance-seeking exploration towards stable and desirable regions as the optimization progresses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies, which establish our proposed method as the primary approach and other configurations as baselines, demonstrate its effectiveness across four backtest settings with three distinct black-box portfolio management models.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Data-Driven Framework for Linear Quadratic Output Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear quadratic regulator with unmeasurable states and unknown system matrix parameters better aligns with practical scenarios. However, for this problem, balancing the optimality of the resulting controller and the leniency of the algorithm's feasibility conditions remains a non-trivial challenge, as no well-established general method has yet been developed to address this trade-off. To address this gap, this study first develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for state parameterization that equivalently substitutes for unknown states. By analyzing the controllability of consistent systems satisfied by substitute states, this framework quantifies the capability of substitute state data matrices to parameterize unknown closed-loop systems and output feedback controllers, thereby constructing a modified state parameterization form that meets the complete data parameterization condition of Willems' Fundamental Lemma. Leveraging this framework, this study proposes efficient model-free off-policy policy iteration and value iteration algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve for the optimal output feedback controller. Compared with existing studies, particularly for multi-output problems where existing model-free reinforcement learning algorithms may fail, the proposed method removes redundant information in substitute states and the additional full row rank condition on regression matrices, thereby ensuring the solution of optimal output feedback controllers equivalent to optimal state feedback controllers for multi-output systems. Furthermore, this study pioneers a comprehensive and highly scalable theoretical analysis of state parameterization from a data-driven viewpoint, and the proposed algorithms exhibit significant advantages in implementation conditions, data demand, unknown handling, and convergence speed.</description>
