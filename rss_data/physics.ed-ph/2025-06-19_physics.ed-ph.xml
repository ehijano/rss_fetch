      <title>Young TIM: A wave-optics simulator with slightly special powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave optics is a prominent part of the undergraduate physics curriculum, and many undergraduate labs contain experiments on wave optics. In our 3rd-year undergraduate lab, we run numerical simulations alongside the experiments (and when pandemic restrictions did not allow students into the lab, those simulations replaced some experiments). We use Young TIM, an interactive wave-optics simulator designed to be a research tool that can also be used for the dissemination of our research and for education. It has novel and unique features, including the ability to create an anaglyph of the beam as it would be seen in 3D by a binocular, probably misguided, observer staring into the beam. Here we describe how to use Young TIM, and we describe several possible numerical experiments suitable for undergraduate teaching.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and general relativity (GR) in upper secondary school through new targeted teaching materials: a study on student learning and motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmology and GR remain largely inaccessible to high-school teaching due to the advanced prerequisites to master these topics. Integrating them into upper secondary teaching is a significant challenge that remains unresolved. This contribution reports on an implementation study of a GR and cosmology course for upper secondary school students as part of an educational project launched during the centenary of GR and tested ever since for several years. The course aimed to expand students' knowledge to include current physics topics while highlighting their foundations in areas of classical physics such as Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and waves. Targeted teaching and learning materials are focused on conceptual and qualitative understanding, while systematically combined with a mathematical treatment accessible at the upper secondary level, avoiding oversimplification. A key element is an active learning approach, incorporating activities and tasks such as engaging applications related to current research, reflective exercises, thought experiments, and hands-on tasks. The main research objective was to explore whether a conceptually deep and educationally effective GR and cosmology course could be successfully implemented for non-specialist upper secondary students. A pre-post study assessed both conceptual learning and affective outcomes, including interest, curiosity, self-concept, and perceived relevance of science. Results showed encouraging gains in both learning and motivation, with large to very large effect sizes for conceptual learning of core principles. Additionally, no or small effects of predictors such as gender were observed. We conclude that the integration of GR and cosmology into upper secondary physics teaching, in the form of courses and materials that are engaging, comprehensible, and impactful, is feasible.</description>
