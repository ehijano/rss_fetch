      <title>On Middle Grounds for Preference Statements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In group decisions or deliberations, stakeholders are often confronted with conflicting opinions. We investigate a logic-based way of expressing such opinions and a formal general notion of a middle ground between stakeholders. Inspired by the literature on preferences with hierarchical and lexicographic models, we instantiate our general framework to the case where stakeholders express their opinions using preference statements of the form I prefer 'a' to 'b', where 'a' and 'b' are alternatives expressed over some attributes, e.g., in a trolley problem, one can express I prefer to save 1 adult and 1 child to 2 adults (and 0 children). We prove theoretical results on the existence and uniqueness of middle grounds. In particular, we show that, for preference statements, middle grounds may not exist and may not be unique. We also provide algorithms for deciding the existence and finding middle grounds.</description>

      <title>Reasoning About Knowledge on Regular Expressions is 2EXPTIME-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.</description>

      <title>Verifying Quantized Graph Neural Networks is PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the verification of quantized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where some fixed-width arithmetic is used to represent numbers. We introduce the linear-constrained validity (LVP) problem for verifying GNNs properties, and provide an efficient translation from LVP instances into a logical language. We show that LVP is in PSPACE, for any reasonable activation functions. We provide a proof system. We also prove PSPACE-hardness, indicating that while reasoning about quantized GNNs is feasible, it remains generally computationally challenging.</description>

      <title>Distributed Triangle Detection is Hard in Few Rounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the distributed triangle detection problem, we have an $n$-vertex network $G=(V,E)$ with one player for each vertex of the graph who sees the edges incident on the vertex. The players communicate in synchronous rounds using the edges of this network and have a limited bandwidth of $O(\log{n})$ bits over each edge. The goal is to detect whether or not $G$ contains a triangle as a subgraph in a minimal number of rounds.
  We prove that any protocol (deterministic or randomized) for distributed triangle detection requires $\Omega(\log\log{n})$ rounds of communication. Prior to our work, only one-round lower bounds were known for this problem.
  The primary technique for proving these types of distributed lower bounds is via reductions from two-party communication complexity. However, it has been known for a while that this approach is provably incapable of establishing any meaningful lower bounds for distributed triangle detection. Our main technical contribution is a new information theoretic argument which combines recent advances on multi-pass graph streaming lower bounds with the point-to-point communication aspects of distributed models, and can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The vast world of quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to identify quantum advantages lies at the heart of quantum technology. While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision, distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation, learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties: predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee. While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.</description>
