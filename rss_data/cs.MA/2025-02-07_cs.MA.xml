      <title>Optimistic {\epsilon}-Greedy Exploration for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm is widely used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, due to the representational limitations of traditional monotonic value decomposition methods, algorithms can underestimate optimal actions, leading policies to suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration, focusing on enhancing exploration to correct value estimations. The underestimation arises from insufficient sampling of optimal actions during exploration, as our analysis indicated. We introduce an optimistic updating network to identify optimal actions and sample actions from its distribution with a probability of $\epsilon$ during exploration, increasing the selection frequency of optimal actions. Experimental results in various environments reveal that the Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration effectively prevents the algorithm from suboptimal solutions and significantly improves its performance compared to other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Speaking the Language of Teamwork: LLM-Guided Credit Assignment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit assignment, the process of attributing credit or blame to individual agents for their contributions to a team's success or failure, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly in environments with sparse rewards. Commonly-used approaches such as value decomposition often lead to suboptimal policies in these settings, and designing dense reward functions that align with human intuition can be complex and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel framework where a large language model (LLM) generates dense, agent-specific rewards based on a natural language description of the task and the overall team goal. By learning a potential-based reward function over multiple queries, our method reduces the impact of ranking errors while allowing the LLM to evaluate each agent's contribution to the overall task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and higher policy returns compared to state-of-the-art MARL baselines.</description>

      <title>PAGNet: Pluggable Adaptive Generative Networks for Information Completion in Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For partially observable cooperative tasks, multi-agent systems must develop effective communication and understand the interplay among agents in order to achieve cooperative goals. However, existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with communication methods lack evaluation metrics for information weights and information-level communication modeling. This causes agents to neglect the aggregation of multiple messages, thereby significantly reducing policy learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose pluggable adaptive generative networks (PAGNet), a novel framework that integrates generative models into MARL to enhance communication and decision-making. PAGNet enables agents to synthesize global states representations from weighted local observations and use these representations alongside learned communication weights for coordinated decision-making. This pluggable approach reduces the computational demands typically associated with the joint training of communication and policy networks. Extensive experimental evaluations across diverse benchmarks and communication scenarios demonstrate the significant performance improvements achieved by PAGNet. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent communication patterns and the quality of generated global states, providing insights into operational mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Fairness Aware Reinforcement Learning via Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent systems (MAS) focuses on equitable reward distribution among agents in scenarios involving sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status. This paper introduces fairness in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a penalty term derived from demographic parity, counterfactual fairness, and conditional statistical parity. The proposed method balances reward maximisation with fairness by integrating two penalty components: a retrospective component that minimises disparities in past outcomes and a prospective component that ensures fairness in future decision-making. We evaluate our approach in the Allelopathic Harvest game, a cooperative and competitive MAS focused on resource collection, where some agents possess a sensitive attribute. Experiments demonstrate that fair-PPO achieves fairer policies across all fairness metrics than classic PPO. Fairness comes at the cost of reduced rewards, namely the Price of Fairness, although agents with and without the sensitive attribute renounce comparable amounts of rewards. Additionally, the retrospective and prospective penalties effectively change the agents' behaviour and improve fairness. These findings underscore the potential of fair-PPO to address fairness challenges in MAS.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of selecting $k$ representative nodes from a network, aiming to achieve two objectives: identifying the most influential nodes and ensuring the selection proportionally reflects the network's diversity. We propose two approaches to accomplish this, analyze them theoretically, and demonstrate their effectiveness through a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>Noncooperative Equilibrium Selection via a Trading-based Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncooperative multi-agent systems often face coordination challenges due to conflicting preferences among agents. In particular, agents acting in their own self-interest can settle on different equilibria, leading to suboptimal outcomes or even safety concerns. We propose an algorithm named trading auction for consensus (TACo), a decentralized approach that enables noncooperative agents to reach consensus without communicating directly or disclosing private valuations. TACo facilitates coordination through a structured trading-based auction, where agents iteratively select choices of interest and provably reach an agreement within an a priori bounded number of steps. A series of numerical experiments validate that the termination guarantees of TACo hold in practice, and show that TACo achieves a median performance that minimizes the total cost across all agents, while allocating resources significantly more fairly than baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Online Learning Efficiency Through Heterogeneous Resource Integration with a Multi-Agent RAG System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient online learning requires seamless access to diverse resources such as videos, code repositories, documentation, and general web content. This poster paper introduces early-stage work on a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System designed to enhance learning efficiency by integrating these heterogeneous resources. Using specialized agents tailored for specific resource types (e.g., YouTube tutorials, GitHub repositories, documentation websites, and search engines), the system automates the retrieval and synthesis of relevant information. By streamlining the process of finding and combining knowledge, this approach reduces manual effort and enhances the learning experience. A preliminary user study confirmed the system's strong usability and moderate-high utility, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency of knowledge acquisition.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Counter Categories and Ratings in PvP Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In competitive games, strength ratings like Elo are widely used to quantify player skill and support matchmaking by accounting for skill disparities better than simple win rate statistics. However, scalar ratings cannot handle complex intransitive relationships, such as counter strategies seen in Rock-Paper-Scissors. To address this, recent work introduced Neural Rating Table and Neural Counter Table, which combine scalar ratings with discrete counter categories to model intransitivity. While effective, these methods rely on neural network training and cannot perform real-time updates. In this paper, we propose an online update algorithm that extends Elo principles to incorporate real-time learning of counter categories. Our method dynamically adjusts both ratings and counter relationships after each match, preserving the explainability of scalar ratings while addressing intransitivity. Experiments on zero-sum competitive games demonstrate its practicality, particularly in scenarios without complex team compositions.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Architecture Search via Agentic Supernet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered multi-agent systems extend the cognitive boundaries of individual agents through disciplined collaboration and interaction, while constructing these systems often requires labor-intensive manual designs. Despite the availability of methods to automate the design of agentic workflows, they typically seek to identify a static, complex, one-size-fits-all system, which, however, fails to dynamically allocate inference resources based on the difficulty and domain of each query. To address this challenge, we shift away from the pursuit of a monolithic agentic system, instead optimizing the \textbf{agentic supernet}, a probabilistic and continuous distribution of agentic architectures. We introduce MaAS, an automated framework that samples query-dependent agentic systems from the supernet, delivering high-quality solutions and tailored resource allocation (\textit{e.g.}, LLM calls, tool calls, token cost). Comprehensive evaluation across six benchmarks demonstrates that MaAS \textbf{(I)} requires only $6\sim45\%$ of the inference costs of existing handcrafted or automated multi-agent systems, \textbf{(II)} surpasses them by $0.54\%\sim11.82\%$, and \textbf{(III)} enjoys superior cross-dataset and cross-LLM-backbone transferability.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Risk Metrics for Systemically Safe AI: Gatekeeping Multi-Agent Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Free Energy Principle as a foundation for measuring risk in agentic and multi-agent systems. From these principles we introduce a Cumulative Risk Exposure metric that is flexible to differing contexts and needs. We contrast this to other popular theories for safe AI that hinge on massive amounts of data or describing arbitrarily complex world models. In our framework, stakeholders need only specify their preferences over system outcomes, providing straightforward and transparent decision rules for risk governance and mitigation. This framework naturally accounts for uncertainty in both world model and preference model, allowing for decision-making that is epistemically and axiologically humble, parsimonious, and future-proof. We demonstrate this novel approach in a simplified autonomous vehicle environment with multi-agent vehicles whose driving policies are mediated by gatekeepers that evaluate, in an online fashion, the risk to the collective safety in their neighborhood, and intervene through each vehicle's policy when appropriate. We show that the introduction of gatekeepers in an AV fleet, even at low penetration, can generate significant positive externalities in terms of increased system safety.</description>

      <title>DECAF: Learning to be Fair in Multi-agent Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of resource allocation problems operate under resource constraints that are managed by a central arbitrator, with agents who evaluate and communicate preferences over these resources. We formulate this broad class of problems as Distributed Evaluation, Centralized Allocation (DECA) problems and propose methods to learn fair and efficient policies in centralized resource allocation. Our methods are applied to learning long-term fairness in a novel and general framework for fairness in multi-agent systems. We show three different methods based on Double Deep Q-Learning: (1) A joint weighted optimization of fairness and utility, (2) a split optimization, learning two separate Q-estimators for utility and fairness, and (3) an online policy perturbation to guide existing black-box utility functions toward fair solutions. Our methods outperform existing fair MARL approaches on multiple resource allocation domains, even when evaluated using diverse fairness functions, and allow for flexible online trade-offs between utility and fairness.</description>

      <title>G-Designer: Architecting Multi-agent Communication Topologies via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated that collective intelligence can significantly surpass the capabilities of individual agents, primarily due to well-crafted inter-agent communication topologies. Despite the diverse and high-performing designs available, practitioners often face confusion when selecting the most effective pipeline for their specific task: \textit{Which topology is the best choice for my task, avoiding unnecessary communication token overhead while ensuring high-quality solution?} In response to this dilemma, we introduce G-Designer, an adaptive, efficient, and robust solution for multi-agent deployment, which dynamically designs task-aware, customized communication topologies. Specifically, G-Designer models the multi-agent system as a multi-agent network, leveraging a variational graph auto-encoder to encode both the nodes (agents) and a task-specific virtual node, and decodes a task-adaptive and high-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks showcase that G-Designer is: \textbf{(1) high-performing}, achieving superior results on MMLU with accuracy at $84.50\%$ and on HumanEval with pass@1 at $89.90\%$; \textbf{(2) task-adaptive}, architecting communication protocols tailored to task difficulty, reducing token consumption by up to $95.33\%$ on HumanEval; and \textbf{(3) adversarially robust}, defending against agent adversarial attacks with merely $0.3\%$ accuracy drop.</description>

      <title>Scenario-Based Curriculum Generation for Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The automated generation of diverse and complex training scenarios has been an important ingredient in many complex learning tasks. Especially in real-world application domains, such as autonomous driving, auto-curriculum generation is considered vital for obtaining robust and general policies. However, crafting traffic scenarios with multiple, heterogeneous agents is typically considered as a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in more complex simulation environments. In our work, we introduce MATS-Gym, a Multi-Agent Traffic Scenario framework to train agents in CARLA, a high-fidelity driving simulator. MATS-Gym is a multi-agent training framework for autonomous driving that uses partial scenario specifications to generate traffic scenarios with variable numbers of agents. This paper unifies various existing approaches to traffic scenario description into a single training framework and demonstrates how it can be integrated with techniques from unsupervised environment design to automate the generation of adaptive auto-curricula. The code is available at https://github.com/AutonomousDrivingExaminer/mats-gym.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor Distortion Mechanisms for $k$-Committee Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the $k$-committee election problem, we wish to aggregate the preferences of $n$ agents over a set of alternatives and select a committee of $k$ alternatives that minimizes the cost incurred by the agents. While we typically assume that agent preferences are captured by a cardinal utility function, in many contexts we only have access to ordinal information, namely the agents' rankings over the outcomes. As preference rankings are not as expressive as cardinal utilities, a loss of efficiency is inevitable, and is quantified by the notion of \emph{distortion}.
  We study the problem of electing a $k$-committee that minimizes the sum of the $\ell$-largest costs incurred by the agents, when agents and candidates are embedded in a metric space. This problem is called the $\ell$-centrum problem and captures both the utilitarian and egalitarian objectives. When $k \geq 2$, it is not possible to compute a bounded-distortion committee using purely ordinal information. We develop the first algorithms (that we call mechanisms) for the $\ell$-centrum problem (when $k \geq 2$), which achieve $O(1)$-distortion while eliciting only a very limited amount of cardinal information via value queries. We obtain two types of query-complexity guarantees: $O(\log k \log n)$ queries \emph{per agent}, and $O(k^2 \log^2 n)$ queries \emph{in total} (while achieving $O(1)$-distortion in both cases). En route, we give a simple adaptive-sampling algorithm for the $\ell$-centrum $k$-clustering problem.</description>

      <title>Containment Control Approach for Steering Opinion in a Social Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the problem of steering multi-dimensional opinion in a social network. Assuming the society of desire consists of stubborn and regular agents, stubborn agents are considered as leaders who specify the desired opinion distribution as a distributed reward or utility function. In this context, each regular agent is seen as a follower, updating its bias on the initial opinion and influence weights by averaging their observations of the rewards their influencers have received. Assuming random graphs with reducible and irreducible topology specify the influences on regular agents, opinion evolution is represented as a containment control problem in which stability and convergence to the final opinion are proven.</description>
