      <title>BAGELS: A General Method for Minimizing the Rate of Radiative Depolarization in Electron Storage Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for minimizing the effects of radiative depolarization in electron storage rings by use of vertical orbit bumps in the arcs. Electron polarization is directly characterized by the RMS of the so-called spin orbit coupling function in the bends. In the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), as was the case in HERA, this function is excited by the spin rotators. Individual vertical corrector coils in the arcs can have varying impacts on this function globally. In this method, we use a singular value decomposition of the response matrix of the spin-orbit coupling function with each coil to define a minimal number of most effective groups of coils, motivating the name "Best Adjustment Groups for ELectron Spin" (BAGELS) method. The BAGELS method can be used to minimize the depolarizing effects in an ideal lattice, and to obtain fine-tuning knobs to restore the minimization in rings with realistic closed orbit distortions. Furthermore, the least effective groups can instead be chosen for other applications where no impact on polarization is desirable, e.g. global coupling compensation or vertical emittance creation. Application of the BAGELS method has significantly increased the polarization in simulations of the 18 GeV ESR, beyond achievable with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional theory of superradiant free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

      <title>A new method to measure the unloaded quality factor of superconducting cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an method that measures the unloaded quality factor $Q_0$, the external quality factor $Q_E$, and the cavity detuning $\Delta\omega$ with a recursive least-squares algorithm. It combines a large number of consecutive measurements to successively improve an estimate of fit parameters that asymptotically converges to the ``real'' values. Exploiting the large amount of data acquired by a digital low-level RF system permits us to reach this asymptotic regime in a moderate time frame of seconds to minutes. Simulations show that the method works both for critically coupled and over-coupled cavities. A new calibration method adresses very tight tolerances of the method on system parameters.</description>
