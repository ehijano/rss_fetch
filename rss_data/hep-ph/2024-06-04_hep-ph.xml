      <title>$J/\psi$ photoproduction and polarization in $e+p$ collisions in the improved color evaporation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the production and polarization of direct $J/\psi$ in the improved color evaporation model in $e+p$ photoproduction. We present the production as functions of transverse momentun, mass of the hadronic final state, and inelasticity. We also present the polarization parameters $\lambda_\vartheta$, $\lambda_{\varphi}$, and $\lambda_{\vartheta \varphi}$ in the helicity and the Collins-Soper frames, as well as the frame-invariant polarization parameter $\tilde{\lambda}$ as a function of transverse momentum and inelasticity. We find agreement with both $J/\psi$ unpolarized cross sections and the invariant polarization parameters as a function of $p_T$.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis in exponential $f(R)$ gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that gravitational leptogenesis with dynamical $CPT$ breaking in an expanding universe can be reconciled with exponential $f(R)$ gravity models with axion as cold dark matter. For $L$ violating interactions, we consider both non-supersymmetric model with heavy right handed neutrino decay and supersymmetric model with sneutrino decay. For both the cases, we have shown that the required baryonis asymmetry could be obtained and also have shown the variation of decoupling temperature for lepton number violating interactions with $\beta$ parameter in exponential $f(R)$ gravity. Lepton number violating model parameters are contrained with $\beta$ through decoupling temperature. Upper bound on $\beta$ parameter is also obtained.</description>

      <title>The flavor invariants of the $\nu$SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixty years after the experimental discovery of CP violation in the quark sector, the existence of a similar CP violation in the lepton sector is still to be established. Actually, the structure of such a violation depends crucially on the origin of the neutrino masses. In an attempt at categorizing the leptonic sources of CP violation, we studied the $\nu$SM, the Standard Model extended with three generations of sterile neutrinos, that can interpolate continuously between the Dirac and Majorana scenarios of neutrino masses. In particular, we perform a classification of the Jarlskog-like flavor invariants entering CP-violating observables and we study their suppression with the heavy Majorana mass in the seesaw limit of the model. To simplify the construction of the invariants, we introduce a graph-based method. With the guidance of the Hilbert series and plethystic logarithm of the theory, we construct the \emph{generating} and \emph{primary} sets of invariants for the $\nu$SM for the first time. Unlike in the Standard Model and some other theories, we find that the numbers of generating invariants and the syzygies among them cannot immediately be read off from the plethystic logarithm, but require a more careful examination. Our analysis reveals that the \emph{generating} set contains 459 invariants, out of which 208 are CP-even and 251 are CP-odd. In the seesaw limit of the $\nu$SM, we show that all parameters of the UV theory can be captured in the effective theory with a certain suppression with the heavy Majorana mass, while these parameters can only appear in a \emph{flavor-invariant} way with a \emph{higher} mass suppression. Furthermore, we discuss how the necessary and sufficient conditions for CP violation can be captured by utilizing these invariants. Along the way, we present useful algorithms to enumerate and build the flavor invariants.</description>

      <title>Formation and decay of oscillons after inflation in the presence of an external coupling, Part-I: Lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and decay of oscillons during the post-inflationary reheating epoch from inflaton oscillations around asymptotically flat potentials $V(\varphi)$ in the presence of an external coupling of the form $\frac{1}{2}\, g^2 \, \varphi^2 \, \chi^2$. It is well-known that in the absence of such an external coupling, the attractive self-interaction term in the potential leads to the formation of copious amounts of long-lived oscillons both for symmetric and asymmetric plateau potentials. We perform a detailed numerical analysis to study the formation of oscillons in the $\alpha$-attractor E- and T-model potentials using the publicly available lattice simulation code ${\cal C}$osmo${\cal L}$attice. We observe the formation of nonlinear oscillon-like structures with the average equation of state $\langle w_\varphi\rangle \simeq 0$ for a range of values of the inflaton self-coupling $\lambda$ and the external coupling $g^2$. Our results demonstrate that oscillons form even in the presence of an external coupling and we determine the upper bound on $g^2$ which facilitates oscillon formation. We also find that eventually, these oscillons decay into the scalar inflaton radiation as well as into the quanta of the offspring field $\chi$. Thus, we establish the possibility that reheating could have proceeded through the channel of oscillon decay, along with the usual decay of the oscillating inflaton condensate into $\chi$ particles. For a given value of the self-coupling $\lambda$, we notice that the lifetime of a population of oscillons decreases with an increase in the strength of the external coupling, following an (approximately) inverse power-law dependence on $g^2$.</description>

      <title>Cutting the Scotogenic loop: Adding flavor to Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for hybrid neutrino mass generation, wherein scotogenic dark sector particles, including dark matter, are charged non-trivially under the $A_4$ flavor symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of the $A_4$ group to residual $\mathcal{Z}_2$ subgroup results in the ``cutting" of the radiative loop. As a consequence the neutrinos acquire mass through the hybrid ``scoto-seesaw" mass mechanism, combining aspects of both the tree-level seesaw and one-loop scotogenic mechanisms, with the residual $\mathcal{Z}_2$ subgroup ensuring the stability of the dark matter. The flavor symmetry also leads to several predictions including the normal ordering of neutrino masses and ``generalized $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry" in leptonic mixing. Additionally, it gives testable predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Finally, $A_4 \to \mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking also leaves its imprint on the dark sector and ties it with the neutrino masses and mixing. The model allows only scalar dark matter, whose mass has a theoretical upper limit of $\lesssim$ 600 GeV, with viable parameter space satisfying all dark matter constraints, available only up to about 80 GeV. Conversely, fermionic dark matter is excluded due to constraints from the neutrino sector. Various aspects of this highly predictive framework can be tested in both current and upcoming neutrino and dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Inhomogenuous instabilities at large chemical potential in a rainbow-ladder QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we continue our efforts to study the existence of a phase with an inhomogeneous, i.e., spatially varying, chiral condensate in QCD. To this end we employ a previously established method of stability analysis of the two-particle irreducible effective action in a truncation that corresponds to a rainbow-ladder approximation of the quark-gluon interaction of QCD. If the analysis is restricted to homogeneous phases, the phase diagram features a first-order chiral transition in the lower-temperature regime. Performing the stability analysis along the lower-chemical-potential border of the corresponding spinodal region, we find that below a certain temperature the homogeneous chirally symmetric solution is unstable against inhomogeneous condensation. We argue that this instability may persist to chemical potentials above the homogeneous first-order phase boundary, in which case it signals the existence of an inhomogeneous ground state. Our methodology is also applicable for more sophisticated truncations of the QCD effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle-II experiment has recently measured $\mathcal{B}(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$, which appears to be almost $3\sigma$ larger than its Standard Model (SM) prediction. In this talk, I will critically revisit the status of the SM predictions for the $B\to K^{(\ast)}\nu\bar{\nu}$ decays, and discuss the interpretation of the recent Belle-II measurement in terms of a general Effective Field Theory, as well as concrete models of physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>CP asymmetry from the effect of the isospin symmetry breaking during B-meson decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct CP asymmetry in quasi-two-body decays of $B \rightarrow (V\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-})P $ is investigated in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) method, where P represents a pseudoscalar meson and V refers to $\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons. We present the amplitude of the quasi-two-body decay process and investigate the effects of mixed resonance involving $\rho^{0}-\omega$, $\rho^{0}-\phi$ and $\omega-\phi$, while considering the impact of isospin symmetry breaking. We observe a significant CP asymmetry when the invariant mass of the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pair is within the resonance ranges of $\rho$, $\omega$ and $\phi$. Consequently, we proceed to quantify the regional CP asymmetry in these resonance regions. A significant difference is observed when comparing results obtained with and without interference and isospin conservation. The CP asymmetry results obtained from the three-body decay process, without interference due to isospin conservation by the PQCD method, are in agreement with the newly updated data acquired by the LHCb experiment.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Gluon TMDs in $J/\psi$ and Pion production at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the azimuthal asymmetries such as $\cos2{\phi_T}$ and Sivers symmetry for $J/\psi$ and $\pi^\pm$ production in electron-proton scattering, focusing on scenarios where the $J/\psi$ and the pion are produced in an almost back-to-back configuration. The electron is unpolarized, while the proton can be unpolarized or transversely polarized. For the $J/\psi$ formation, we use non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), while $\pi^\pm$ is formed due to parton fragmentation. In this kinematics, we utilize the transverse momentum-dependent factorization framework to calculate the cross sections and asymmetries. We consider both quark and gluon-initiated processes and show that the gluon contribution dominates. We provide numerical estimates of the upper bounds on the azimuthal asymmetries, as well as employ a Gaussian parametrization for the gluon transverse momentum distributions (TMDs), within the kinematical region accessible by the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Form factors of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ within light-cone QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we calculated the form factors of the weak decay process $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$, where the final charm baryon represents an excited state with spin-parity $\frac{1}{2}^-$. Utilizing the light-cone QCD sum rules approach, we incorporated the contributions of the lowest two charm baryon states: the ground state $\Lambda_c$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and the excited state $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ in the hadronic representation of the $\Lambda_b$ to $\Lambda_c(2595)$ transition correlation function. This approach allowes us to extract the form factors of the $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ from $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+$ transition. During the light-cone QCD sum rules procedure, we employed the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon. Furthermore, by combining these form factors with the helicity amplitudes of the bottom baryon transition matrix elements, we calculated the differential decay widths for the processes $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell$. Additionally, within the lifetime of $\Lambda_b^0$, we obtained the absolute branching fractions for the semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$. With the branching fractions of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ calculated in this work, we also determined the parameter $\mathcal{R}(\Lambda_c(2595)^+)$ which tests the lepton flavor universality. This parameter is defined as the ratio of branching fractions $\mathcal{B}r(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau)$ and $\mathcal{B}r(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu)$. Our results provide a valuable theoretical test for these decay channels and offer insights into the LCDAs of bottom baryons, paving the way for further in-depth investigations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of three-body decays $B \to D (V \to ) PP $ under the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motived by the accumulated experimental results on three-body charmed $B$ decays with resonance contributions in Babar, LHCb and Belle (II), we systematically analyze $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (V \to) P_1 P_2 $ decays with $V$ representing a vector resonance ($\rho, K^*, \omega$ or $\phi$) and $P_{1,2}$ as a light pseudoscalar meson (pion or kaon). The intermediate subprocesses $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} V$ are calculated with the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude (FAT) approach and the intermediate resonant states $V$ described by the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution successively decay to $P_1 P_2$ via strong interaction. Taking all lowest resonance states ($\rho, K^*, \omega, \phi$) into account, we calculate the branching fractions of these decay modes as well as the Breit-Wigner-tail effects for $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (\rho ,\omega \to) KK$. Our results agree with the data by Babar, LHCb and Belle (II). Among the predictions that are still not observed, there are some branching ratios of order $10^{-6}-10^{-4}$ which are hopeful to be measured by LHCb and Belle II. Our approach and the perturbative QCD approach (PQCD) adopt the compatible theme to deal with the resonance contributions. What's more, our data for the intermediate two-body charmed $B$-meson decays in FAT approach are more precise. As a result, our results for branching fractions have smaller uncertainties, especially for color-suppressed emission diagram dominated modes.</description>

      <title>Upper limit on axion-photon coupling from Markarian 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a stringent upper limit on axion-photon coupling from the 1038 days gamma-ray observations of the TeV blazar Markarian 421. The long-term VHE gamma-ray spectra are measured by the collaborations Fermi-LAT and HAWC from 2015 June to 2018 July. We show the best-fit SEDs of Markarian 421 under the null and axion hypotheses. Then we set the axion-photon limit in the $\{m_a, \, g_{a\gamma}\}$ plane. The 99% $\rm C.L.$ upper limit set by Markarian 421 is $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4.0\times 10^{-12} \rm \, GeV^{-1}$ for the axion mass $[1.0\times10^{-9} \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 1.0\times10^{-8} \, {\rm eV}]$. It is the most stringent upper limit in this axion mass region.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Consumption and Mass-Energy Conversion Induced by Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the nucleon consumption induced by dark matter as a new scenario to overcome the energy threshold of direct detection. It can be realized with proton ($\chi + p \rightarrow \chi + \ell^+$) or neutron ($\chi + n \rightarrow \chi + \nu$) target. Both effective operators and concrete models are provided to illustrate the idea. Since the initial DM and nucleon velocity is only $10^{-3}$ and $1/4$ of the speed of light, respectively, the cross section and hence event rate are determined by the involved particle masses and not affected by the nucleon Fermi motion. Of the two realizations, the proton consumption has richer phenomena with both charged lepton and the daughter nuclei de-excitation to allow double or even triple coincidence to significantly suppress the background. We also illustrate the projected sensitivities at DM and neutrino experiments such as PandaX-4T, DUNE, JUNO, and Hyper-K.</description>

      <title>The new $Z'$ boson of the Bestest Little Higgs Model as a portal to signatures of Higgs bosons $h_0$ and $H_0$ at the future muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the new $Z'$ boson as a portal for the production of Higgs bosons $h_0$ and $H_0$ predicted by the Bestest Little Higgs Model through the Higgs-strahlung processes $\mu^+\mu^- \to (Z, Z') \to Zh_0, ZH_0$. We focus on the resonance and non-resonance effects of the $Zh_0, ZH_0$ signals. In our analysis, we consider the center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 30$ TeV and integrated luminosities of ${\cal L}=2, 4, 6, 10, 30$ ${\rm ab^{-1}}$ projected for a future muon collider. The possibility of performing precision measurements for the Higgs bosons $h_0$ and $H_0$ is very promising at the future muon collider. Furthermore, our results may be helpful to the High Energy Physics community. Complementarily, we generate and provide the Feynman rules necessary for studying the processes $\mu^+\mu^- \to (Z, Z') \to Zh_0, ZH_0$.</description>

      <title>Majorana mass generation, gravitational waves and cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neutrino Majorana mass generation in the early universe might have left imprints in cosmological observables. It can source the production of a detectable stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves with a spectrum that combines a contribution from a first order phase transition production and from the vibration of global cosmic strings. An intriguing possibility is given by the split seesaw model. In this case, in addition to the traditional high scale seesaw, a low scale neutrino Majorana mass generation can solve a potential primordial deuterium problem and ameliorate the cosmological tensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. At the same time, it can also produce subdominant contribution to the NANOGrav signal of a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs), in addition to the astrophysical dominant contribution from supermassive black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillation with minimal length uncertainty relation via wave packet approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories of Quantum Gravity as well as string theory suggest the existence of a minimal measurable length and the related Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The universality of Quantum Gravity implies that the GUP influences every quantum mechanical process. Neutrino oscillation as a quantum phenomenon exhibits quantumness at macroscopic distances and could provide potentially a suitable room for quantum foundation explorations. In this paper, we perturbatively derive the neutrino oscillation probability based on the GUP and by treating neutrinos as wave packets. We see that the GUP modifications are dependent on the effective position width of the transition amplitude $\sigma_x$ such that with the smaller $\sigma_x$ we can obtain a stronger bound on the minimal length scale in comparison to what is expected from standard model interactions. More explicitly, one can obtain an upper bound about $5\times 10^{25}$ for the deformation parameter, $\beta_0$, with accelerator neutrino experiments such as MINOS, provided that $\sigma_x\sim 10^{-15}\text{m}$ which is reasonable since the energy of these neutrinos is of the order of a few GeV.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov Telescope Arrays for High-Energy Neutrino Detection in Mountain Ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the feasibility of employing Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) technology for the detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino-tau particles. By observing the Cherenkov light produced by charged particles resulting from neutrino-tau interactions within mountainous regions, the research seeks to assess the viability of detecting neutrinos within the PeV to EeV energy range. The present paper details the methodology used to calculate the effective detection area and the interaction probabilities of neutrino-tau within the mountains, as well as the flux of Cherenkov photons generated by tau leptons. Furthermore, the present paper addresses the selection of optimal parameters for the telescopes, including mountain dimensions, telescope height, the distance between telescopes, and the distance from the telescopes to the mountain. Strategic placement of the telescopes and the identification of mountain ranges in Algeria that are most suitable for detecting these elusive particles are also discussed. The findings and recommendations for the optimal distribution of telescopes across the selected mountain range are presented, aiming to enhance the detection capabilities for high-energy neutrino-tau particles.</description>

      <title>Compact dwarfs made of light-quark nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing an equivparticle model with both linear confinement and leading-order perturbative interactions, we obtain systematically the properties of strangelets and nonstrange quark matter ($ud$QM) nuggets at various baryon ($A$) and charge ($Z$) numbers, where the detailed single-quark-energy levels are fixed by solving Dirac equations in mean-field approximation (MFA). We then examine the structures of compact dwarfs made of light strangelets or $ud$QM nuggets forming body-centered cubic lattices in a uniform electron background. Despite the strangelets and $ud$QM nuggets generally become more stable at larger $A$, the compact dwarfs are still stable since the fusion reactions between those objects do not take place in the presence of a Coulomb barrier, which is similar to the cases of light nuclei in normal white dwarfs. If $ud$QM dwarfs or strangelet dwarfs are covered with normal matter, their masses and radii become larger but do not exceed those of ordinary white dwarfs. Finally, we investigate the radial oscillation frequencies of $ud$QM dwarfs and strangelet dwarfs, and find that their frequencies are typically higher than traditional white dwarfs. The stability of compact dwarfs are then analysised by examining radial oscillation frequencies of the fundamental mode, where compact dwarfs covered by normal matter are still stable.</description>

      <title>Extended Scotogenic Model of Neutrino Mass and Proton Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current article presents an extension of the classical scotogenic neutrino mass paradigm, where the three issues in particle physics: dark matter, smallness of neutrino mass, and stability of the proton are interconnected. The scenario encompasses the neutrino mass as well as the proton decay as a consequence of an existence of the dark matter. The study successfully achieves the correlation between the naturally small neutrino masses and naturally long proton lifetime in the present paradigm. Furthermore, all relevant cosmological, collider, and flavor physics constraints are incorporated in the detailed analysis. The scotogenic fermionic dark matter with the mass in the range from $100$ GeV to $10$ TeV successfully satisfies all relevant constraints. The valid range of $2.51\times 10^{-5} &lt; \lambda &lt; 2\times 10^{-3}$ is obtained for the 2HDM $\lambda$ coupling. We give a brief discussion, as well as, outline some of the future prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the (thermo)dynamics of the scalar degrees of freedom in the scalar boson stars through the dark matter density under extreme conditions. The boson stars are studied in terms of a dark scalar sector in such a way this sector couples to the standard model Higgs boson doublet plus gravity.The stability of the BS is investigated at the level of the interaction between the scalars with the scale invariance breaking triggered by the electroweak symmetry breaking plus gravity. Analytic methods have been applied to an effective version of the theory, the scalar "tower" approximation, which should preserve an exact scale invariance. The production of the scalar dark matter and its decay have been discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the feebly interacting dark matter with the Standard Model fields, where the preceding and the latter ones are the constituents of the bosonic cosmological objects, the scalar boson stars (BS). The scalar dark matter (SDM) massive fields can form the macroscopic scalar bound state when minimally coupled to gravity (GR). The star may have approximately a stationary form with an asymptotically flat geometry, and the maximal mass of the BS is larger than the solar mass. We consider an effective description of a more complete model with the (thermo)dynamic potential of the BS at finite temperature. The formation of the BS may also be explained in terms of the electric fluxes of the hidden vector field under the influence of the SDM field as the cosmological dynamical quantity minimally coupled to GR. The SDM fields may fluctuate with the temperature and is established around the equilibrium state at some weak background scale.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics of Model H within the real-time fRG approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical dynamics of Model H with a conserved order parameter coupled to a transverse momentum density which describes the gas-liquid or binary-fluid transitions is investigated within the functional renormalization group approach formulated on the closed time path. According to the dynamic scaling analysis, Model H and QCD critical end point belong to the same dynamic universality class in the critical region. The higher-order correction of the transport coefficient $\bar\lambda$ and shear viscosity $\bar\eta$ arising from mode-couplings are obtained by calculating the two-point correlation functions. The flow equation of a dimensionless coupling constant for nondissipative interactions is derived to look for the fixed-point solution of the system. The scaling relation between the critical exponent of the transport coefficient and that of the shear viscosity is estimated. Finally, the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is obtained as a function of the spatial dimension $d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current ongoing advancements in AI have shed light on the landscape of numerical analysis in science. Inspired by the path of achievement of AI, we have developed a method to construct accurate ground state wave functions of multiquark configurations within a quark model. We successfully tested our method through comparisons with meson-type two-body systems with analytic and numerical solutions. We then applied our method to find the ground-state solutions of $T_{cc}$($ud\bar{c}\bar{c}$) and $T_{bb}$($ud\bar{b}\bar{b}$) states. Our findings indicate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving greater accuracy in reproducing highly intricate configurations. Within the model parameters, we find that the $T_{cc}$ is a compact multiquark configuration.</description>

      <title>Impact of Vector like quarks on $(g-2)_{\mu}$ with X-II-2HDM scenario and its phenomenological implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the muon $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly continues to challenge the explanations provided by the Standard Model. However, this anomaly can potentially find reconciliation within the framework of two-Higgs doublet models, provided that the pseudoscalar mass remains low. The introduction of additional fermionic components, such as a generation of vector-like quarks, not only broadens the acceptable parameter range for elucidating the anomaly but also presents an opportunity to circumvent conflicts with constraints from B-decays and heavy Higgs searches. We demonstrate the efficacy of fitting the anomaly in the muon magnetic moment within these models, assuming that vector-like quarks do not undergo mixing with Standard Model quarks. With interactions following a type-X pattern for standard model quarks and a type-II pattern for vector-like quarks, results in models designated as type-XII2HDMVLQ. Additionally, we have explored double Higgs production within this model and observed when both the heavy Higgs and VLQ contribute the double Higgs production cross section significantly enhanced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is exploited to compute vector and axial-vector pion matrix elements in a uniform magnetic field. Our results are model independent, and thereby constitute low-energy theorems that must be obeyed by QCD in external magnetic fields. Chiral perturbation theory and lattice QCD results are compared, for which there is some tension. As an application, the matrix elements are utilized to compute pion decay rates in a magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the SM-like Higgs boson decays $h\rightarrow MZ$ in the Triplet extended NMSSM (TNMSSM),where M is a vector meson ($\rho$, $\omega$, $\phi$, $J/\Psi$, $\Upsilon$). Compared to the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the TNMSSM includes two new SU(2) triplets with hypercharge $\pm 1$ and a SM gauge singlet which are coupled to each other. The indirect contributions to the decays $h \rightarrow MZ$ are produced from the effective $h\gamma Z$ vertex, and they are more important than the direct contributions. The results of this work would encourage a detection on $h \rightarrow Z\gamma$ at the future high energy colliders for exploring new physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>The light quarkonium and charmonium mass shifts in an unquenched quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unquenched quark model for the light quarkonium and the charmonium states is explored in the present work. The quark-pair creation operator in the $^3P_0$ model, which mix the two-quark and four-quark components is modified by considering the effects of the created quark pair's energy, as well as the separation between the created quark pair and the valence quark pair. All the wave functions needed including the mesons and the relative motion between two mesons are all obtained by solving the corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the help of the Gaussian expansion method. Our aim of the present work is to find a new set of parameters which can give a good description of the mass spectrum of the low-lying light quarkonium and charmonium states. Moreover, some exotic states, for example $X(3872)$ can be described well in the unquenched quark model.</description>

      <title>Understanding the nature of the $\Delta(1600)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coupled-channel analysis of the $ J^P = 3/2^+ \Delta $-baryon spectrum, based in the framework of Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory (HEFT). We construct a Hamiltonian which mixes quark model-like single-particle states and two-particle meson-baryon channels, and constrain this via experimentally measured $ \pi N \to \pi N $ scattering observables. In the same vein as L\"{u}scher's approach, we then connect this infinite-volume inspired Hamiltonian with finite-volume lattice QCD results. Drawing on lattice correlation-matrix eigenvectors identifying the $ 1s $ and $ 2s $ states in the finite-volume $ \Delta(3/2^+) $ spectrum, and utilising the HEFT eigenvectors describing the composition of the energy eigenstates, we resolve the structure of these states and their relation to the $ \Delta(1600) $ resonance. We find the dominant contributions to this resonance come from strong rescattering in the $ \pi N $ and $ \pi \Delta $ channels. This contrasts the long-held view of a dominant quark model-like core for the $ \Delta(1600) $. Further discussion of other contemporary lattice results for the $ \Delta $ spectrum and $ \pi N $ scattering states is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss neutrino sector in models with two Higgs doublet and one singlet scalar fields under local $U(1)_{L_\alpha- L_\beta}$ symmetry. A neutrino mass matrix is formulated for these models where the matrix is generated via type-I seesaw mechanism introducing right-handed neutrinos. The neutrino mass matrix has more degrees of freedom compared to minimal scenarios which have only one new scalar field, but its structure is still restricted by the symmetry. Then it is find that sum of neutrino mass can be lower than minimal scenarios and it is easier to satisfy observed constraints. In addition, we can fit neutrino data for $U(1)_{L_e - L_{\mu(\tau)}}$ cases which are disfavored in minimal models. Furthermore, some correlations among sum of neutrino mass and CP violating phases are still found although we have more free parameters.</description>

      <title>Mapping the sources of CP violation in neutrino oscillations from the seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete calculation of the Jarlskog invariant, a working measure of the strength of CP violation in the flavor oscillations of three light neutrino species, with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the flavor structure in the canonical seesaw mechanism. We find that this invariant depends on 240 linear combinations of the 6 original phase parameters that are responsible for CP violation in the decays of three heavy Majorana neutrinos in 27 linear combinations as a whole, and thus provides the first model-independent connection between the microscopic and macroscopic matter-antimatter asymmetries.</description>

      <title>The Covariant Approach for the Radiative Decay of the J/{\Psi} Meson and Relation to Amplitudes Extracted in the Helicity Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed the covariant approach for the partial wave analysis of the radiative decay of the vector meson into two pseudoscalar mesons based on the orbital momentum- intrinsic spin decomposition. This allowed us to include the data on the radiative J/{\Psi} decay into a large data base for analysis of the meson production reactions. The correspondence between partial wave amplitudes extracted in our approach and those extracted in the helicity basis is determined.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure functions of the spin-1 deuteron will be investigated experimentally from the late 2020's at various facilities such as Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, nuclotron-based ion collider facility, and electron-ion colliders. We expect that a new high-energy spin-physics field could be created by these projects. In this paper, the current theoretical status is explained for the structure functions of spin-1 hadrons, especially on parton distribution functions, transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, and fragmentation functions. Related multiparton distribution functions are also shown.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of $N(1535)$ and $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ in the Cabibbo-favored process $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \bar{K}^0\eta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental measurements, we have investigated the Cabibbo-favored process $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \bar{K}^0\eta$, where the $N(1535)$ resonance is dynamically generated from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions within the chiral unitary approach. The contributions from the intermediate $N(1650)$ and the predicted low-lying baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ are also considered. In addition, a Breit-Wigner amplitude for the $N(1535)$ resonance is checked. By comparing with the measured $\eta p$, $\bar{K}^0 \eta$, and $p \bar{K}^0$ invariant mass squared distributions, our results support the interpretation of $N(1535)$ as a dynamically generated state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, with the contribution from $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ taken into account, the calculated invariant mass spectrum agrees with the Belle measurements. Future precise measurements of the $\Lambda_c^+\to p \bar{K}^0\eta$ process can further elucidate the existence of the low-lying baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$.</description>

      <title>Probing flavored regimes of leptogenesis with gravitational waves from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings radiate detectable gravitational waves in models featuring high-scale symmetry breaking, e.g., high-scale leptogenesis. In this Letter, for the first time, we show that different flavored regimes of high-scale leptogenesis can be tested distinctly with the spectral features in cosmic string-radiated gravitational waves. This is possible if the scalar field that makes right-handed neutrinos massive is feebly coupled to the Standard Model Higgs. Each flavored regime, sensitive to low-energy neutrino experiments, leaves a marked imprint on the gravitational waves spectrum. A three-flavor and a two-flavor regime could be probed by a characteristic fall-off of the gravitational wave spectrum at the LISA-DECIGO-ET frequency bands with preceding scale-invariant amplitudes bounded from above and below. We present Gravitational Waves windows for Flavored Regimes of Leptogenesis (GWFRL) falsifiable in the upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous CP violation in Supersymmetric QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a composite model of spontaneous CP violation based on a new supersymmetric QCD as a solution to the strong CP problem. The scalar components of the meson chiral superfields obtain complex vacuum expectation values to break CP symmetry spontaneously. Then, wavefunction renormalization for the quark kinetic terms provides the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase, while the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta}$ is protected by nonrenormalization of the superpotential and hermiticity of the wavefunction renormalization factor. In our model, the right-handed down-type quark multiplets are given by composite states, enhancing their couplings to CP breaking fields, which is essential to realize the observed CKM phase. The non-perturbative dynamics generates the scale of spontaneous CP violation hierarchically lower than the Planck scale. We discuss potential corrections to $\bar{\theta}$ and find a viable parameter space of the model to solve the strong CP problem without fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) effective field theory, we study the leptoproduction of $J/{\psi}$ at next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD for both unpolarized and polarized electron-ion collisions. We demonstrate that the $J/{\psi}$-tagged deep inelastic scattering in the future Electron-Ion Collider can be served as a golden channel for the reasons including constraining NRQCD long distance matrix elements, probing the nuclear gluon distribution functions, as well as investigating the gluon helicity distribution inside a longitudinal polarized proton.</description>

      <title>Relic neutrino decay: a solution to the excess radio background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of excess radio background detected by ARCADE 2 suggests the presence of new physics as there exists no clear astrophysical solution. We find that the radiative decay of a relic neutrino into a sterile neutrino, assumed to be quasi-degenerate, provides a very good fit to ARCADE 2 data. The solution also predicts a stronger 21 cm absorption global signal than the predicted one from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a contrast brightness temperature. The solution obtained is in mild tension with a much stronger signal claimed by the EDGES collaboration.</description>

      <title>The hydrodynamics of inverse phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First order phase transitions are violent phenomena that occur when the state of the universe evolves abruptly from one vacuum to another. A \emph{direct} phase transition connects a local vacuum to a deeper vacuum of the zero--temperature potential, and the energy difference between the two minima manifests itself in the acceleration of the bubble wall. In this sense, the transition is triggered by the release of vacuum energy. On the other hand, an \emph{inverse} phase transition connects a deeper minimum of the zero--temperature potential to a higher one, and the bubble actually expands against the vacuum energy. The transition is then triggered purely by thermal corrections. We study for the first time the hydrodynamics and the energy budget of inverse phase transitions. We find several modes of expansion for inverse bubbles, which are related to the known ones for direct transitions by a mirror symmetry. We finally investigate the friction exerted on the bubble wall and comment on the possibility of runaway walls in inverse phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Methodology for Analyzing Proton Multiplicity Fluctuations with Azimuthal Partitions in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A primary objective in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is to investigate the phase transition between confined and deconfined color matter. Complementary to the cumulants of conserved charges integrated over the full azimuth, we introduce a novel experimental approach to explore particle fluctuations in azimuthal partitions, which are potentially sensitive to the first-order phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. We evaluate proton multiplicity ($N_w$) fluctuations in azimuthal partitions of width $w$ to quantitatively estimate the clustering tendency among these protons. The $\Delta \sigma^2$ observable is defined as the normalized difference between the variance of the $N_w$ distribution and the binomial baseline. We demonstrate the feasibility and characteristics of this observable through simulations using the AMPT and MUSIC+FIST models. We also use a Gaussian correlation model to illustrate that the dependence of $\Delta \sigma^2$ on $w$ can be parameterized to accurately extract the strength and the range of the input interaction among protons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient technique for calculating the angular two-point correlation functions (or ''overlap reduction functions'') induced by gravitational waves in both the pulse arrival times of pulsars and in the angular deflections of distant sources. In the most general case, there are six auto- and cross-correlations for the pulse arrival times and the two components of the angular deflection. We provide results for spin-2 (i.e., general-relativistic) gravitational waves as well as the spin-1 modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories. These calculations can be easily implemented for future analysis or study, and we provide code to do so.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Mapping and Factorising Cosmological Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction that characterises the state of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a simple yet novel duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion. The duality manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry in the correspondence between correlators and the physical parts of wavefunction coefficients. To demonstrate the power of the duality already at tree-level, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations are in principle testable as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics (i.e. without performing any analytic continuation or taking any soft limits). For $n=4$, the CCF formula provides a relation between the parity-odd part of the trispectrum of curvature perturbations, the bispectra involving two curvature perturbations and an additional state with a complementary series mass and integer spin, and the power spectrum of this additional state.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Generation without Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>Reassessing constant-roll Warm Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Departing from standard slow-roll conditions is one way of putting the inflationary paradigm to test, and constraining the dynamics of the inflaton field with a constant-rate of roll of the inflaton field, a.k.a. the constant-roll scenario, is one way of exploring such deviation from the standard slow-roll dynamics. In this manuscript we explore such a possibility in a variant inflationary scenario, known as Warm Inflation. We construct and derive the conditions for having constant-roll WI models where inflation lasts at least for 60 $e-$folds, gracefully exits the constant-roll inflation phase, and maintains near thermal equilibrium of the system which is an essential feature of WI in the slow-roll regime. We show that while certain models of WI (the ones with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature alone) can accommodate constant-roll dynamics, others (with dissipative coefficient as a function of temperature and the inflaton field both) fail to maintain thermal equilibrium once the constant-roll condition is imposed and hence cannot produce a constant-roll WI phase.</description>

      <title>Muon neutrinos and the cosmological abundance of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the mixed dark matter scenarios consisting of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particle dark matter (DM), PBHs can accrete surrounding DM particles to form ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs or clothed PBHs) even at early epoch of the Universe. The distribution of DM particles in a UCMH follows a steeper density profile compared with classical DM halo. It is expected the DM annihilation rate is very large in UCMHs resulting in a contribution to, e.g., the extragalactic neutrino flux. In this work, we investigate the extragalactic neutrino flux from clothed PBHs due to DM annihilation, and then the muon flux for neutrino detection. Compared with the atmospheric neutrino flux, we derive the upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs for 10 years exposure time of, e.g., the IceCube experiment. For the DM mass $m_{\chi}=100~(1000)$ GeV, the upper limits (2$\sigma$) on the fraction of DM in PBHs are $f_{\rm PBH}=1.2\times 10^{-3}~(8.9\times 10^{-5})$ for contained events and $f_{\rm PBH}=2.5\times 10^{-3}~(1.3\times 10^{-5})$ for upward events, respectively. Compared with other constrains, although the upper limits obtained by us are not the strongest, it is a different way to study the cosmological abundance of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Green's functions in the presence of a bubble wall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field theoretical tools are developed so that one can analyze quantum phenomena such as transition radiation that must have occurred during the Higgs condensate bubble expansion through plasma in the early universe. Integral representations of Bosonic and Fermionic propagators are presented for the case that particle masses are varied continuously during the passage through the bubble wall interface between symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken regions. The construction of propagators is based on the so-called eigenfunction expansion method associated with self-adjoint differential operators, developed by Weyl, Stone, Titchmarsh, Kodaira and several others. A novel method of field quantization in the presence of the bubble wall is proposed by using the spectral functions introduced in constructing the two-point Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Quark orbital angular momentum in the proton from a twist-3 generalized parton distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark orbital angular momentum in the proton is evaluated via a Lattice QCD calculation of the second Mellin moment of the twist-3 generalized parton distribution $\widetilde{E}_{2T} $ in the forward limit. The connection between this approach to quark orbital angular momentum and approaches previously utilized in Lattice QCD calculations, via generalized transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions and via Ji's sum rule, is reviewed. This connection can be given in terms of Lorentz invariance and equation of motion relations. The calculation of the second Mellin moment of $\widetilde{E}_{2T} $ proceeds via a finite-momentum proton matrix element of a quark bilocal operator with a straight-line gauge connection and separation in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. The dependence on the former component serves to extract the second Mellin moment, whereas the dependence on the latter component provides a transverse momentum cutoff for the matrix element. Furthermore, a derivative of the matrix element with respect to momentum transfer in the forward limit is required, which is obtained using a direct derivative method. The calculation utilizes a clover fermion ensemble at pion mass 317 MeV. The resulting quark orbital angular momentum is consistent with previous evaluations through alternative approaches, albeit with greater statistical uncertainty using a comparable number of samples.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent progress in developing high-precision relativistic chiral nucleon-nucleon interactions, we study the antinucleon-nucleon interaction at the leading order in the covariant chiral effective field theory. The phase shifts and inelasticities with $J\leq 1$ are obtained and compared to their non-relativistic counterparts. For most partial waves, the descriptions of phase shifts and inelasticities in the leading-order covariant chiral effective field theory are comparable to those in the next-to-leading order non-relativistic chiral effective field theory, confirming the relatively faster convergence observed in the nucleon-nucleon sector. In addition, we search for bound states/resonances near the $\bar{N}N$ threshold and find several structures that can be associated with those states recently observed by the BESIII Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Axion-Photon Coupling Using Stellar Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asteroseismology has been shown to be, together with stellar modelling, an invaluable tool in constraining properties of novel physics. In this work, we study for the first time the influence of axionic production in the evolution of a late main-sequence star, comparing computational models with observational data in order to constrain the axion-photon $g_{a\gamma}$ coupling parameter. We first perform a high-precision calibration of a stellar model to our target star, in order to obtain a benchmark for our other diagnostics. We then apply a two-stage test, first using global quantities and then resorting to precision seismic ratios. We find that seismology allows us to place an independent upper bound of $g_{a\gamma} \leq 0.98\times 10^{-10} $ GeV$^{-1}$ at a $68\%$ confidence level (CL), in the same order of magnitude as both the most recent constraints from the observation of globular clusters and previous bounds obtained through stellar modelling, but more stringent than most current direct axion detections. We also suggest a more conservative limit of $g_{a\gamma} \leq 1.38\times 10^{-10} $ GeV$^{-1}$ at a $95\%$ CL. Moreover, this new diagnostic method can be applied to stellar data that will be obtained in future asteroseismic projects.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Model Proposal for Quantum Gravity and the Quantum Mechanics of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a large $N$ quantum mechanics of non-abelian bosonic and fermionic variables as a model for quantum gravity. The theory admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in the matrix model. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on the product of the black holes masses and the Newton constant exactly as in Newton gravity. To extract the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, a resummation of all the large $N$ corrections is needed. We outline how Newton gravity may be reproduced in the long distance limit. We also show that the interaction energy is generally finite in the short distance limit, suggesting that the black hole singularity in general relativity is removed in our quantum description of black hole.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unfolding of detector effects in experimental data is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel unfolding approach using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. We test our approach by training a single cDDPM to perform multidimensional particle-wise unfolding for a variety of physics processes, including those not seen during training. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion Creation by Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background at 1-loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl fermions of spin $\frac12$ minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity in 4 dimensions cannot be produced purely gravitationally in an expanding Universe at tree level. Surprisingly, as we showed in a recent letter [1], this changes at gravitational 1-loop when cosmic perturbations, like a gravitational wave background, are present. Such a background introduces a new scale, thereby breaking the fermions' conformal invariance. This leads to a non-vanishing gravitational self-energy for Weyl fermions at 1-loop and induces their production. In this paper, we present an extended study of this new mechanism, explicitly computing this effect using the in-in formalism. We work in an expanding Universe in the radiation-dominated era as a fixed background. Gravitational wave-induced fermion production has rich phenomenological consequences. Notably, if Weyl fermions eventually acquire mass, and assuming realistic - and potentially detectable - gravitational wave backgrounds, the mechanism can explain the abundance of dark matter in the Universe. More generally, gravitational-wave induced freeze-in is a new purely gravitational mechanism for generating other feebly interacting fermions, e.g. right-handed neutrinos. We show that this loop level effect can dominate over the conventional - tree-level - gravitational production of superheavy fermions in a sizable part of the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the complete one-loop electroweak corrections to the inclusive $H\rightarrow ZZ$ and $H\rightarrow Z\gamma$ decays in the dimension-$6$ extension of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The corrections to $H\rightarrow ZZ$ are computed for on-shell $Z$ bosons and are a precursor to the physical $H\rightarrow Z f {\overline{f}}$ calculation. We present compact numerical formulas for our results and demonstrate that the logarithmic contributions that result from the renormalization group evolution of the SMEFT coefficients are larger than the finite NLO contributions to the decay widths. As a by-product of our calculation, we obtain the first complete result for the finite corrections to $G_\mu$ in the SMEFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate analytically and numerically that "optimized partial dressing" (OPD) thermal mass resummation, which uses gap equation solutions inserted into the tadpole, efficiently tames finite-temperature perturbation theory calculations of the effective thermal potential, without necessitating use of the high-temperature approximation. An analytical estimate of the scale dependence for OPD resummation, standard Parwani resummation (Daisy resummation), and dimensional reduction shows that OPD has similar scale dependence to dimensional reduction, greatly improving Parwani resummation. We also elucidate how to construct and solve the gap equation for realistic numerical calculations, and demonstrate OPD's improved accuracy for a toy scalar model. OPD's improved accuracy is most physically significant when the high-temperature approximation breaks down, rendering dimensional reduction unusable and Parwani resummation highly inaccurate, with the latter underestimating the maximal gravitational wave amplitude for the model by 2 orders of magnitude compared to OPD. Our work highlights the need to bring theoretical uncertainties under control even when analyzing broad features of a model. Given the simplicity of the OPD compared to two-loop dimensional reduction, as well as the ease with which this scheme handles departures from the high-temperature expansion, we argue this scheme has great potential in analyzing the parameter space of realistic beyond the Standard Model models.</description>

Abstract: A variety of supergravity and string models involve hidden sectors where the hidden sectors may couple feebly with the visible sectors via a variety of portals. While the coupling of the hidden sector to the visible sector is feeble its coupling to the inflaton is largely unknown. It could couple feebly or with the same strength as the visible sector which would result in either a cold or a hot hidden sector at the end of reheating. These two possibilities could lead to significantly different outcomes for observables. We investigate the thermal evolution of the two sectors in a cosmologically consistent hidden sector dark matter model where the hidden sector and the visible sector are thermally coupled. Within this framework we analyze several phenomena to illustrate their dependence on the initial conditions. These include the allowed parameter space of models, dark matter relic density, proton-dark matter cross section, effective massless neutrino species at BBN time, self-interacting dark matter cross-section, where self-interaction occurs via exchange of dark photon, and Sommerfeld enhancement. Finally fits to the velocity dependence of dark matter cross sections from galaxy scales to the scale of galaxy clusters is given. The analysis indicates significant effects of the initial conditions on the observables listed above. The analysis is carried out within the framework where dark matter is constituted of dark fermions and the mediation between the visible and the hidden sector occurs via the exchange of dark photons. The techniques discussed here may have applications for a wider class of hidden sector models using different mediations between the visible and the hidden sectors to explore the impact of Big Bang initial conditions on observable physics.</description>

      <title>Identifying physics beyond SMEFT in the angular distribution of $\Lambda_b\rightarrow \Lambda_c(\rightarrow\Lambda\pi)\tau\bar\nu_\tau$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry of the Standard Model is linearly realized. However, it is possible that more general effective field theories, such as the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) where this symmetry is realized non-linearly, are needed to describe the data. Identifying physics beyond SMEFT could shed light on the nature of Higgs and the realization of the electroweak symmetry. We explore the possibility of such an identification by studying the effects of scalar and vector new-physics operators on the angular distribution of $\Lambda_b\rightarrow \Lambda_c(\rightarrow\Lambda\pi)\tau\bar\nu_\tau$. This decay is sensitive to the 6-dimensional effective operator $O_V^{LR}\equiv(\bar{\tau}\gamma^\mu P_L\nu_\tau)(\bar{c}\gamma_\mu P_R b)$, which is present in HEFT but suppressed in SMEFT. We identify the angular observables that can have significant contributions from $O_V^{LR}$, and hence would be useful for probing not only BSM physics but also physics beyond SMEFT. We further find that constraining the branching ratio of $B_c\rightarrow \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ would be crucial for performing this task.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Lepton Masses and Mixing with Discrete Flavor Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing is an outstanding puzzle in particle physics, generally known as the flavor problem. Over the years, guided by precision neutrino oscillation data, discrete flavor symmetries have often been used to explain the neutrino mixing parameters, which look very different from the quark sector. In this review, we discuss the application of non-Abelian finite groups to the theory of neutrino masses and mixing in the light of current and future neutrino oscillation data. We start with an overview of the neutrino mixing parameters, comparing different global fit results and limits on normal and inverted neutrino mass ordering schemes. Then, we discuss a general framework for implementing discrete family symmetries to explain neutrino masses and mixing. We discuss CP violation effects, giving an update of CP predictions for trimaximal models with nonzero reactor mixing angle and models with partial $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry, and constraining models with neutrino mass sum rules. The connection between texture zeroes and discrete symmetries is also discussed. We summarize viable higher-order groups, which can explain the observed pattern of lepton mixing where the non-zero $\theta_{13}$ plays an important role. We also review the prospects of embedding finite discrete symmetries in the Grand Unified Theories and with extended Higgs fields. Models based on modular symmetry are also briefly discussed. A major part of the review is dedicated to the phenomenology of flavor symmetries and possible signatures in the current and future experiments at the intensity, energy, and cosmic frontiers. In this context, we discuss flavor symmetry implications for neutrinoless double beta decay, collider signals, leptogenesis, dark matter, as well as gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: We first assemble a full set of the Boltzmann Equation in Diffusion Approximation (BEDA) for studying thermalization/hydrodynamization as well as the production of massless quarks and antiquarks in out of equilibrium systems. In the BEDA, the time evolution of a generic system is characterized by the following space-time dependent quantities: the jet quenching parameter, the effective temperature, and two more for each quark flavor that describe the conversion between gluons and quarks/antiquarks via the $2\leftrightarrow2$ processes. Out of the latter two quantities, an effective net quark chemical potential is defined, which equals the net quark chemical potential after thermal equilibration. We then study thermalization and the production of three flavors of massless quarks and antiquarks in spatially homogeneous systems initially filled only with gluons. A parametric understanding of thermalization and quark production is obtained for either initially very dense or dilute systems, which are complemented by detailed numerical simulations for intermediate values of initial gluon occupancy $f_0$. For a wide range of $f_0$, the final equilibration time is determined to be about one order of magnitude longer than that in the corresponding pure gluon systems. Moreover, during the final stage of the thermalization process for $f_0\geq 10^{-4}$, gluons are found to thermalize earlier than quarks and antiquarks, undergoing the top-down thermalization.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Vacuum Polarization Contribution to $\boldsymbol{g_{\mu}-2}$ as a function of the external lepton mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of a lepton is considered as a function of the lepton mass. We show how the analyticity properties of this function allow for its full reconstruction when it is only known in a restricted mass region. Assuming that LQCD could evaluate it in an optimal mass region we show, within the framework of a phenomenological model, how to reconstruct the function elsewhere, in particular at the muon mass value.</description>

      <title>Majorana neutrinos in Double Inverse Seesaw and $\boldsymbol{\Delta(54)}$ Flavor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study entails the augmentation of the $\Delta$(54) flavor symmetry model by including the ISS mechanism by two Standard Model Higgs particles, achieved by the inclusion of different flavons. The matrices are discussed numerically in the framework of the $\Delta(54)$ flavor model with the ISS mechanism for Majorana neutrinos. We introduced Vector like (VL) fermions and a Weyl fermion, which are gauge singlets in the Standard Model. We restrict the undesirable terms in our Lagrangian using additional symmetry. Due to the addition of additional flavons, the precise tribimaximal neutrino mixing pattern deviates, resulting in the creation of a non-zero reactor angle $\theta_{13}$. We found that the atmospheric oscillation parameter ($\theta_{23}$) occupies the upper octant under the normal hierarchy situation. We also study the CP violation ($\delta_{CP}$) , Jarlskog invariant parameter ($J$), and Neutrinoless double-beta decay parameter ($m_{ee}$) in the parameter space of the normal hierarchy model to see whether they accord with the most recent neutrino observations.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the signatures of new physics scenarios featuring third-family quark-lepton unification at the TeV scale in lepton-quark fusion at hadron colliders. Working with complete UV dynamics based on the $SU(4)$ gauge symmetry in the third-family fermions, we simulate the resonant production of a vector leptoquark at the next-to-leading order, including its decay and matching to the parton showers. The precise theoretical control over this production channel allows us to set robust bounds on the vector leptoquark parameter space which are complementary to the other production channels at colliders. We emphasize the importance of the resonant channel in future searches and discuss the impact of variations in the model space depending on the flavor structure of the vector leptoquark couplings.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave as a Probe of Light Feebly Interacting Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light feebly interacting dark matter is widely predicted in a plethora of new physics models. However, due to very feeble couplings with the Standard Model particles, its relic density produced via the relativistic thermal freeze-out process easily exceeds the observed value. The entropy dilution in an early matter-dominated era provides an attractive mechanism for solving such an overabundance problem. In this work, we note that this dark matter dilution mechanism will lead to two distinctive kinks in the primordial GW spectrum, whose frequencies strongly correlate with the DM mass. We show that the GW detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Big Bang Observer (BBO), can measure the kinks in the primordial GW spectrum and will offer a new avenue to probe light feebly interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>A cosmological "Big Storm Scenario" following the QCD phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was proposed that acoustic perturbations generated by the QCD phase transition could create an inverse turbulent cascade \cite{Kalaydzhyan:2014wca}. An assumption was that propagation toward smaller momenta could reach the wavelength of a few km, the Universe's size at the time. Such acoustic waves were proposed to be the source of gravity waves. The kilometer wavelength corresponds to year-long gravity wave today, which were recently discovered using pulsar correlations. This paper argues further that an acoustic turbulence must be an ensemble of shocks. This brings two consequences: First, shocks generate gravity waves much more efficiently than sound waves due to the intermittency of matter distribution. We reconsider gravity wave radiation, using universal emission theory for soft radiation, and argue that soft-momenta plateau should reach wavelengths of the order of shock mean free paths. Second, collisions of shock waves create local density excess, which may create primordial black holes. A good tool to settle this issue can be an evaluation of the {\em trapped surfaces} like it was done in studies of heavy ion collisions using AdS/CFT correspondence</description>

      <title>Chiral condensate and the equation of state at nonzero baryon density from the hadron resonance gas model with a repulsive mean field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the QCD equation of state and the chiral condensate using the hadron resonance gas model with repulsive mean-field interactions. We find that the repulsive interactions improve the agreement with the lattice results on the derivatives of the pressure with respect to the baryon chemical potential up to eighth order. From the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate we estimate the crossover temperature as a function of baryon chemical potential, $T_{pc}(\mu_B)$. We find that the chiral crossover line starts to deviate significantly from the chemical freeze-out line already for $\mu_B&gt;400$ MeV. Furthermore, we find that the chiral pseudocritical line can be parametrized as $T_{pc}(\mu_B)/T_{pc}(0)=1-\kappa_2 (\mu_B/T_{pc} (0))^2-\kappa_4 (\mu_B/T_{pc} (0))^4$ with $\kappa_2=0.0150(2)$ and $\kappa_4=3.1(6) \times 10^{-5}$, which are in agreement with lattice QCD results for small values of $\mu_B$. For the first time we find a tiny but non-zero value of $\kappa_4$ in our study.</description>

Abstract: A variety of possibilities exist for dark matter aside from WIMPS, such as hidden sector dark matter. We discuss synchronous thermal evolution of visible and hidden sectors and show that the density of thermal relics can change $O(100\%)$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ by a factor of up to $10^5$ depending of whether the hidden sector was hot or cold at the reheat temperature. It is also shown that the approximation of using separate entropy conservation for the visible and hidden sectors is invalid even for a very feeble coupling between the two.</description>

      <title>Automated resummation of electroweak Sudakov logarithms in diboson production at future colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At energies that are large with respect to the electroweak scale, the electroweak corrections to scattering processes involve large logarithms that have to be resummed to obtain decent predictions. Soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) has been proposed as a suitable framework to allow for this resummation, while retaining non-logarithmic corrections in a consistent way. In this paper, we investigate the approximations needed to use this approach for the calculation of electroweak corrections to off-shell diboson production at high-energy colliders. Upon implementing the method into a Monte-Carlo integration code, we provide resummed predictions for cross sections and distributions at a 3 TeV lepton collider and a 100 TeV proton collider.</description>

      <title>Search for R-Parity-Violation-Induced Charged Lepton Flavor Violation at Future Lepton Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interest in searches for Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) has continued in the past few decades since the observation of CLFV will indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). As several future lepton colliders with high luminosity have been proposed, the search for CLFV will reach an unprecedented level of precision. Many BSM models allow CLFV processes at the tree level, such as the R-parity-violating (RPV) Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), which is a good choice for benchmark. In this paper, we perform a detailed fast Monte Carlo simulation study on RPV-induced CLFV processes at future lepton colliders, including a 240 GeV circular electron positron collider (CEPC) and a 6 or 14 TeV muon collider. As a result, we found that the upper limits on the $\tau$ related RPV couplings will be significantly improved, while several new limits on RPV couplings can be set, which are inaccessible by low-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Lightcone and quasi distribution amplitudes for light octet and decuplet baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of leading-twist lightcone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) and quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) for light octet and decuplet baryons within large momentum effective theory. In LaMET, LCDAs can be factorized in terms of a hard kernel and quasi-DAs that are defined as spatial correlators and calculable on Lattice QCD. To renormalize quasi-DAs and eliminate the singular terms $\ln(\mu^2 z_i^2)'s$ in them, which undermine the efficacy in perturbative expansion, we adopt a hybrid renormalization scheme that combines the self-renormalization and ratio scheme. Through self-renormalization, we eliminate UV divergences and linear divergences at large spatial separations in quasi distribution amplitudes without introducing additional nonperturbative effects. By taking a ratio with respect to the zero-momentum matrix element, we effectively remove UV divergences at small spatial separations. Under the hybrid renormalization scheme, we calculate the hard kernels up to one-loop accuracy. It turns out that only four different hard kernels are needed for all leading-twist LCDAs of octet and decuplet baryons. These results are crucial for the lattice-based exploration of the LCDAs of a light baryon from the first principle of QCD.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, the strong decays of the newly observed $P_{cs}(4338)$ as well as its high isospin cousin $P_{cs}(4460)$ are studied via the QCD sum rules. According to conservation of isospin, spin and parity, the hadronic coupling constants in four decay channels are obtained, then the partial decay widths are obtained. The total width of the $P_{cs}(4338)$ coincides with the experimental data nicely, while the predictions for the $P_{cs}(4460)$ can be testified in the future experiment, and shed light on the nature of the $P_{cs}(4338)$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decay of $\Omega_b\to\Omega_c~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in three lepton channels. To this end, we use QCD sum rule method in three point framework to calculate the form factors defining the matrix elements of these transitions. Having calculated the form factors as building blocks, we calculate the decay widths and branching fractions of the exclusive decays in all lepton channels and compare the results with other theoretical predictions. The obtained results for branching ratios and ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels may help experimental groups in their search for these weak decays. Comparison of the obtained results with possible future experimental data can be useful to check the order of consistency between the standard model theory predictions and data on the heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14480v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Sp(2$N_c$) gauge dynamics with two Dirac fermion flavours in the fundamental representation. These strongly coupled systems underlie some composite Higgs models with a global symmetry breaking pattern SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4), leading to a light quartet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons that can play the role of the Higgs. Including four-fermion interactions can rotate the vacuum to a technicolour breaking pattern. Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the underlying gauge dynamics. Our model incorporates the $N_c$-specific running of the fermion anomalous dimension and can thus distinguish between specific gauge groups. We determine the bound-state spectrum of the UV SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4) symmetry breaking model, also including fermion masses and mass splitting, and display the $N_c$ dependence. The inclusion of a four-fermion interaction shows the emergence of three Goldstone bosons on the path to technicolour dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Attention-based transformer models have become increasingly prevalent in collider analysis, offering enhanced performance for tasks such as jet tagging. However, they are computationally intensive and require substantial data for training. In this paper, we introduce a new jet classification network using an MLP mixer, where two subsequent MLP operations serve to transform particle and feature tokens over the jet constituents. The transformed particles are combined with subjet information using multi-head cross-attention so that the network is invariant under the permutation of the jet constituents.
  We utilize two clustering algorithms to identify subjets: the standard sequential recombination algorithms with fixed radius parameters and a new IRC-safe, density-based algorithm of dynamic radii based on HDBSCAN. The proposed network demonstrates comparable classification performance to state-of-the-art models while boosting computational efficiency drastically. Finally, we evaluate the network performance using various interpretable methods, including centred kernel alignment and attention maps, to highlight network efficacy in collider analysis tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extended Left-Right symmetric model with an additional global symmetry $U(1)_X$, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking collapses to a residual subgroup $\mathbb{Z}_2$, ensuring that the light active neutrino masses are generated via a double seesaw mechanism at two loop level, with the Dirac submatrix arising at one loop. It also guarantees one loop level masses for the SM charged fermions lighter than the top quark and protects Dark Matter (DM) candidates of the model. To the best of our knowledge our model has the first implementation of the radiative double seesaw mechanism with the Dirac submatrix generated at one loop level. We show that the model can successfully accommodate the observed pattern of SM fermion masses as well as mixings and is compatible with the constraints arising from the muon $g-2$ anomaly, neutrinoless double beta decay and DM.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Cosmological Total Energy Density and Transient Periods in Cosmology</title>

Abstract: The evolution of the Universe is traditionally examined by monitoring how its material content evolves as it expands. This model of an isolated system is expressed as the equation of motion of the bulk but segmented into different epochs. In particular, the evolution of the {\it $Friedmann-Lema\hat{i}tre-Robertson - Walker$} (FRLW) Universe is separated into different epochs that are characterised by the dynamics of whichever mass-energy density constituent is dominant at the time. The standard analysis of the evolution of the Universe in a particular epoch often considers the evolution of the dominant energy density only, disregarding all others. Whereas this represents the limiting case, in principle the contributions from others cannot always be ignored particularly in the vicinity of the equality of the various competing mass-energy densities or the transition periods between epochs. We examine the evolution of the total energy density rather than individual energy densities during the different epochs. We find that taking into account the contributions from the various constituents lead to a broader range of possible evolution histories which enriches the standard picture.</description>

      <title>$\Delta I = 3/2$ and $\Delta I = 1/2$ channels of $K\to\pi\pi$ decay at the physical point with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice calculation of the $K\to\pi\pi$ matrix elements and amplitudes with both the $\Delta I = 3/2$ and 1/2 channels and $\varepsilon'$, the measure of direct $CP$ violation. We use periodic boundary conditions (PBC), where the correct kinematics of $K\to\pi\pi$ can be achieved via an excited two-pion final state. To overcome the difficulty associated with the extraction of excited states, our previous work \cite{Bai:2015nea,RBC:2020kdj} successfully employed G-parity boundary conditions, where pions are forced to have non-zero momentum enabling the $I=0$ two-pion ground state to express the on-shell kinematics of the $K\to\pi\pi$ decay. Here instead we overcome the problem using the variational method which allows us to resolve the two-pion spectrum and matrix elements up to the relevant energy where the decay amplitude is on-shell.
  In this paper we report an exploratory calculation of $K\to\pi\pi$ decay amplitudes and $\varepsilon'$ using PBC on a coarser lattice size of $24^3\times64$ with inverse lattice spacing $a^{-1}=1.023$ GeV and the physical pion and kaon masses. The results are promising enough to motivate us to continue our measurements on finer lattice ensembles in order to improve the precision in the near future.</description>

      <title>Did we hear the sound of the Universe boiling? Analysis using the full fluid velocity profiles and NANOGrav 15-year data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyse sound waves arising from a cosmic phase transition where the full velocity profile is taken into account as an explanation for the gravitational wave spectrum observed by multiple pulsar timing array groups. Unlike the broken power law used in the literature, in this scenario the power law after the peak depends on the macroscopic properties of the phase transition, allowing for a better fit with pulsar timing array (PTA) data. We compare the best fit with that obtained using the usual broken power law and, unsurprisingly, find a better fit with the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum that utilizes the full velocity profile. We then discuss models that can produce the best-fit point and complementary probes using CMB experiments and searches for light particles in DUNE, IceCUBE-Gen2, neutrinoless double beta decay, and forward physics facilities at the LHC like FASER nu, etc.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Ultralight Dark Matter from NANOGrav</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The compelling evidence for the detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background by NANOGrav imposes constraints on the mass of compact cores of ultralight dark matter, also known as "solitons", surrounding supermassive black holes found at the centers of large galaxies. The strong dynamical friction between the rotating black holes and the solitons competes with gravitational emission, resulting in a suppression of the characteristic strain in the nHz frequency range. Our findings robustly rule out ultralight dark matter particles with masses ranging from $1.3\times 10^{-21}$ eV to $1.4\times 10^{-20}$ eV condensing into solitons around supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Holography of Broken U(1) Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the Abelian Higgs model in (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with an ultraviolet brane. The gauge symmetry is broken by a bulk Higgs vacuum expectation value triggered on the brane. We propose two separate Goldstone boson equivalence theorems for the boundary and bulk degrees of freedom. We compute the holographic self-energy of the gauge field and show that its spectrum is either a continuum, gapped continuum, or a discretuum as a function of the Higgs bulk mass. When the Higgs has no bulk mass, the AdS isometries are unbroken. We find in that case that the dual CFT has a non-conserved U(1) current whose anomalous dimension is proportional to the square of the Higgs vacuum expectation value. When the Higgs background weakly breaks the AdS isometries, we present an adapted WKB method to solve the gauge field equations. We show that the U(1) current dimension runs logarithmically with the energy scale in accordance with a nearly-marginal U(1)-breaking deformation of the CFT.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering of Dark Matter with Heavy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of inelastic collisions between dark matter (DM) and heavy cosmic ray (CR) nuclei on CR propagation. We approximate the fragmentation cross-sections for DM-CR collisions using collider-measured proton-nuclei scattering cross-sections, allowing us to assess how these collisions affect the spectra of CR Boron and Carbon. We derive new CR spectra from DM-CR collisions by incorporating their cross-sections into the source terms and solving the diffusion equation for the complete network of reactions involved in generating secondary species. In a specific example with a coupling strength of $b_{\chi}=0.1$ and a DM mass of $m_{\chi}=0.1$ GeV, considering a simplified scenario where DM interacts exclusively with Oxygen, a notable modification in the Boron-to-Carbon spectrum due to the DM-CR interaction is observed. Particularly, the peak within the spectrum, spanning from $0.1$ GeV to $10$ GeV, experiences an enhancement of approximately 1.5 times. However, in a more realistic scenario where DM particles interact with all CRs, this peak can be amplified to twice its original value.Utilizing the latest data from AMS-02 and DAMPE on the Boron-to-Carbon ratio, we estimate a 95\% upper limit for the effective inelastic cross-section of DM-proton as a function of DM mass. Our findings reveal that at $m_\chi\simeq 2$ MeV, the effective inelastic cross-section between DM and protons must be less than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})~{\rm cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-scalar meson spectral properties in the chiral crossover region of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the type of excitations that can exist in a thermal medium is key to understanding how hadronic matter behaves at extreme temperatures. In this work we study this question for pseudo-scalar mesons comprised of light-strange and strange-strange quarks, analysing how their low-energy spectral properties are modified as one passes through the high-temperature chiral crossover region between $T=145.6 \, \text{MeV}$ and $172.3 \, \text{MeV}$. We utilise the non-perturbative constraints satisfied by correlation functions at finite temperature in order to extract the low-energy meson spectral function contributions from spatial correlator lattice data in $N_{f}=2+1$ flavour QCD. The robustness of these contributions are tested by comparing their predictions with data for the corresponding temporal correlator at different momentum values. We find that around the pseudo-critical temperature $T_{\text{pc}}$ the data in both the light-strange and strange-strange channels is consistent with the presence of a distinct stable particle-like ground state component, a so-called thermoparticle excitation. As the temperature increases this excitation undergoes collisional broadening, and this is qualitatively the same in both channels. These findings suggest that pseudo-scalar mesons in QCD have a bound-state-like structure at low energies within the chiral crossover region which is still strongly influenced by the vacuum states of the theory.</description>

      <title>Can Primordial Black Holes form in the Standard Model ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the Standard Model (SM) in a scenario that does not rely on specific inflationary features or any exotic physics such as phase transitions or non-minimal coupling to gravity. If the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) field lies exactly at the transition between metastability and stability, its potential exhibits an inflexion point due to radiative corrections. The BEH can act like a stochastic curvaton field, leading to a non-Gaussian tail of large curvature fluctuations that later collapse into PBHs when they re-enter inside the horizon. This scenario would require a precise value of the top-quark mas to ensure the Higgs stability, which is disfavored but still consistent with the most recent measurements. However, we also find that large curvature fluctuations are also generated on cosmological scales that are inconsistent with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We therefore conclude that the SM cannot have led to the formation of PBHs based on this mechanism. Nevertheless, a variation of the scenario based on the Palatini formulation of gravity may have provided the conditions to produce stellar-mass PBHs with an abundance comparable to dark matter, without producing too large curvature fluctuations on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Anti-de Sitter $\to$ de Sitter transition driven by Casimir forces and mitigating tensions in cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last few years, low- and high-redshift observations set off tensions in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate $H_0$ and in the determination of the amplitude of the matter clustering in the late Universe (parameterized by $S_8$). It was recently noted that both these tensions can be resolved if the cosmological constant parametrizing the dark energy content switches its sign at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. However, the anti-de Sitter (AdS) swampland conjecture suggests that the postulated switch in sign of the cosmological constant at zero temperature seems unlikely because the AdS vacua are an infinite distance appart from de Sitter (dS) vacua in moduli space. We provide an explanation for the required AdS $\to$ dS crossover transition in the vacuum energy using the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk. We then use entropy arguments to claim that any AdS $\to$ dS transition between metastable vacua must be accompanied by a reduction of the species scale where gravity becomes strong. We provide a few examples supporting this AdS $\to$ dS uplift conjecture.</description>

      <title>Gamma-rays and Neutrinos from Giant Molecular Cloud Populations in the Galactic Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent IceCube detection of significant neutrino flux from the inner Galactic plane has provided us valuable insights on the spectrum of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. This flux can be produced either by a population of Galactic point sources or by diffused emission from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium or by a mixture of both. In this work, we compute diffused gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes produced by a population of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our Galaxy, assuming different parametrizations of the Galactic diffused cosmic ray distribution. In particular, we take into account two main cases: (I) constant cosmic ray luminosity in our Galaxy, and (II) space-dependent cosmic ray luminosity, based on the supernovae distribution in our Galaxy. For Case-I, we found that the neutrino flux from GMCs is a factor of $\sim 10$ below compared to $\pi^0$ and KRA$_\gamma$ best-fitted models of IceCube observations at $10^5$ GeV. Instead, for Case-II the model can explain up to $\sim 90 \%$ of the neutrino flux at that energy. Moreover, for this last scenario IceCube detector could be able to detect neutrino events from the Galactic centre regions. We then calculated gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from individual GMCs and noticed that several current and future Cherenkov telescopes and neutrino observatories have the right sensitivities to study these objects. In particular, very neutrino-bright region such as Aquila Rift is favourable for detection by the IceCube-Gen2 observatory.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the relativistic field-theoretic three-particle finite-volume scattering formalism to describe generic $DD\pi$ systems in the charm $C=2$ sector. This includes the isospin-0 channel, in which the recently discovered doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ is expected to manifest as a pole in the $DD \pi \to DD \pi$ scattering amplitude. The formalism presented here can also be applied to lattice QCD settings in which the $D^*$ is bound and, in particular, remains valid below the left-hand cut in $D D^*$ scattering, thus resolving an issue in previous analyses of lattice-determined finite-volume energies.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter solves the final parsec problem of supermassive black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, plausibly originating from the merger of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), is accumulating with observations from pulsar timing arrays. An outstanding question is how inspiraling SMBHs get past the "final parsec" of separation, where they have a tendency to stall before GW emission alone can make the binary coalesce. We argue that dynamical friction from the dark matter (DM) spike surrounding the black holes is sufficient to resolve this puzzle, if the DM has a self-interaction cross section of order $\,$cm$^2$/g. The same effect leads to a softening of the GW spectrum at low frequencies as suggested by the current data. For collisionless cold DM, the friction deposits so much energy that the spike is disrupted and cannot bridge the final parsec, while for self-interacting DM, the isothermal core of the halo can act as a reservoir for the energy liberated from the SMBH orbits. A realistic velocity dependence, such as generated by the exchange of a massive mediator like a dark photon, is favored to give a good fit to the GW spectrum while providing a large enough core. A similar velocity dependence has been advocated for solving the small-scale structure problems of cold DM.</description>

      <title>An \'Etude on the Regularization and Renormalization of Divergences in Primordial Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many cosmological observables of interest derive from primordial vacuum fluctuations evolved to late times. These observables represent statistical draws from some underlying quantum or statistical field theoretic framework where infinities arise and require regularization. After subtracting divergences, renormalization conditions must be imposed by measurements or observations at some scale, mindful of scheme and background dependence. We review this process on backgrounds that transition from finite duration inflation to radiation domination, and show how in spite of the ubiquity of scaleless integrals, UV divergences can still be meaningfully extracted from quantities that nominally vanish when dimensionally regularized. In this way, one can contextualize calculations with hard cutoffs, distinguishing between UV and IR scales corresponding to the beginning and end of inflation from UV and IR scales corresponding the unknown completion of the theory and its observables. This distinction has significance as observable quantities cannot depend on the latter although they will certainly depend on the former. One can also explicitly show the scheme independence of the coefficients of UV divergent logarithms. Furthermore, certain IR divergences can be shown to be an artifact of the de Sitter limit and are cured for finite duration inflation. For gravitational wave observables, we stress the need to regularize stress tensors that do not presume a prior scale separation in their construction (as with the standard Isaacson form), deriving an improved stress tensor fit to purpose. We conclude by highlighting the inextricable connection between inferring $N_{\rm eff}$ bounds from vacuum tensor perturbations and the process of background renormalization.</description>

      <title>Development of generic no-scale inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop generalized no-scale supergravity models of inflation, and then study the corresponding cosmological predictions as well as the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). With a new parameter $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, the $\alpha$-generalized no-scale supergravity provides the continuous connections among the generic no-scale supergravity from string theory compactifications. The resulting prediction of the CMB, spectrum index $n_s$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ can be highly consistent with the latest Planck/BICEP/Keck Array observations. Notably, the models with $\alpha\neq 1$ give a smaller ratio $r\leq 10^{-3}$, which is flexible even under the anticipated tighter observational constraints at the future experiments. Additionally, these models have the potential to generate a broad-band stochastic gravitational wave background, and thus explain the NANOGrav 15yr signal. Furthermore, they predict the formation of PBHs with various mass scales, which could account for a significant portion of dark matter relic density in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Condensate-Induced Inflation from Primordial Gravitational Waves in String-Inspired Chern-Simons Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a cosmological model of inflation that characterises Chern-Simons (CS) gravity models inspired from string theory. Such models are known to belong to the class of the so-called String-Inspired Running Vacuum Cosmologies. In particular, by applying methods of dynamical systems, commonly used in scalar-field cosmology, we examine in detail, for the first time, the passage from a pre-inflationary era dominated by a stiff-axion-matter equation of state, characteristic of the model, to inflation of Running Vacuum Model (RVM) type. By a careful discussion of the formation of the condensate of the CS gravitational anomaly term, induced by populations of primordial gravitational waves at the end of the stiff-axion-matter era, we show that an effectively linear axion-monodromy potential arises. This eventually causes the transition from the matter to the RVM inflation. By taking into account terms that have previously been ignored in the relevant literature of weak-graviton quantisation, we show that the effect of such terms is to diminish the value of the condensate by half, remaining however in the same order of magnitude. This, in turn, implies that the qualitative conclusions of previous works on the subject remain valid. Moreover, on assuming the approximate cosmic-time independence of the gravitational-CS condensate, we also provide an estimate of the number of sources of the primordial gravitational waves, upon the requirement of respecting the transplanckian conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rotating metrics and new multipole moments from scattering amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the vacuum metric generated by a generic rotating object in arbitrary dimensions up to third post-Minkowskian order by computing the classical contribution of scattering amplitudes describing the graviton emission by massive spin-1 particles up to two loops. The solution depends on the mass, angular momenta, and on up to two parameters related to generic quadrupole moments. In $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, we recover the vacuum Hartle-Thorne solution describing a generic spinning object to second order in the angular momentum, of which the Kerr metric is a particular case obtained for a specific mass quadrupole moment dictated by the uniqueness theorem. At the level of the effective action, the case of minimal couplings corresponds to the Kerr black hole, while any other mass quadrupole moment requires non-minimal couplings. In $D&gt;4$, the absence of black-hole uniqueness theorems implies that there are multiple spinning black hole solutions with different topology. Using scattering amplitudes, we find a generic solution depending on the mass, angular momenta, the mass quadrupole moment, and a new stress quadrupole moment which does not exist in $D=4$. As special cases, we recover the Myers-Perry and the single-angular-momentum black ring solutions, to third and first post-Minkowksian order, respectively. Interestingly, at variance with the four dimensional case, none of these solutions corresponds to the minimal coupling in the effective action. This shows that, from the point of view of scattering amplitudes, black holes are the "simplest" General Relativity vacuum solutions only in $D=4$.</description>

      <title>Double Inflation in Classically Conformal $B-L$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown in Ref. [1] that the double-inflation scenario based on the Coleman-Weinberg potential can successfully generate primordial black holes (PBHs) with the inflationary predictions consistent with the Planck measurements. These PBHs can play the role of dark matter in our universe. In this paper, we propose the classically conformal minimal $B-L$ model as an ultra-violet (UV) completion of the scenario. In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis. Based on the scalar power spectrum shown in Ref. [1], we evaluate the scalar induced gravitational wave spectrum, which can be tested by various proposed gravitational wave observatories like BBO, DECIGO etc.</description>

      <title>Convolutional L2LFlows: Generating Accurate Showers in Highly Granular Calorimeters Using Convolutional Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the quest to build generative surrogate models as computationally efficient alternatives to rule-based simulations, the quality of the generated samples remains a crucial frontier. So far, normalizing flows have been among the models with the best fidelity. However, as the latent space in such models is required to have the same dimensionality as the data space, scaling up normalizing flows to high dimensional datasets is not straightforward. The prior L2LFlows approach successfully used a series of separate normalizing flows and sequence of conditioning steps to circumvent this problem. In this work, we extend L2LFlows to simulate showers with a 9-times larger profile in the lateral direction. To achieve this, we introduce convolutional layers and U-Net-type connections, move from masked autoregressive flows to coupling layers, and demonstrate the successful modelling of showers in the ILD Electromagnetic Calorimeter as well as Dataset 3 from the public CaloChallenge dataset.</description>
