      <title>Dynamical modes of highly elastic loops settling under gravity in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The settling of highly elastic non-Brownian closed fibres (called loops) under gravity in a viscous fluid is investigated numerically. The loops are represented using a bead-spring model with harmonic bending potential and finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) stretching potential. Numerical solutions to the Stokes equations are obtained with the use of HYDROMULTIPOLE numerical codes, which are based on the multipole method corrected for lubrication to calculate hydrodynamic interactions between spherical particles with high precision. Depending on the elasto-gravitation number B, a ratio of gravitation to bending forces, the loop approaches different attracting dynamical modes, as described by Gruziel-Slomka et al. (Soft Matter, vol. 15, 2019, pp. 7262-7274) with the use of the Rotne-Prager mobility of the elastic loop made of beads. Here, using a more precise method, we find and characterise a new mode, analyse typical timescales, velocities, and orientations of all the modes, compare them, and investigate their coexistence. We analyse the transitions (bifurcations) to a different mode at certain critical values of the elasto-gravitation number B.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Simulation Model for Crystalline Polymer Solids by using Breakable Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a highly coarse-grained simulation model for crystalline polymer solids with crystalline lamellar structures. The mechanical properties of a crystalline polymer solid are mainly determined by the crystalline lamellar structures. This means that coarse-grained models rather than fine-scale molecular models are suitable to study mechanical properties. We model a crystalline polymer solid by using highly coarse-grained particles, of which size is comparable to the crystalline layer thickness. One coarse-grained particle consists of multiple subchains, and is much larger than monomers. Coarse-grained particles are connected by bonds to form a network structure. Particles are connected by soft but ductile bonds, to form a rubber-like network. Particles in the crystalline region are connected by hard but brittle bonds. Brittle bonds are broken when large deformations are applied. We perform uniaxial elongation simulations based on our coarse-grained model. As the applied strain increases, crystalline layers are broken into pieces and non-affine and collective motions of broken pieces are observed. Our model can successfully reproduce yield behaviors which are similar to typical crystalline polymer solids.</description>

      <title>Effects of Photopatterning Conditions on Azimuthal Surface Anchoring Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially-varying alignment of liquid crystals is essential for research and applications. One widely used method is based on the photopatterning of thin layers of azo-dye molecules, such as Brilliant Yellow (BY), that serve as an aligning substrate for a liquid crystal. In this study, we examine how photopatterning conditions, such as BY layer thickness (b), light intensity (I), irradiation dose, and age affect the alignment quality and the strength of the azimuthal surface anchoring. The azimuthal surface anchoring coefficient, W, is determined by analyzing the splitting of integer disclinations into half-integer disclinations at prepatterned substrates. The strongest anchoring is achieved for b in the range of 5 - 8 nm. W increases with the dose, and within the same dose, W increases with I. Aging of a non-irradiated BY coating above 15 days reduces W. Sealed photopatterned cells filled with a conventional nematic preserve their alignment quality for up to four weeks, after which time W decreases. This work suggests the optimization pathways for photoalignment of nematic liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>How do imperfections cause asymmetry in elastic snap-through?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetrically-buckled arch whose boundaries are clamped at an angle has two stable equilibria: an inverted and a natural state. When the distance between the clamps is increased (i.e. the confinement is decreased) the system snaps from the inverted to the natural state. Depending on the rate at which the confinement is decreased ('unloading'), the symmetry of the system during snap-through may change: slow unloading results in snap-through occurring asymmetrically, while fast unloading results in a symmetric snap-through. It has recently been shown [Wang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 267201 (2024)] that the transient asymmetry at slow unloading rates is the result of the amplification of small asymmetric precursor oscillations (shape perturbations) introduced dynamically to the system, even when the system itself is perfectly symmetric. In reality, however, imperfections, such as small asymmetries in the boundary conditions, are present too. Using numerical simulations and a simple toy model, we discuss the relative importance of intrinsic imperfections and initial asymmetric shape perturbations in determining the transient asymmetry observed. We show that, for small initial perturbations, the magnitude of the asymmetry grows in proportion to the size of the intrinsic imperfection but that, when initial shape perturbations are large, intrinsic imperfections are unimportant - the asymmetry of the system is dominated by the transient amplification of the initial asymmetric shape perturbations. We also show that the dominant origin of asymmetry changes the way that asymmetry grows dynamically. Our results may guide engineering and design of snapping beams used to control insect-sized jumping robots.</description>

      <title>Systematic Fluorination is a Powerful Design Strategy Towards Fluid Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals combine liquid-like fluidity and orientational order of conventional nematics with macroscopic electric polarization comparable in magnitude to solid state ferroelectric materials. Here, we present a systematic study of twenty-seven homologous materials with various fluorination patterns, giving new insight into the molecular origins of spontaneous polar ordering in fluid ferroelectric nematics. Beyond our initial expectations, we find the highest stability of the NF phase to be in materials with specific fluorination patterns rather than the maximal fluorination which might be expected based on simple models. We find a delicate balance between polar and apolar nematics which is entirely dictated by the substitution of the fluorine atoms. Aided by electronic structure calculations, we show this to have its origins in the radial distribution of charge across the molecular surface, with molecules possessing a more oscillatory distribution of electrons across their surfaces possessing a higher propensity to form polar nematic phases. This work provides a new set of ground rules and designing principles which can inform the synthesis of future ferroelectric nematogens.</description>

      <title>Hindered stokesian settling of discs and rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the mean settling velocities for suspensions of discs and rods in the stokes regime for a number of particle aspect ratios. All these shapes display "hindered settling", namely, a decrease in settling speed as the solid volume fraction is increased. A comparison of our data to spheres reveals that discs and rods show less hindering than spheres at the same relative interparticle distance. The data for all six of our particle shapes may be scaled to collapse on that of spheres, with a scaling factor that depends only on the volume of the particle relative to a sphere. Despite the orientational degrees of freedom available with nonspherical particles, it thus appears that the dominant contribution to the hindered settling emerges from terms that are simply proportional to the volume of the sedimenting particles.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of topological defects in glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies point out far-reaching connections between the topological characteristics of structural glasses and their material properties, paralleling results in quantum physics that highlight the relevance of the nature of the wavefunction. However, the structural arrangement of the topological defects in glasses has so far remained elusive. Here we investigate numerically the geometry and statistical properties of the topological defects related to the vibrational eigenmodes of a prototypical three-dimensional glass. We find that at low-frequencies these defects form scale-invariant, quasi-linear structures and dictate the plastic events morphology when the system is subjected to a quasi-static shear, i.e., the eigenmode geometry shapes plastic behavior in 3D glasses. Our results indicate the existence of a deep link between the topology of eigenmodes and plastic energy dissipation in disordered materials, thus generalizing the known connection identified in crystalline materials. This link is expected to have consequences also for the relaxation dynamics in the liquid state, thus opening the door for a novel approach to describe this dynamics.</description>

      <title>Simulating squirmers with smoothed particle dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microswimmers play an important role in shaping the world around us. The squirmer is a simple model for microswimmer whose cilia oscillations on its spherical surface induce an effective slip velocity to propel itself. The rapid development of computational fluid dynamics methods has markedly enhanced our capacity to study the behavior of squirmers in aqueous environments. Nevertheless, a unified methodology that can fully address the complexity of fluid-solid coupling at multiple scales and interface tracking for multiphase flows remains elusive, posing an outstanding challenge to the field. To this end, we investigate the potential of the smoothed particle dynamics (SPD) method as an alternative approach for simulating squirmers. The Lagrangian nature of the method allows it to effectively address the aforementioned difficulty. By introducing a novel treatment of the boundary condition and assigning appropriate slip velocities to the boundary particles, the SPD-squirmer model is able to accurately represent a range of microswimmer types including pushers, neutral swimmers, and pullers. We systematically validate the steady-state velocity of the squirmer, the resulting flow field, its hydrodynamic interactions with the surrounding environment, and the mutual collision of two squirmers. In the presence of Brownian motion, the model is also able to correctly calculate the velocity and angular velocity autocorrelation functions at the mesoscale. Finally, we simulate a squirmer within a multiphase flow by considering a droplet that encloses a squirmer and imposing a surface tension between the two flow phases. We find that the squirmer within the droplet exhibits different motion types.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Nanoparticles in Liquid Crystals: The Role of Ionic Transport at Small Concentrations of the Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal the visible influence of the ultra-small concentrations (1 wt.% or less) of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles (average size 24 nm) on the current-voltage characteristics and capacitance of the dielectric liquid crystal (LC) 5CB. The pure LC cell demonstrates higher current (and thus smaller resistance) than the LC cells filled with a very small concentration (0.5-1) wt.% of BTO nanoparticles. The same trend is observed for the charge-voltage characteristics: the capacitance loop is the widest for the pure LC cell and becomes noticeably thinner in the presence of (0.5-1) wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. This seems counterintuitive, because 1 wt.% of ferroelectric nanoparticles very slightly modify the effective dielectric response and should not influence on the director distribution and elastic properties of the LC. We conclude that a possible physical reason of this observation is the influence of the ionic-electronic screening charges, which cover the ferroelectric nanoparticles and become polarized in the external field, on the ionic transport in the LC.</description>

      <title>Dense Random Packing of Disks With a Power-Law Size Distribution in Thermodynamic Limit: Fractal-like Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation properties of a random system of densely packed disks, obeying a power-law size distribution, are analyzed in reciprocal space in the thermodynamic limit. This limit assumes that the total number of disks increases infinitely, while the mean density of the disk centers and the range of the size distribution are kept constant. We investigate the structure factor dependence on momentum transfer across various number of disks and extrapolate these findings to the thermodynamic limit. The fractal power-law decay of the structure factor is recovered in reciprocal space within the fractal range, which corresponds to the range of the size distribution in real space. The fractal exponent coincides with the exponent of the power-law size distribution as was shown previously by the authors [A. Yu. Cherny, E. M. Anitas, V. A. Osipov, J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044114 (2023)]. The dependence of the structure factor on density is examined. As is found, the power-law exponent remains unchanged but the fractal range shrinks when the packing fraction decreases. Additionally, the finite-size effects are studied at extremely low momenta of the order of the inverse system size. We show that the structure factor is parabolic in this region and calculate the prefactor analytically. The obtained results reveal fractal-like properties of the packing and can be used to analyze small-angle scattering from such systems.</description>

      <title>Ductile and brittle yielding of athermal amorphous solids: a mean-field paradigm beyond the random field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing a unified theory describing both ductile and brittle yielding constitutes a fundamental challenge of non-equilibrium statistical physics. Recently, it has been proposed that the nature of the yielding transition is controlled by physics akin to that of the quasistatically driven Random field Ising model (RFIM), which has served as the paradigm for understanding the effect of quenched disorder in slowly driven systems with short-ranged interactions. However, this theoretical picture neglects both the dynamics of, and the elasticity-induced long-ranged interactions between, the mesoscopic material constituents. Here, we address these two aspects and provide a unified theory building on the H\'ebraud-Lequeux elastoplastic description. The first aspect is crucial to understanding the competition between the imposed deformation rate and the finite timescale of plastic rearrangements: we provide a dynamical description of the macroscopic stress drop and predictions for the divergence of the peak susceptibility with inverse shear rate. The second is essential in order to capture properly the behaviour in the limit of quasistatic driving, where avalanches of plasticity diverge with system size at any value of the strain. We fully characterise the avalanche behaviour, which is radically different to that of the RFIM. In the quasistatic, infinite size limit, we find that both models have mean-field Landau exponents, obscuring the effect of the interactions. We show, however, that the latter profoundly affect the behaviour of finite systems approaching the spinodal-like brittle yield point, where we recover qualitatively the finite-size trends found in particle simulations, and modify the nature of the random critical point separating ductile and brittle yielding, where we predict critical behaviour on top of the marginality present at any value of the strain.</description>

      <title>Scattered waves fuel emergent activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter taps into external energy sources to power its own processes. Systems of passive particles ordinarily lack this capacity, but can become active if the constituent particles interact with each other nonreciprocally. By reformulating the theory of classical wave-matter interactions, we demonstrate that interactions mediated by scattered waves generally are not constrained by Newton's third law. The resulting center-of-mass forces propel clusters of scatterers, enabling them to extract energy from the wave and rendering them active. This form of activity is an emergent property of the scatterers' state of organization and can arise in any system where mobile objects scatter waves. Emergent activity flips the script on conventional active matter whose nonreciprocity emerges from its activity, and not the other way around. We combine theory, experiment and simulation to illustrate how emergent activity arises in wave-matter composite systems and to explore the phenomenology of emergent activity in experimentally accessible models. These preliminary studies suggest that heterogeneity is a singular perturbation to the dynamics of wave-matter composite systems, and induces emergent activity under all but the most limited circumstances.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear conductivity of aqueous electrolytes: beyond the first Wien effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conductivity of strong electrolytes increases under high electric fields, a nonlinear response known as the first Wien effect. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations we show that this increase is almost suppressed in moderately concentrated aqueous electrolytes due to the alignment of the water molecules by the electric field. As a consequence of this alignement, the permittivity of water decreases and becomes anisotropic, an effect which can be measured in simulations and reproduced by a model of water molecules as dipoles. We incorporate the resulting anisotropic interactions between the ions into a Stochastic Density Field Theory and calculate ionic correlations as well as corrections to the Nernst-Einstein conductivity, which are in qualitative agreement with the numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.</description>

Abstract: We use supervised machine learning together with the concepts of classical density functional theory to investigate the effects of interparticle attraction on the pair structure, thermodynamics, bulk liquid-gas coexistence, and associated interfacial phenomena in many-body systems. Local learning of the one-body direct correlation functional is based on Monte Carlo simulations of inhomogeneous systems with randomized thermodynamic conditions, randomized planar shapes of the external potential, and randomized box sizes. Focusing on the prototypical Lennard-Jones system, we test predictions of the resulting neural attractive density functional across a broad spectrum of physical behavior associated with liquid-gas phase coexistence in bulk and at interfaces. We analyse the bulk radial distribution function $g(r)$ obtained from automatic differentiation and the Ornstein-Zernike route and determine i) the Fisher-Widom line, i.e. the crossover of the asymptotic (large distance) decay of $g(r)$ from monotonic to oscillatory, ii) the (Widom) line of maximal correlation length, iii) the line of maximal isothermal compressibility and iv) the spinodal by calculating the poles of the structure factor in the complex plane. The bulk binodal and the density profile of the free liquid-gas interface are obtained from density functional minimization and the corresponding surface tension from functional line integration. We also show that the neural functional describes accurately the phenomena of drying at a hard wall and of capillary evaporation for a liquid confined in a slit pore. Our neural framework yields results that improve significantly upon standard mean-field treatments of interparticle attraction. Comparison with independent simulation results demonstrates a consistent picture of phase separation even when restricting the training to supercritical states only.</description>

      <title>Transport of molecules via polymerization in chemical gradients</title>

Abstract: The transport of molecules for chemical reactions is critically important in various cellular biological processes. Despite thermal diffusion being prevalent in many biochemical processes, it is unreliable for any sort of directed transport or preferential accumulation of molecules. In this paper we propose a strategy for directed motion in which the molecules are transported by active carriers via polymerization. This transport is facilitated by chemical/activity gradients which generate an effective drift of the polymers. By marginalizing out the active degrees of freedom of the system, we obtain an effective Fokker-Planck equation for the Rouse modes of such active-passive hybrid polymers. In particular, we solve for the steady state distribution of the center of mass and its mean first passage time to reach an intended destination. We focus on how the arrangement of active units within the polymer affect its steady-state and dynamic behaviour and how they can be optimized to achieve high accumulation or rapid motility.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in two dimensions on ultra-fast time scales</title>

Abstract: Melting of two-dimensional mono-crystals is described within the celebrated Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young scenario (KTHNY-Theory) by the dissociation of topological defects. It describes the shielding of elasticity due to thermally activated topological defects until shear elasticity disappears. As a well defined continuous phase transition, freezing and melting should be reversible and independent of history. However, this is not the case: cooling an isotropic 2D fluid with a finite but nonzero rate does not end in mono-crystals. The symmetry can not be broken globally but only locally in the thermodynamic limit due to the critical slowing down of order parameter fluctuations. This results in finite sized domains with the same order parameter. For linear cooling rates, the domain size is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, originally developed for the defect formation of the primordial Higgs-field shortly after the Big-Bang. In the present manuscript, we investigate the limit of the deepest descent quench on a colloidal monolayer and resolve the time dependence of structure formation for (local) symmetry breaking. Quenching to various target temperatures below the melting point (deep in the crystalline phase and just close to the transition), we find universal behaviour if the timescale is re-scaled properly.</description>
