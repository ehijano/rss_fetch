      <title>Research projects and Moscow Mathematical Conference for high school students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shares some experience in advanced mathematical education. We show how a high school student can be naturally and gradually introduced to basic steps of scientific research: developing intuition by finding and correcting mistakes through discussions and writing a paper, (transparent) anonymous peer review, recognition and award. We show that most of this can be done in research projects not aiming at scientific novelty. We share the experience (both principles and examples) of the Moscow Mathematical Conference of High School Students.</description>

      <title>Amicable numbers and their connection to the Euler totient function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair of numbers is amicable if each number equals the sum of the proper divisors of the other. This paper after exploring the history and evolution of amicable numbers, introduces a novel characterization of amicable pairs whose greatest common divisor is a power of two, using their distinct prime factorizations. Specifically, we examine pairs of the forms $A=2^n ab, B=2^n cd$, $A=2^n abc, B=2^n de$, and $A=2^n abc, B=2^n def$. From these configurations, we establish explicit symmetric identities that relate the sum $\varphi(A)+\varphi(B)$ of Euler's totient functions directly to the odd prime factors of $A$ and $B$.</description>

      <title>Hawksmoor's Ceiling, Mercator's Projection and the Roman Pantheon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ceiling of the Buttery in All Souls College, Oxford, designed by the English Baroque architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, has a vaulted form on an oval base. It is coffered with an array of approximately square sunken lacunaria, whose sizes and positions vary so as to accommodate the constraints of the curved surface and its boundaries. A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder. This guarantees that the coffer ribs meet exactly at right angles and the coffers are close to being square. These mappings are simply the inverse of Mercator's projection of the curved surface onto a plane. For a ceiling which is a general surface of revolution, we derive formulae for the dimensions and location of each coffer. Our results, taking into account camera distortion, are in excellent agreement with photographs of the Hawksmoor ceiling and the Pantheon dome, as well as with recent direct measurements of the latter. We also describe a protocol by which Hawksmoor's ceiling might have been constructed without advanced mathematics.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Legendre Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Legendre transformation in a geometric way based on the procedure of the Legendrian lift. This approach allows us to understand some interesting properties of it, in particular, the reason for the appearance of singularities of dual curves. Also we consider application of the Legendre transformation to the Clairaut differential equation. Finally, we say a few words class of contact transformations and present an infinite group of contact transformations different from the Legendre transformation.
  Keywords: Legendre transformation, duality, contact transformation, contact structure, pedal curve, singular point, Clairaut equation</description>

      <title>$x$ Plays Pokemon, for Almost-Every $x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a brief write-up showing that for any finite state game, a disjunctive number $x$ will eventually win that game. The proof techniques here are well known and this result follows immediately from folklore results in graph theory and cellular automata. This short paper primarily serves as an expositional piece to collect this proof with the fun context of $\pi$ Plays Pok\'emon serving as motivation.</description>

      <title>Galilei and Huygens: Music and science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vincenzo Galilei and Constantijn Huygens were both humanists and eminent musicians, the former from the late Renaissance and the latter from the early Modern era. Their respective sons, Galileo and Christiaan, were scientists whose importance cannot be overestimated. My aim in this chapter is to set the scene for a parallel presentation of the legacy of the Galilei on the one hand, and the Huygens on the other. This will give us an opportunity to talk about mathematics, music and acoustics, but also about science in general, at this time of birth of the Modern era.</description>
