      <title>Unique continuation properties for the continuous Anderson operator in dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider singular continuous Anderson operators $H=\Delta+\xi$ on closed manifolds of dimension 1 and 2, and prove a unique continuation property for its eigenfunctions using the theory of quasi-conformal mappings. We investigate its nodal set by proving that it is quasi-conformal to the nodal set of a Laplace eigenfunction and prove a Courant nodal theorem. We also present an application to control for singular operator in dimension 1.</description>

      <title>Mean Minkowski content and mean fractal curvatures of random self-similar code tree fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of random self-similar fractals based on code trees which includes random recursive, homogeneous and V-variable fractals and many more. For such random fractals we consider mean values of the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures of their parallel sets for small parallel radii. Under the uniform strong open set condition and some further geometric assumptions we show that rescaled limits of these mean values exist as the parallel radius tends to 0. Moreover, integral representations are derived for these limits which recover and extend those known in the deterministic case and certain random cases. Results on the mean Minkowski content are included as a special case and shown to hold under weaker geometric assumptions.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for non-Hermitian Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the modulus of the extreme eigenvalues is investigated for the complex Ginibre and complex induced Ginibre ensembles in the limit of large dimensions of random matrices. The limiting distribution of the scaled spectral radius and the scaled minimum modulus for the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, with a proportional rectangularity index, is the Gumbel distribution. The independence of these extrema is established, at appropriate scaling, for large matrices from the complex Ginibre ensemble as well as from the complex induced Ginbre ensemble for either fixed or proportional rectangularity indexes. The joint distribution of the eigenvalues moduli for the complex Ginibre ensemble is derived in this paper. It is equal to the joint distribution of independent random variables each following a Gamma-Rayleigh distribution. In the limit of a large size of the complex Ginibre matrices, the left and right tail distributions of the minimum modulus are the Rayleigh and Weibull distributions, respectively. The limiting left tail distribution of minimum modulus is the same for these non-Hermitian ensembles when the rectangularity index of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble is equal to zero. This phenomenon is also verified for the right tail distribution of this minimum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives a non-asymptotic analysis of the largest Lyapunov exponent of truncated orthogonal matrix products. We prove that as long as N, the number of terms in product, is sufficiently large, the largest Lyapunov exponent is asympototically Gaussian. Futhermore, the sum of finite Lyapunov exponent is asympototically Gaussian, where we use Weingarten Calculus.</description>

      <title>Randomized Routing to Remote Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study load balancing for a queueing system where parallel stations are distant from customers. In the presence of traveling delays, the join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy induces queue length oscillations and prolongs the mean waiting time. A variant of the JSQ policy, dubbed the randomized join-the-shortest-queue (RJSQ) policy, is devised to mitigate the oscillation phenomenon. By the RJSQ policy, customers are sent to each station with a probability approximately proportional to its service capacity; only a small fraction of customers are purposely routed to the shortest queue. The additional probability of routing a customer to the shortest queue, referred to as the balancing fraction, dictates the policy's performance. When the balancing fraction is within a certain range, load imbalance between the stations is negligible in heavy traffic, so that complete resource pooling is achieved. We specify the optimal order of magnitude for the balancing fraction, by which heuristic formulas are proposed to fine-tune the RJSQ policy. A joint problem of capacity planning and load balancing is considered for geographically separated stations. With well planned service capacities, the RJSQ policy sends all but a small fraction of customers to the nearest stations, rendering the system asymptotically equivalent to an aggregated single-server system with all customers having minimum traveling delays. If each customer's service requirement does not depend on the station, the RJSQ policy is asymptotically optimal for reducing workload.</description>

      <title>Sharp asymptotics for $N$-point correlation functions of coalescing heavy-tailed random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of coalescing continuous-time random walks starting from every site on $\mathbb{Z}$, where the jump increments lie in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable distribution with $\alpha\in(0,1]$. We establish sharp asymptotics for the $N$-point correlation function of the system. Our analysis relies on two precise tail estimates for the system density, as well as the non-collision probability of $N$ independent random walks with arbitrary fixed initial configurations. In addition, we derive refined estimates for heavy-tailed random walks, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arbitrary matrices $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, randomly perturbed in an additive manner using a random matrix $R \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, are shown to asymptotically almost surely satisfy the so-called {\sl robust null space property} whilst asymptotically meeting the optimal number of measurements required for {\sl unique reconstruction} via $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithms. A wide range of random perturbation matrices is considered; in that, $R$ is allowed to be sub-gaussian, sub-exponential, as well as extremely heavy-tailed, where only the first $\log n$ moments of each entry of $R$ are bounded. A key tool driving our proofs is {\sl Mendelson's small-ball method} ({\em Learning without concentration}, J. ACM, Vol. $62$, $2015$).</description>

      <title>Tail distributions of cover times of once-reinforced random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the tail distribution of the edge cover time of a specific non-Markov process, $\delta$ once-reinforced random walk, on finite connected graphs, whose transition probability is proportional to weights of edges. Here the weights are $1$ on edges not traversed and $\delta\in(0,\infty)$ otherwise. In detail, we show that its tail distribution decays exponentially, and obtain a phase transition of the exponential integrability of the edge cover time with critical exponent $\alpha_c^1(\delta)$, which has a variational representation and some interesting analytic properties including $\alpha_c^1(0+)$ reflecting the graph structures.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Markov property on planar maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit, in a self contained way, the Markov property on planar maps and decorated planar maps from three perspectives. First, we characterize the laws on these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting invariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps, satisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to those obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the Boltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that halt exploration mid-edge.</description>

      <title>The Brownian marble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R:(0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ be a measurable function. Consider a family of coalescing Brownian motions started from every point in the subset $\{ (0,x) : x \in \mathbb{R} \}$ of $[0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}$ and proceeding according to the following rule: the interval $\{t\} \times [L_t,U_t]$ between two consecutive Brownian motions instantaneously `fragments' at rate $R(U_t - L_t)$. At such a fragmentation event at a time $t$, we initiate new coalescing Brownian motions from each of the points $\{ (t,x) : x \in [L_t,U_t]\}$. The resulting process, which we call the $R$-marble, is easily constructed when $R$ is bounded, and may be considered a random subset of the Brownian web.
  Under mild conditions, we show that it is possible to construct the $R$-marble when $R$ is unbounded as a limit as $n \to \infty$ of $R_n$-marbles where $R_n(g) = R(g) \wedge n$. The behaviour of this limiting process is mainly determined by the shape of $R$ near zero. The most interesting case occurs when the limit $\lim_{g \downarrow 0} g^2 R(g) = \lambda$ exists in $(0,\infty)$, in which we find a phase transition. For $\lambda \geq 6$, the limiting object is indistinguishable from the Brownian web, whereas if $\lambda &lt; 6$, then the limiting object is a nontrivial stochastic process with large gaps.
  When $R(g) = \lambda/g^2$, the $R$-marble is a self-similar stochastic process which we refer to as the \emph{Brownian marble} with parameter $\lambda &gt; 0$. We give an explicit description of the space-time correlations of the Brownian Marble, which can be described in terms of an object we call the Brownian vein; a spatial version of a recurrent extension of a killed Bessel-$3$ process.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regularized Optimal Transport without Curse of Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport -- the optimal transport problem regularized by KL diver\-gence -- is highly successful in statistical applications. Thanks to the smoothness of the entropic coupling, its sample complexity avoids the curse of dimensionality suffered by unregularized optimal transport. The flip side of smoothness is overspreading: the entropic coupling always has full support, whereas the unregularized coupling that it approximates is usually sparse, even given by a map. Regularizing optimal transport by less-smooth $f$-divergences such as Tsallis divergence (i.e., $L^p$-regularization) is known to allow for sparse approximations, but is often thought to suffer from the curse of dimensionality as the couplings have limited differentiability and the dual is not strongly concave. We refute this conventional wisdom and show, for a broad family of divergences, that the key empirical quantities converge at the parametric rate, independently of the dimension. More precisely, we provide central limit theorems for the optimal cost, the optimal coupling, and the dual potentials induced by i.i.d.\ samples from the marginals. These results are obtained by a powerful yet elementary approach that is of broader interest for Z-estimation in function classes that are not Donsker.</description>

      <title>Multiserver-job Response Time under Multilevel Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multiserver-job setting in the load-focused multilevel scaling limit, where system load approaches capacity much faster than the growth of the number of servers $n$.
  We specifically consider the ``1 and $n$'' system, where each job requires either one server or all $n$ servers. Within the multilevel scaling limit, we examine three regimes: load dominated by $n$-server jobs, 1-server jobs, or balanced. In each regime, we characterize the asymptotic growth rate of the boundary of the stability region and the scaled mean queue length.
  We numerically verify our asymptotic results against exact formulae.</description>

We define the {\em pressure out of equilibrium} for such a family of potentials, and prove a corresponding variational principle. We present an application to random dynamical systems. In particular, we study an open condition for random dynamical systems where the randomness is driven by a Gibbs process, and prove hyperbolicity estimates that were previously only known in the i.i.d setting.</description>

      <title>Assessing Risk Heterogeneity through Heavy-Tailed Frequency and Severity Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In operational risk management and actuarial finance, the analysis of risk often begins by dividing a random damage-generation process into its separate frequency and severity components. In the present article, we construct canonical families of mixture distributions for each of these components, based on a Negative Binomial kernel for frequency and a Gamma kernel for severity. The mixtures are employed to assess the heterogeneity of risk factors underlying an empirical distribution through the shape of the implied mixing distribution. From the duality of the Negative Binomial and Gamma distributions, we first derive necessary and sufficient conditions for heavy-tailed (i.e., inverse power-law) canonical mixtures. We then formulate flexible 4-parameter families of mixing distributions for Geometric and Exponential kernels to generate heavy-tailed 4-parameter mixture models, and extend these mixtures to arbitrary Negative Binomial and Gamma kernels, respectively, yielding 5-parameter mixtures for detecting and measuring risk heterogeneity. To check the robustness of such heterogeneity inferences, we show how a fitted 5-parameter model may be re-expressed in terms of alternative Negative Binomial or Gamma kernels whose associated mixing distributions form a "calibrated" family.</description>

      <title>A mixed finite element method for a class of fourth-order stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully discrete, semi-implicit mixed finite element method for approximating solutions to a class of fourth-order stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz and non-monotone nonlinearities, perturbed by spatially smooth multiplicative Gaussian noise. The proposed scheme is applicable to a range of physically relevant nonlinear models, including the stochastic Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar (sLLBar) equation, the stochastic convective Cahn--Hilliard equation with mass source, and the stochastic regularised Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (sLLB) equation, among others. To overcome the difficulties posed by the interplay between the nonlinearities and the stochastic forcing, we adopt a `truncate-then-discretise' strategy: the nonlinear term is first truncated before discretising the resulting modified problem. We show that the strong solution to the truncated problem converges in probability to that of the original problem. A fully discrete numerical scheme is then proposed for the truncated system, and we establish both convergence in probability and strong convergence (with quantitative rates) for the two fields used in the mixed formulation.</description>

      <title>Angles of orthocentric simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional simplex in Euclidean space is called orthocentric if all of its altitudes intersect at a single point, referred to as the orthocenter. We explicitly compute the internal and external angles at all faces of an orthocentric simplex. To this end, we introduce a parametric family of polyhedral cones, called orthocentric cones, and derive formulas for their angles and, more generally, for their conic intrinsic volumes.
  We characterize the tangent and normal cones of orthocentric simplices in terms of orthocentric cones with explicit parameters. Depending on whether the orthocenter lies inside the simplex, on its boundary, or outside, the simplex is classified as acute, rectangular, or obtuse, respectively. The solid angle formulas differ in these three cases.
  As a probabilistic application of the angle formulas, we explicitly compute the expected number of $k$-dimensional faces and the expected volume of the random polytope $[g_1/\tau_1, \ldots, g_n/\tau_n]$, where $g_1, \ldots, g_n$ are independent standard Gaussian vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and $\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n &gt; 0$ are constants.</description>

      <title>ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while also achieving faster convergence.</description>

      <title>Loss-Versus-Rebalancing under Deterministic and Generalized block-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although modern blockchains almost universally produce blocks at fixed intervals, existing models still lack an analytical formula for the loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) incurred by Automated Market Makers (AMMs) liquidity providers in this setting. Leveraging tools from random walk theory, we derive the following closed-form approximation for the per block per unit of liquidity expected LVR under constant block time:
  \[ \overline{\mathrm{ARB}}= \frac{\,\sigma_b^{2}} {\,2+\sqrt{2\pi}\,\gamma/(|\zeta(1/2)|\,\sigma_b)\,}+O\!\bigl(e^{-\mathrm{const}\tfrac{\gamma}{\sigma_b}}\bigr)\;\approx\; \frac{\sigma_b^{2}}{\,2 + 1.7164\,\gamma/\sigma_b}, \] where $\sigma_b$ is the intra-block asset volatility, $\gamma$ the AMM spread and $\zeta$ the Riemann Zeta function. Our large Monte Carlo simulations show that this formula is in fact quasi-exact across practical parameter ranges.
  Extending our analysis to arbitrary block-time distributions as well, we demonstrate both that--under every admissible inter-block law--the probability that a block carries an arbitrage trade converges to a universal limit, and that only constant block spacing attains the asymptotically minimal LVR. This shows that constant block intervals provide the best possible protection against arbitrage for liquidity providers. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>The Ergodic Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control Problems for Stochastic Mean-Field Systems with Periodic Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the ergodic linear-quadratic closed-loop optimal control problems, in which the state equation is the mean-field stochastic differential equation with periodic coefficients. We first study the asymptotic behavior of the solution to the state equation and get a family of periodic measures depending on time variables within a period from the convergence of transition probabilities. Then, with the help of periodic measures and periodic Riccati equations, we transform the ergodic cost functional on infinite horizon into an equivalent cost functional on a single periodic interval without limit, and present the closed-loop optimal controls for our concerned control system. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove a regularization by noise phenomenon for the energy-critical and mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. We show that for any deterministic data, the probability that the corresponding solution exists globally and scatters goes to one as the strength of the non-conservative noise goes to infinity. The proof relies on the rescaling transform and a new observation on the rapid uniform decay of geometric Brownian motions after short time.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for empirical measures of once-reinforced random walks on finite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\delta$ once-reinforced random walks ($\delta$-ORRWs) are a type of self-interacting random walks defined on connected graphs with reinforcement factor $\delta&gt;0$, moving to neighbours for each step. The transition probability is proposional to weights of edges, where the weights are $1$ on edges not traversed and $\delta$ otherwise. In this paper, we show a general version of large deviation principle for empirical measures of $\delta$-ORRWs on finite connected graphs by a modified weak convergence approach. We also obtain a phase transition of the rate function of large deviation principle with critical point $\delta_c=1$.</description>

Abstract: The log-Harnack inequality and Bismut formula are established for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with singularities in all (time, space, distribution) variables, where the drift satisfies an integrability condition in time-space, and the continuity in distribution may be weaker than Dini.
  The main results considerably improve the existing ones for the case where the drift is $L$-differentiable and Lipschitz continuous in distribution with respect to the 2-Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>Tip growth in a strongly concentrated aggregation model follows local geodesics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the aggregate Loewner evolution (ALE), introduced in 2018 by Sola, Turner and Viklund to generalise versions of diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) in the plane using complex analysis. They showed convergence of the ALE for certain parameters to a single growing slit. Started from a non-trivial initial configuration of $k$ needles and the same parameters, we show that the small-particle scaling limit of ALE is the Laplacian path model, introduced by Carleson and Makarov in 2002, in which the tips grow along geodesics towards $\infty$.
  The proof of this result involves analysis of Loewner's equation near its singular points, and we extend usual martingale methods to this setting. Most conformal growth models introduce an extra regularisation factor to deal with the singularities in Loewner's equation at the sharp tips and right-angle bases of slit particles. As an intermediate step we prove a limit result for a model with no such regularisation factor, developing methods which should prove useful in analysing other weakly-regularised models with non-trivial limits.</description>

Abstract: We study the 2d directed polymer in random environment in a novel *quasi-critical regime*, which interpolates between the much studied sub-critical and critical regimes. We prove Edwards-Wilkinson fluctuations throughout the quasi-critical regime, showing that the diffusively rescaled partition functions are asymptotically Gaussian. We deduce a corresponding result for the critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow. A key challenge is the lack of hypercontractivity, which we overcome deriving new moment estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13400v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we establish Malliavin differentiability of McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations (MV-SDEs) with drifts satisfying both a locally Lipschitz and a one-sided Lipschitz assumption, and where the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be uniformly Lipschitz in its variables.
  As a secondary contribution, we investigate how Malliavin differentiability transfers across the interacting particle system associated with the McKean-Vlasov equation to its limiting equation. This final result requires both spatial and measure differentiability of the coefficients and doubles as a standalone result of independent interest since the study of Malliavin derivatives of weakly interacting particle systems seems novel to the literature. The presentation is didactic and finishes with a discussion on mollification techniques for the Lions derivative.</description>

      <title>Martingale Suitable Weak Solutions of $3$-D Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Vorticity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct martingale suitable weak solutions for $3$-dimensional incompressible stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with generally non-linear noise. In deterministic setting, as widely known, ``suitable weak solutions'' are Leray-Hopf weak solutions enjoying two different types of local energy inequalities (LEIs). In stochastic setting, we apply the idea of ``martingale solution", avoid transforming to random system, and show new stochastic versions of the two local energy inequalities. In particular, in additive and linear multiplicative noise case, OU-processes and the exponential formulas DO NOT play a role in our formulation of LEIs. This is different to \cite{FR02,Rom10} where the additive noise case is dealt. Also, we successfully apply the concept of ``a.e. super-martingale'' to describe this local energy behavior. To relate the well-known ``dissipative weak solutions" come up with in \cite{DR00}, we derive a local energy equality and extend the concept onto stochastic setting naturally. For further regularity of solutions, we are able to bound the $L^\infty\big([0,T];L^1(\Omega\times\mathbb T^3)\big)$ norm of the vorticity and $L^{\frac{4}{3+\delta}}\big(\Omega\times[0,T]\times\mathbb T^3\big)$ norm of the gradient of the vorticity, in case that the initial vorticity is a finite regular signed measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogous to Kolmogorov's theorem for the existence of stochastic processes describing random functions, we consider theorems for the existence of stochastic processes describing random measures, as limits of inverse measure systems. Specifically, given a coherent inverse system of random (bounded/signed/positive/probability) histograms on refining partitions, we study conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a corresponding random inverse limit, a Radon probability measure on the space of (bounded/signed/positive/probability) measures. Depending on the topology (vague/tight/weak/total-variational) and Kingman's notion of complete randomness, the limiting random measure is in one of four phases, distinguished by their degrees of concentration (support/domination/discreteness). Results are applied in the well-known Dirichlet and Polya tree families of random probability measures and in a new Gaussian family of signed inverse limit measures. In these three families, examples of all four phases occur and we describe the corresponding conditions on defining parameters.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of heavy-tailed distributions for which any weighted average of independent and identically distributed random variables is larger than one such random variable in (usual) stochastic order. We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\'echet, and Burr distributions, belong to this class. The established stochastic dominance relation can be further generalized to allow negatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In particular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random variables dominates their distribution mixtures in stochastic order.</description>

This inequality is better than an inequality of the same type as the Gaussian correlation inequality for distribution functions. An important example are some multivariate chi-square distributions, derived from the diagonal of a Wishart matrix.</description>

In the present paper we make a detailed study of the tail asymptotics of the limiting gap statistics of the directions, for certain specific classes of planar quasicrystals.</description>

Abstract: Statistical field theory methods have been very successful with a number of random graph and random matrix problems, but it is challenging to apply these methods to graphs with prescribed degree sequences due to the extensive number of constraints that enforce the desired degree at each vertex. Building on top of recent results where similar methods are applied to random regular graph counting, we develop an accurate statistical field theory description for the adjacency matrix spectra of graphs with prescribed degrees. For large graphs, the expectation values are dominated by functional saddle points satisfying explicit equations. For the case of regular graphs, this immediately leads to the known McKay distribution. We then consider mixed-regular graphs with N1 vertices of degree d1, N2 vertices of degree d2, etc, such that the ratios N_i/N are kept fixed as N goes to infinity. For such graphs, the eigenvalue densities are governed by nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. Solving these equations numerically reproduces with an excellent accuracy the empirical eigenvalue distributions.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, with a parameter $\be^2 &gt; 0$, and its associated Gibbs dynamics on the two-dimensional torus. By introducing a physical space approach to the Fourier restriction norm method and establishing nonlinear dispersive smoothing for the imaginary multiplicative Gaussian chaos, we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model beyond the first threshold $\be^2 = 2\pi$. The deterministic step of our argument hinges on establishing key bilinear estimates, featuring weighted bounds for cone multipliers. Moreover, the probabilistic component involves a careful analysis of the imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos and reduces to integrating singularities along space-time light cones. As a by-product of our proof, we identify $\be^2 = 6\pi$ as a critical threshold for the hyperbolic sine-Gordon model, which is quite surprising given that the associated parabolic model has a critical threshold at $\be^2 =8\pi$.</description>

      <title>Modular Debiasing: A Robust Method for Quantum Randomness Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel modular debiasing technique applicable to any discrete random source, addressing the fundamental challenge of reliably extracting high-quality randomness from inherently imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework, utilizing probability generating functions and roots of unity, demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the exponential convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\{0, 1, \dots, m-1\}$. A key theoretical result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, crucially, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise, which are common in physical systems. Analytical bounds quantify this exponential rate of convergence, and are empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, strong theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs), offering an efficient method for extracting high-quality randomness resilient to experimental imperfections. This work contributes a valuable tool to the field of Quantum Information Science.</description>

      <title>Sibuya probability distributions and numerical evaluation of fractional-order operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the Sibuya discrete probability distribution, which serves as the basis and the main instrument for numerical simulations of Grunwald--Letnikov fractional derivatives by the Monte Carlo method. We provide three methods for simulating the Sibuya distribution. We also introduce the Sibuya-like sieved probability distributions, and apply them to numerical fractional-order differentiation. Additionally, we use the Monte Carlo method for evaluating fractional-order integrals, and suggest the notion of the continuous Sibuya probability distribution. The developed methods and tools are illustrated by examples of computation. We provide the MATLAB toolboxes for simulation of the Sibuya probability distribution, and for the numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Thinning-Stable Point Processes as a Model for Spatial Burstiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern telecommunications, spatial burstiness of data traffic
  poses challenges to traditional Poisson-based models. This paper
  describes application of thinning-stable point processes,
  which provide a more appropriate framework for modeling bursty
  spatial data. We discuss their properties, representation, inference
  methods, and applications, demonstrating the advantages over
  classical approaches.</description>
