      <title>Topological $\Delta G$ homology of rings with twisted $G$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unifying framework for studying variants of topological Hochschild homology such as Real topological Hochschild homology. Associated to a crossed simplicial group $\Delta G$, a category that generalizes Connes' cyclic category, we introduce an invariant of rings with twisted $G$-action, which we call topological $\Delta G$-homology. Here a ring with twisted $G$-action is a common generalization of a ring with involution and a ring with $G$-action.
  Our construction provides homotopical analogues of quaternionic homology, symmetric homology, braid homology, and hyperoctahedral homology defined by Fiedorowicz--Loday. In the quaternionic case our construction, called quaternionic topological Hochschild homology, is equipped with a left Pin(2)-action and we compute it for loop spaces with a twisted $C_4$-action. As an important step along the way, we introduce a new family of crossed simplicial groups called the twisted symmetric crossed simplicial groups and we prove that they corresponds to operads for algebras with twisted $G$-action.</description>

      <title>Counting Components of Hurwitz Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, we describe the asymptotic growth of the number of connected components of Hurwitz spaces of marked $G$-covers (of both the affine and projective lines) whose monodromy classes are constrained in a certain way, as the number of branch points grows to infinity. More precisely, we compute both the exponent and (in many cases) the coefficient of the leading monomial in the count of components containing covers whose monodromy group is a given subgroup of $G$. By the work of Ellenberg, Tran, Venkatesh and Westerland, this asymptotic behavior is related to the distribution of field extensions of~$\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ with Galois group $G$.</description>

      <title>A survey of simplicial, relative, and chain complex homology theories for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs have seen widespread applications in network and data science communities in recent years. We present a survey of recent work to define topological objects from hypergraphs -- specifically simplicial, relative, and chain complexes -- that can be used to build homology theories for hypergraphs. We define and describe nine different homology theories and their relevant topological objects. We discuss some interesting properties of each method to show how the hypergraph structures are preserved or destroyed by modifying a hypergraph. Finally, we provide a series of illustrative examples by computing many of these homology theories for small hypergraphs to show the variability of the methods and build intuition.</description>

      <title>Modulo $\tau^{p-1}$ motivic Hochschild homology of modulo $p$ motivic cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the motivic Greenlees spectral sequence from arXiv:2408.00338 to compute Hochschild homology in the stable motivic homotopy category over an algebraically closed field. Our target is $MHH(M\mathbb{Z}/p)/\tau^{p-1}$, where $M\mathbb{Z}/p$ is modulo $p$ motivic cohomology, $p$ a prime number different from the characteristic of the base.</description>

      <title>A [Chern] character defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology rings of tiling spaces $\Omega$ given by cubical substitutions. While there have been many calculations before of cohomology groups of such tiling spaces, the innovation here is that we use computer-assisted methods to compute the cup-product structure. This leads to examples of substitution tilings with isomorphic cohomology groups but different cohomology rings. Part of the interest in studying the cup product comes from Bellissard's gap-labeling conjecture, which is known to hold in dimensions $\le 3$, but where a proof is known in dimensions $\ge 4$ only when the Chern character from $K^0(\Omega)$ to $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Q})$ lands in $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Z})$. Computation of the cup product on cohomology often makes it possible to compute the Chern character. We introduce a natural generalization of the gap-labeling conjecture, called the equivariant gap-labeling conjecture, which applies to tilings with a finite symmetry group. Again this holds in dimensions $\le 3$, but we are able to show that it fails in general in dimensions $\ge 4$. This, plus some of our cup product calculations, makes it plausible that the gap-labeling conjecture might fail in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cohomological characterisation of hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any geodesic metric space $X$, we give a complete cohomological characterisation of the hyperbolicity of $X$ in terms of vanishing of its second $\ell^{\infty}$-cohomology. We extend this result to the relative setting of $X$ with a collection of uniformly hyperbolic subgraphs. As an application, we give a cohomological characterisation of acylindrical hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Parametrized (higher) semiadditivity and the universality of spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiadditivity of an $\infty$-category, i.e.\ the existence of biproducts, provides it with useful algebraic structure in the form of a canonical enrichment in commutative monoids. This ultimately comes from the fact that the $\infty$-category of commutative monoids is the universal semiadditive $\infty$-category equipped with a finite-product-preserving functor to spaces, or equivalently that the $(2,1)$-category of spans of finite sets is the universal semiadditive $\infty$-category. In this article, we prove a vast generalization of these facts in the context of parametrized semiadditivity, a notion we define using Hopkins--Lurie's framework of ambidexterity. This simultaneously generalizes a result of Harpaz for higher semiadditivity and a result of Nardin for equivariant semiadditivity. We deduce that every parametrized semiadditive $\infty$-category is canonically enriched in Mackey functors/sheaves with transfers.
  As an application, we reprove the Mackey functor description of global spectra first obtained by the second-named author and generalize it to $G$-global spectra. Moreover, we obtain universal characterizations of the $\infty$-categories of $\Z$-valued $G$-Mackey profunctors and of quasi-finitely genuine $G$-spectra as studied by Kaledin and Krause--McCandless--Nikolaus, respectively.</description>

      <title>The directed Vietoris-Rips complex and homotopy and singular homology groups of finite digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove analogues of classical results for higher homotopy groups and singular homology groups of pseudotopological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces are a generalization of (\v{C}ech) closure spaces which are in turn a generalization of topological spaces. Pseudotopological spaces also include graphs and directed graphs as full subcategories. Thus they are a bridge that connects classical algebraic topology with the more applied side of topology. More specifically, we show the existence of a long exact sequence for homotopy groups of pairs of pseudotopological spaces and that a weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms for homology groups. Our main result is the construction of weak homotopy equivalences between the geometric realizations of directed Vietoris-Rips complexes and their underlying directed graphs. This implies that singular homology groups of finite directed graphs can be efficiently calculated from finite combinatorial structures, despite their associated chain groups being infinite dimensional. This work is similar to the work of McCord for finite topological spaces but in the context of pseudotopological spaces. Our results also give a novel approach for studying (higher) homotopy groups of discrete mathematical structures such as (directed) graphs or digital images.</description>
