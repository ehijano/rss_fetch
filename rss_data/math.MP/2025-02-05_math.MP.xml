      <title>On the fluxes induced by interacting fields in multiple scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple scattering problems involving point-source excitation of lossy media are considered. The sound fluxes induced by the interactions between the scattered fields are analyzed. Theorems connecting interaction intensities (active and reactive) with the Lagrangian densities and the scattering cross sections are established. Physical bounds regarding cross sections ratios are derived, highlighting the contribution of the interaction-induced intensities to the overall intensity. Explicit results for lossless clusters are given. The case of a cluster composed by point-like scatterers is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Localization phenomena in the random XXZ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the infinite random Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain exhibits, with probability one, spectral, eigenstate, and weak dynamical localization in an arbitrary (but fixed) energy interval in a non-trivial parameters range. The crucial step in the argument is a proof that if the Green functions for the associated finite systems Hamiltonians exhibit certain (volume-dependent) decay properties in a fixed energy interval, then the infinite volume Green function decays in the same interval as well. The pertinent finite systems decay properties for the random XXZ model had been previously verified by the authors.</description>

      <title>Sub-Power Law Decay of the Wave Packet Maximum in Disordered Anharmonic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the peak of an initially localized wave packet in one-dimensional nonlinear disordered chains decays more slowly than any power law of time. The systems under investigation are Klein-Gordon and nonlinear disordered Schr\"odinger-type chains, characterized by a harmonic onsite disordered potential and quartic nearest-neighbor coupling. Our results apply in the long-time limit, hold almost surely, and are valid for arbitrary finite energy values.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of $\lambda \phi_2^4$- theory in 2-d Moyal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the conjecture that the $\lambda \phi^4$ QFT- model on 4-dimensional non-commutative Moyal space can be non-perturbatively constructed. As preparation, in this paper we construct the 2-dimensional case with the method of stochastic quantization. We show the local well-posedness and global well-posedness of the stochastic quantization equation, leading to a construction of the Moyal $\lambda \phi^4_2$ measure for any non-negative coupling constant $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Tail bounds for the Dyson series of random Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$ with random potentials of strength $\lambda$. Our main result gives tail bounds for the terms of the Dyson series that are effective at time scales on the order of $\lambda^{-2+\varepsilon}$. As corollaries, we obtain estimates on the frequency localization and spatial delocalization of approximate eigenfunctions in the spirit of works by Schlag-Shubin-Wolff and T. Chen. These estimates also apply to Floquet states associated to time-periodic potentials. Our proof is elementary in that we use neither sophisticated harmonic analysis nor diagrammatic arguments. Instead, we use only the noncommutative Khintchine inequality from random matrix theory combined with pointwise dispersive estimates for the free Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Instabilities in visco-thermodiffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometrical optics approach has been used to derive instability criteria for various swirling flows observed in nature and industrial processes. By applying a short-wavelength local analysis to the Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the energy equation when necessary, we account for viscosity and thermal diffusivity effects. The derived criteria are validated for swirling flows modeled by a cylindrical differentially rotating annulus with axial flow induced by either a sliding inner cylinder, an axial pressure gradient, or a radial temperature gradient combined with vertical gravity. These criteria successfully reproduce known results from numerical linear stability analysis and agree with experimental and simulation data. Moreover, they unify and extend several classical instability criteria: the Rayleigh criterion for centrifugally-driven instabilities, the Ludwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson criterion for isothermal swirling flows, and the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke criterion for non-isothermal azimuthal flows. Additionally, they predict oscillatory modes in swirling flows, thereby generalizing the McIntyre instability criterion to these systems.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent quantum geometric tensor and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a time-dependent extension of the quantum geometric tensor to describe the geometry of the time-parameter space for a quantum state, by considering small variations in both time and wave function parameters. Compared to the standard quantum geometric tensor, this tensor introduces new temporal components, enabling the analysis of systems with non-time-separable or explicitly time-dependent quantum states and encoding new information about these systems. In particular, the time-time component of this tensor is related to the energy dispersion of the system. We applied this framework to a harmonic/inverted oscillator, a time-dependent harmonic oscillator, and a chain of generalized harmonic/inverted oscillators. We show some results on the scalar curvature associated with the time-dependent quantum geometric tensor and the generalized Berry curvature behavior on the transition from harmonic oscillators to inverted ones. Furthermore, we analyze the entanglement for the chain through purity analysis, obtaining that the purity for any excited state is zero in the mentioned transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum expanders and property (T) discrete quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Families of expander graphs were first constructed by Margulis from discrete groups with property (T). Within the framework of quantum information theory, several authors have generalised the notion of an expander graph to the setting of quantum channels. In this work, we use discrete quantum groups with property (T) to construct quantum expanders in two ways. The first approach obtains a quantum expander family by constructing the requisite quantum channels directly from finite-dimensional irreducible unitary representations, extending earlier work of Harrow using groups. The second approach directly generalises Margulis' original construction and is based on a quantum analogue of a Schreier graph using the theory of coideals. To obtain examples of quantum expanders, we apply our machinery to discrete quantum groups with property (T) coming from compact bicrossed products.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the high-power behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high-power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only {\it off-diagonally} across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The later are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of renormalized operators at higher powers in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with damping, detuning and driving terms, introduced as a model for Kerr combs generation in ring-shape resonators and more recently, in the form of a variant, in Fabry-Perot (FP) resonators. The aim of this paper is to present some numerical methods that complement each other to solve the LLE in its general form both in the dynamic and in the steady state regimes. We also provide some mathematical properties of the LLE likely to help the understanding and interpretation of the numerical simulation results.</description>

      <title>Rigorous analysis of large-space and long-time asymptotics for the short-pulse soliton gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the asymptotics of soliton gases to the short-pulse (SP) equation. The soliton gas is formulated in terms of a RH problem, which is derived from the RH problems of the $N$-soliton solutions with $N \to \infty$. Building on prior work in the study of the KdV soliton gas and orthogonal polynomials with Jacobi-type weights, we extend the reflection coefficient to two generalized forms on the interval $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$: $r_0(\lambda) = \left(\lambda - \eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2 - \lambda\right)^{\beta_2}|\lambda - \eta_0|^{\beta_0}\gamma(\lambda)$, $r_c(\lambda) = \left(\lambda - \eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2 - \lambda\right)^{\beta_2}\chi_c(\lambda)\gamma(\lambda)$, where $0 &lt; \eta_1 &lt; \eta_0 &lt; \eta_2$ and $\beta_j &gt; -1$ ($j = 0, 1, 2$), $\gamma(\lambda)$ is continuous and positive on $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$, with an analytic extension to a neighborhood of this interval, $\chi_c(\lambda) = 1$ for $\lambda \in \left[\eta_1, \eta_0\right)$ and $\chi_c(\lambda) = c^2$ for $\lambda \in \left(\eta_0, \eta_2\right]$, where $c&gt;0$ with $c \neq 1$. The asymptotic analysis is performed using the steepest descent method. A key aspect of the analysis is the construction of the $g$-function. To address the singularity at the origin, we introduce an innovative piecewise definition of $g$-function. To establish the order of the error term, we construct local parametrices near $\eta_j$ for $j = 1, 2$, and singularity $\eta_0$. At the endpoints, we employ the Airy parametrix and the first type of modified Bessel parametrix. At the singularity $\eta_0$, we use the second type of modified Bessel parametrix for $r_0$ and confluent hypergeometric parametrix for $r_c(\lambda)$.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics for the $N_{\infty}$-soliton solution to the KdV equation with two types of generalized reflection coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the long-time asymptotics for the $N_{\infty}$-soliton solution to the KdV equation in the different regions with the aid of the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems with two types of generalized reflection coefficients on the interval $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]\in \mathbb{R}^+$: $r_0(\lambda,\eta_0; \beta_0, \beta_1,\beta_2)=\left(\lambda-\eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2-\lambda\right)^{\beta_2}\left|\lambda-\eta_0\right|^{\beta_0}\gamma\left(\lambda\right)$, $r_c(\lambda,\eta_0; \beta_1,\beta_2)=\left(\lambda-\eta_1\right)^{\beta_1}\left(\eta_2-\lambda\right)^{\beta_2}\chi_c\left(\lambda, \eta_0\right)\gamma \left(\lambda\right)$, where the singularity $\eta_0\in (\eta_1, \eta_2)$ and $\beta_j&gt;-1$ ($j=0, 1, 2$), $\gamma: \left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right] \to\mathbb{R}^+$ is continuous and positive on $\left[\eta_1, \eta_2\right]$, with an analytic extension to a neighborhood of this interval, and the step-like function $\chi_c$ is defined as $\chi_c\left(\lambda,\eta_0\right)=1$ for $\lambda\in\left[\eta_1, \eta_0\right)$ and $\chi_c\left(\lambda,\eta_0\right)=c^2$ for $\lambda\in\left(\eta_0, \eta_2\right]$ with $c&gt;0, \, c\ne1$. A critical step in the analysis of RH problems via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent technique is how to construct local parametrices around the endpoints $\eta_j$'s and the singularity $\eta_0$. Specifically, the modified Bessel functions of indexes $\beta_j$'s are utilized for the endpoints $\eta_j$'s, and the modified Bessel functions of index $\left(\beta_0\pm 1\right)\left/\right.2$ and confluent hypergeometric functions are employed around the singularity $\eta_0$ if the reflection coefficients are $r_0$ and $r_c$, respectively. This comprehensive study extends the understanding of generalized reflection coefficients and provides valuable insights into the asymptotics of soliton gases.</description>

      <title>Courant Algebroid Relations, T-Dualities and Generalised Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of Courant algebroid relation is used to introduce a definition of relation between divergence operators on Courant algebroids. By introducing invariant divergence operators, a notion of generalised T-duality between divergences is presented through an existence and uniqueness result for related divergence operators on T-dual pairs of exact Courant algebroids, which naturally incorporates the dilaton shift. When combined with the notion of generalised isometry, this establishes circumstances under which generalised Ricci tensors are related, proving that T-duality is compatible with generalised string background equations. This enables an analysis of the compatibility between T-duality and generalised Ricci flow, showing that the T-dual of a solution of generalised Ricci flow is also a solution of generalised Ricci flow.

      <title>Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Improved semiclassical eigenvalue estimates for the Laplacian and the Landau Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berezin--Li--Yau and the Kr\"oger inequalities show that Riesz means of order $\geq 1$ of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a domain $\Omega$ of finite measure are bounded in terms of their semiclassical limit expressions. We show that these inequalities can be improved by a multiplicative factor that depends only on the dimension and the product $\sqrt\Lambda |\Omega|^{1/d}$, where $\Lambda$ is the eigenvalue cut-off parameter in the definition of the Riesz mean. The same holds when $|\Omega|^{1/d}$ is replaced by a generalized inradius of $\Omega$. Finally, we show similar inequalities in two dimensions in the presence of a constant magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum Zernike Hamiltonians: Polynomial Higgs-type algebras and algebraic derivation of the spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum analog of the generalized Zernike systems given by the Hamiltonian: $$ \hat{\mathcal{H}} _N =\hat{p}_1^2+\hat{p}_2^2+\sum_{k=1}^N \gamma_k (\hat{q}_1 \hat{p}_1+\hat{q}_2 \hat{p}_2)^k , $$ with canonical operators $\hat{q}_i,\, \hat{p}_i$ and arbitrary coefficients $\gamma_k$. This two-dimensional quantum model, besides the conservation of the angular momentum, exhibits higher-order integrals of motion within the enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak h_2$. By constructing suitable combinations of these integrals, we uncover a polynomial Higgs-type symmetry algebra that, through an appropriate change of basis, gives rise to a deformed oscillator algebra. The associated structure function $\Phi$ is shown to factorize into two commuting components $\Phi=\Phi_1 \Phi_2$. This framework enables an algebraic determination of the possible energy spectra of the model for the cases $N=2,3,4$, the case $N=1$ being canonically equivalent to the harmonic oscillator. Based on these findings, we propose two conjectures which generalize the results for all $N\ge 2$ and any value of the coefficients $\gamma_k$, that they are explicitly proven for $N=5$. In addition, all of these results can be interpreted as superintegrable perturbations of the original quantum Zernike system corresponding to $N=2$ which are also analyzed and applied to the isotropic oscillator on the sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolated between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.</description>

      <title>Contextuality of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation, with deep connections to entanglement, magic, and uncertainty relations. Entanglement, for instance, has driven key advances like surface codes and has deepened our understanding of quantum gravity through holographic quantum codes. While these connections are well-explored, the role of contextuality, a fundamental non-classical feature of quantum theory, remains unexplored. Notably, Bell nonlocality is a special case of contextuality, and prior works have established contextuality as a key resource for quantum computational advantage.
  In this work, we establish the first direct link between contextuality and quantum error-correcting codes. Using a sheaf-theoretic framework, we define contextuality for such codes and prove key results on its manifestation. Specifically, we prove the equivalence of contextuality definitions from Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic framework and Kirby--Love's tree-based approach for the partial closure of Pauli measurement sets. We present several findings, including the proof of a conjecture by Kim and Abramsky [1]. We further show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual, while others are noncontextual. Our findings reveal a direct connection between contextuality and quantum error correction, offering new insights into the non-classical resources enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Energy field of critical Ising model and examples of singular fields in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove singularity of three natural fields in QFT with respect to their natural base measure. The fields we consider are the following ones:
  (1) The near-critical limit of the $2d$ Ising model (in the $\beta$-direction) is locally singular w.r.t the critical scaling limit of $2d$ Ising. (N.B. In the $h$-direction it is not locally singular).
  (2) The $2d$ Hierarchical Sine-Gordon field is singular w.r.t the $2d$ hierarchical Gaussian Free Field for all $\beta\in[\beta_{L^2}, \beta_{BKT})$.
  (3) The Hierarchical $\Phi^4_3$ field is singular w.r.t the $3d$ hierarchical GFF.
  Item (1) gives the first strong indication that the energy field of critical $2d$ Ising model does not exist as a random Schwarz distribution on the plane. Item (2) has been proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $2d$ Sine-Gordon sufficiently far from the BKT point in [GM24] while item (3) is proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $3d$ $\Phi^4_3$ field in [BG21, OOT21, HKN24].
  We believe our way to detect a singular behaviour at all scales is very much down to earth and may be applicable in all settings where one has a good enough control on the so-called effective potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that every algebraic quantum field theory has an underlying functorial field theory which is defined on a suitable globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordism pseudo-category. This means that globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordisms between Cauchy surfaces arise naturally in the context of algebraic quantum field theory. The underlying functorial field theory encodes the time evolution of the original theory, but not its spatially local structure. As an illustrative application of these results, the algebraic and functorial descriptions of a free scalar quantum field are compared in detail.</description>

      <title>The Brown measure of a sum of two free nonselfadjoint random variables, one of which is R-diagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are two $*$-free (generally unbounded) random variables with Brown measures $\mu_{X_{1}}$ and $\mu_{X_{2}}$, respectively. Using properties of classical free additive convolutions, we develop a method for calculating $\mu_{X_{1}+X_{2}}$when $X_{2}$ is $R$-diagonal. This method determines a density relative to Lebesgue measure on an open set whose closure contains the support of $\mu_{X_{1}+X_{2}}$. Effective calculations are possible in important cases. Biane and Lehner were the first to make significant progress on the problem we consider, even in some cases in which neither $X_{1}$ nor $X_{2}$ is $R$-diagonal. Our examples overlap with theirs, but we emphasize the use of subordination functions. When $X_{2}$ is circular, $\mu_{X_{1}+X_{2}}$ was studied earlier using two different approaches, one involving Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and another using standard free probability techniques. Our work extends the second approach.</description>

      <title>On the Emergent "Quantum" Theory in Complex Adaptive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the concept of emergent quantum-like theory in complex adaptive systems, and examine in particular the concrete example of such an emergent (or "mock") quantum theory in the Lotka-Volterra system. In general, we investigate the possibility of implementing the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics on classical systems, and what would be the conditions for using such an approach. We start from a standard description of a classical system via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation and reduce it to an effective Schr\"odinger-type equation, with a (mock) Planck constant $\mockbar$, which is system-dependent. The condition for this is that the so-called quantum potential VQ, which is state-dependent, is cancelled out by some additional term in the HJ equation. We consider this additional term to provide for the coupling of the classical system under consideration to the "environment." We assume that a classical system could cancel out the VQ term (at least approximately) by fine tuning to the environment. This might provide a mechanism for establishing a stable, stationary states in (complex) adaptive systems, such as biological systems. In this context we emphasize the state dependent nature of the mock quantum dynamics and we also introduce the new concept of the mock quantum, state dependent, statistical field theory. We also discuss some universal features of the quantum-to-classical as well as the mock-quantum-to-classical transition found in the turbulent phase of the hydrodynamic formulation of our proposal. In this way we reframe the concept of decoherence into the concept of "quantum turbulence," i.e. that the transition between quantum and classical could be defined in analogy to the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Transposed Poisson $3$-Lie algebra is a dual notion of Nambu-Poisson algebra of order 3. In this paper, we explicitly determine all $\frac{1}{3}$-derivations and automorphisms of the unique nontrivial $3$-dimensional complex $3$-Lie algebra $(A_3,[\cdot,\cdot,\cdot])$. Based on the one-one correspondence between $\frac{1}{3}$-derivations and transposed Poisson 3-Lie algebras, up to isomorphism, we classify transposed Poisson $3$-Lie algebras of dimension $3$ under the case that $L_{e_1}$ is trivial over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We establish (paying particular attention to large or small ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and of the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansion terms as linear combinations of higher-order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$ with rational polynomial coefficients. The parametrizations are fine-tuned so that the expansion coefficients in the Gaussian cases are, for given $n$, the limits $p\to\infty$ of those of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focusing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition to chaos in the subcritical regime of counter-rotating Taylor-Couette flow is investigated using a minimal periodic domain capable of sustaining coherent structures. Following a Feigenbaum cascade, the dynamics are found to be remarkably well approximated by a simple discrete map that admits rigorous proof of its chaotic nature. The chaotic set that arises for the map features densely distributed periodic points that are in one-to-one correspondence with unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the Navier-Stokes system. This supports the increasingly accepted view that UPOs may serve as the backbone of turbulence and, indeed, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct every statistical property of chaotic fluid flow from UPOs.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in Hamiltonian variational principles, Hamiltonian variational integrators, and their applications such as to optimization and control, we present a new Type II variational approach for Hamiltonian systems, based on a virtual work principle that enforces the Type II boundary conditions through a combination of essential and natural boundary conditions; particularly, this approach allows us to define this variational principle intrinsically on manifolds. We first develop this variational principle on vector spaces and subsequently extend it to parallelizable manifolds, general manifolds, as well as to the infinite-dimensional setting. Furthermore, we provide a review of variational principles for Hamiltonian systems in various settings as well as their applications.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model, the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>The spectral concentration for damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral distribution of damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds. Sj\"ostrand \cite{SJ1} proved that the imaginary parts of the majority of the eigenvalues concentrate near the average of the damping function, see also Anantharaman \cite{AN2}. In this paper, we prove that the most of eigenvalues actually lie in certain regions with imaginary parts that approach the average logarithmically as the real parts tend to infinity. The proof relies on the moderate deviation principles for Anosov geodesic flows. As an application, we show the concentration of non-trivial zeros of twisted Selberg zeta functions in a logarithmic region asymptotically close to $\Re s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Learning the Optimal Hydrodynamic Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the optimal hydrodynamic model for rarefied gas flows by combining the recent theory of slow spectral closure with machine learning techniques. We learn generalized transport coefficients from density fluctuation data and demonstrate that our approach decisively outperforms previously proposed constitutive laws for higher-order hydrodynamics. The novel hydrodynamic model is in extremely close alignment with the Shakhov kinetic model and DSMC data, thus proving the optimality of the slow spectral closure. Our theory is independent on any smallness assumption of the Knudsen number and is formulated solely in terms of macroscopic observables.</description>
