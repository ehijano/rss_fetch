      <title>Insights into Protein Unfolding under pH, Temperature, and Shear using Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein biologics hold immense potential in therapeutic applications, but their ephemeral nature has hindered their widespread application. The effects of different stressors on protein folding have long been studied, but whether these stressors induce protein unfolding through different pathways remains unclear. In this work, we conduct all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the unfolding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) under three distinct external stressors: high temperature, acidic pH, and shear stress. Our findings reveal that each stressor induces unique unfolding patterns in BSA, indicating stressor-specific unfolding pathways. Detailed structural analysis showed that high temperature significantly disrupts the protein's secondary structure, while acidic pH causes notable alterations in the tertiary structure, leading to domain separation and an extended shape. Shear stress initially perturbs the tertiary structure, initiating structural rearrangements followed by a loss of secondary structure. These distinct unfolding behaviors suggest that different stabilization strategies are required to enhance protein stability under various denaturation conditions. Insights from these unfolding studies can inform the design of materials, especially polymers, aimed at improving protein stability.</description>

      <title>One-step Structure Prediction and Screening for Protein-Ligand Complexes using Multi-Task Geometric Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of the protein-ligand complex is crucial to drug development. Existing virtual structure measurement and screening methods are dominated by docking and its derived methods combined with deep learning. However, the sampling and scoring methodology have largely restricted the accuracy and efficiency. Here, we show that these two fundamental tasks can be accurately tackled with a single model, namely LigPose, based on multi-task geometric deep learning. By representing the ligand and the protein pair as a graph, LigPose directly optimizes the three-dimensional structure of the complex, with the learning of binding strength and atomic interactions as auxiliary tasks, enabling its one-step prediction ability without docking tools. Extensive experiments show LigPose achieved state-of-the-art performance on major tasks in drug research. Its considerable improvements indicate a promising paradigm of AI-based pipeline for drug development.</description>

      <title>ProteinGPT: Multimodal LLM for Protein Property Prediction and Structure Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires detailed analysis of protein structures and sequences, a task in protein research that is inherently complex and time-consuming when performed manually. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multi-modal protein chat system, that allows users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive protein analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT seamlessly integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers for precise representation adaptation, coupled with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins with annotations, and optimize the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. This innovative system ensures accurate alignment between the user-uploaded data and prompts, simplifying protein analysis. Experiments show that ProteinGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions.</description>

      <title>Corrected Hill Function in Stochastic Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing reaction rates in stochastic bio-circuits is commonly done by directly introducing the deterministically deduced Hill function into the master equation. However, when fluctuations in enzymatic reaction rates are not neglectable, the Hill function must be derived, considering all the involved stochastic reactions. In this work, we derived the stochastic version of the Hill function from the master equation of the complete set of reactions that, in the macroscopic limit, lead to the Hill function reaction rate. We performed a series expansion around the average values of the concentrations, which allowed us to find corrections for the deterministic Hill function. This process allowed us to quantify the fluctuations of enzymatic reactions. We found that the underlying variability in propensity rates of gene regulatory networks has an important non-linear effect that reduces the intrinsic fluctuations of the mRNA and protein concentrations.</description>
