      <title>Holographic Beam Measurements of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of the holographic beam mapping program for the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). We describe the implementation of the holographic technique as adapted for CHIME, and introduce the processing pipeline which prepares the raw holographic timestreams for analysis of beam features. We use data from six bright sources across the full 400-800\,MHz observing band of CHIME to provide measurements of the co-polar and cross-polar beam response of CHIME in both amplitude and phase for the 1024 dual-polarized feeds instrumented on CHIME. In addition, we present comparisons with independent probes of the CHIME beam which indicate the presence of polarized beam leakage in CHIME. Holographic measurements of the CHIME beam have already been applied in science with CHIME, e.g. in estimating detection significance of far sidelobe FRBs, and in validating the beam models used for CHIME's first detections of \tcm emission (in cross-correlation with measurements of large-scale structure from galaxy surveys and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest). Measurements presented in this paper, and future holographic results, will provide a unique data set to characterize the CHIME beam and improve the experiment's prospects for a detection of BAO.</description>

      <title>Developing and implementing a CubeSat's equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the Bristol PROVE mission, a nano satellite in low Earth orbit will be required to track a ground based target during a 400 second flyover. This requires agile attitude control that will be achieved using a system of flywheels. To calculate the necessary torque from these flywheels, a controller was designed. Using newly derived equations of motion for the system, an expression to optimise the gains was produced. With this controller, simulations were run to evaluate the largest causes of error in target pointing. Disturbance torques were safely handled by the controller, but led to a 12% increase in wheel speeds, reaching 8325 rpm. This higher speed led to an increased gyroscopic torque, reaching 10^-7 Nm in the worst case. However since the flywheels can deliver 10^-5 Nm of torque, the controller could also correct for this. Hardware performance was then varied to assess the effect of each component on pointing accuracy. Attitude sensor noise was found to increase pointing error by 1.9 degrees in the worst case. Minimum performance requirements were then determined for each component in order to maintain an acceptable pointing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Advanced pure tilt actuator for testing tilt-to-length coupling in space-based gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling, caused by the jitter of test masses or satellites, is a significant noise source in space-based gravitational wave detection. Calibrating and suppressing TTL coupling noise at the sub-nanometer level is essential. One main challenge in current ground-based TTL coupling testing is the residual translational movement of the tilt actuator. This paper introduces the development of an advanced pure tilt actuator (APTA) specifically designed for testing TTL coupling. The APTA provides precise tilt motion and is monitored by a four-beam interferometer, which measures the displacement of attached array pyramids. We present a detailed theoretical model and experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that this optical test bed, equipped with the APTA, can achieve subnanometer-level TTL coupling calibration. In addition, a typical heterodyne interferometer was tested using the APTA test bed. Comparative testing demonstrated that the imaging system is capable of effectively suppressing TTL coupling errors. The TTL coupling coefficients were reduced from over plus-minus 30 micrometers per radian to within plus-minus 5 micrometers per radian across a range of plus-minus 200 microradians, meeting the preliminary requirements for the TianQin mission. This APTA test platform has the potential to be widely utilized for ground-based TTL coupling inspection.</description>

      <title>Study of Wide-Field-of-View X-ray Observations of the Virgo Cluster Using the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) is the pathfinder of the wide-field X-ray telescope used in the Einstein Probe mission. In this study, we present an image of the Virgo Cluster taken by LEIA in the 0.5-4.5 keV band with an exposure time of $\sim$17.3 ks in the central region. This extended emission is generally consistent with the results obtained by ROSAT. However, the field is affected by bright point sources due to the instrument's Point Spread Function (PSF) effect. Through fitting of the LEIA spectrum of the Virgo Cluster, we obtained a temperature of $2.1^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ keV, which is consistent with the XMM-Newton results ($\sim$2.3 keV). Above 1.6 keV, the spectrum is dominated by the X-ray background. In summary, this study validates LEIA's extended source imaging and spectral resolution capabilities for the first time.</description>

      <title>Approximating Rayleigh Scattering in Exoplanetary Atmospheres using Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an innovative application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle the intricate challenges of radiative transfer (RT) modeling in exoplanetary atmospheres, with a special focus on efficiently handling scattering phenomena. Traditional RT models often simplify scattering as absorption, leading to inaccuracies. Our approach utilizes PINNs, noted for their ability to incorporate the governing differential equations of RT directly into their loss function, thus offering a more precise yet potentially fast modeling technique. The core of our method involves the development of a parameterized PINN tailored for a modified RT equation, enhancing its adaptability to various atmospheric scenarios. We focus on RT in transiting exoplanet atmospheres using a simplified 1D isothermal model with pressure-dependent coefficients for absorption and Rayleigh scattering. In scenarios of pure absorption, the PINN demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting transmission spectra for diverse absorption profiles. For Rayleigh scattering, the network successfully computes the RT equation, addressing both direct and diffuse stellar light components. While our preliminary results with simplified models are promising, indicating the potential of PINNs in improving RT calculations, we acknowledge the errors stemming from our approximations as well as the challenges in applying this technique to more complex atmospheric conditions. Specifically, extending our approach to atmospheres with intricate temperature-pressure profiles and varying scattering properties, such as those introduced by clouds and hazes, remains a significant area for future development.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Viability Assessment for Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanetary science is increasingly prioritizing efforts toward direct imaging of planetary systems, with emphasis on those that may enable the detection and characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets. The recent 2020 Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey recommended the development of a space-based direct imaging mission that has subsequently been referred to as the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A fundamental challenge in the preparatory work for the HWO search for exo-Earths is the selection of suitable stellar targets. Much of the prior efforts regarding the HWO targets has occurred within the context of exoplanet surveys that have characterized the stellar properties for the nearest stars. The preliminary input catalog for HWO consists of 164 stars, of which 30 are known exoplanet hosts to 70 planets. Here, we provide a dynamical analysis for these 30 systems, injecting a terrestrial planet mass into the Habitable Zone (HZ) and determining the constraints on stable orbit locations due to the influence of the known planets. For each system, we calculate the percentage of the HZ that is dynamically viable for the potential presence of a terrestrial planet, providing an additional metric for inclusion of the stars within the HWO target list. Our analysis shows that, for 11 of the systems, less than 50% of the HZ is dynamically viable, primarily due to the presence of giant planets whose orbits pass near or through the HZ. These results demonstrate the impact that known system architectures can have on direct imaging target selection and overall system habitability.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Image Reconstruction using Closure Invariants and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interferometric closure invariants encode calibration-independent details of an object's morphology. Excepting simple cases, a direct backward transformation from closure invariants to morphologies is not well established. We demonstrate using simple Machine Learning models that closure invariants can aid in morphological classification and parameter estimation. We consider six phenomenologically parametrised morphologies: point-like, uniform circular disc, crescent, dual disc, crescent with elliptical accretion disc, and crescent with double jet lobes. Using logistic regression (LR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and random forest models on closure invariants obtained from a sparsely covered aperture, we find that all methods except LR can classify morphologies with $\gtrsim$80% accuracy, which improves with greater aperture coverage. Separately from the classification problem, given an independently confirmed class, we estimate parameters of uniform circular disc, crescent, and dual disc morphologies using simple MLP models, and parametrically reconstruct images. The estimated parameters and images correspond well with inputs, but the accuracy worsens when degeneracies between parameters are present. This independent approach to interferometric imaging under challenging observing conditions such as that faced by the Event Horizon Telescope and Very Long Baseline Interferometry in general can complement other methods in robustly constraining an object's morphology.</description>

      <title>Optical modeling of systematic uncertainties in detector polarization angles for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an estimate of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) detector polarization angle systematic uncertainty from optics perturbation analysis using polarization-sensitive ray tracing in CODE V optical design software. Uncertainties in polarization angle calibration in CMB measurements can limit constraints on cosmic birefringence and other cosmological parameters sensitive to polarization leakage. Our framework estimates the angle calibration systematic uncertainties from possible displacements in lens positions and orientations, and anti-reflection coating (ARC) thicknesses and refractive indices. With millimeter displacements in lens positions and percent-level perturbations in ARC thicknesses and indices from design, we find the total systematic uncertainty for three ACT detector arrays operating between 90--220 GHz to be at the tenth of degree scale. Reduced lens position and orientation uncertainties from physical measurements could lead to a reduction in the systematic uncertainty estimated with the framework presented here. This optical modeling may inform polarization angle systematic uncertainties for current and future microwave polarimeters, such as the CCAT Observatory, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Bayesian Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation to Exoplanet Atmospheric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, exoplanetary transmission spectra have yielded an unprecedented understanding about the physical and chemical nature of planets outside our solar system. Physical and chemical knowledge is mainly extracted via fitting competing models to spectroscopic data, based on some goodness-of-fit metric. However, current employed metrics shed little light on how exactly a given model is failing at the individual data point level and where it could be improved. As the quality of our data and complexity of our models increases, there is an urgent need to better understand which observations are driving our model interpretations. Here we present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to assess the performance of exoplanet atmospheric models and compute the expected log pointwise predictive density (elpd$_\text{LOO}$). elpd$_\text{LOO}$ estimates the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of an atmospheric model at data point resolution providing interpretable model criticism. We introduce and demonstrate this method on synthetic HST transmission spectra of a hot Jupiter. We apply elpd$_\text{LOO}$ to interpret current observations of HAT-P-41b and assess the reliability of recent inferences of H$^-$ in its atmosphere. We find that previous detections of H$^{-}$ are dependent solely on a single data point. This new metric for exoplanetary retrievals complements and expands our repertoire of tools to better understand the limits of our models and data. elpd$_\text{LOO}$ provides the means to interrogate models at the single data point level, a prerequisite for robustly interpreting the imminent wealth of spectroscopic information coming from JWST.</description>

      <title>Answers to frequently asked questions about the pulsar timing array Hellings and Downs curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the Hellings and Downs correlation curve -- the "smoking-gun" signature that pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have detected gravitational waves (GWs). Many of these questions arise from inadvertently applying intuition about the effects of GWs on LIGO-like detectors to the case of pulsar timing, where not all of it applies. This is because Earth-based detectors, like LIGO and Virgo, have arms that are short (km scale) compared to the wavelengths of the GWs that they detect (approx 100-10,000 km). In contrast, PTAs respond to GWs whose wavelengths (tens of light-years) are much shorter than their arms (a typical PTA pulsar is hundreds to thousands of light-years from Earth). To demonstrate this, we calculate the time delay induced by a passing GW along an Earth-pulsar baseline (a "one-arm, one-way" detector) and compare it in the "short-arm" (LIGO-like) and "long-arm" (PTA) limits. This provides qualitative and quantitative answers to many questions about the Hellings and Downs curve. The resulting FAQ sheet should help in understanding the "evidence for GWs" recently announced by several PTA collaborations.</description>

      <title>Signal-preserving CMB component separation with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of microwave sky signals, such as the cosmic microwave background, often requires component separation with multi-frequency methods, where different signals are isolated by their frequency behaviors. Many so-called "blind" methods, such as the internal linear combination (ILC), make minimal assumptions about the spatial distribution of the signal or contaminants, and only assume knowledge of the frequency dependence of the signal. The ILC is a minimum-variance linear combination of the measured frequency maps. In the case of Gaussian, statistically isotropic fields, this is the optimal linear combination, as the variance is the only statistic of interest. However, in many cases the signal we wish to isolate, or the foregrounds we wish to remove, are non-Gaussian and/or statistically anisotropic (in particular for Galactic foregrounds). In such cases, it is possible that machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to exploit the non-Gaussian features of the foregrounds and thereby improve component separation. However, many ML techniques require the use of complex, difficult-to-interpret operations on the data. We propose a hybrid method whereby we train an ML model using only combinations of the data that $\textit{do not contain the signal}$, and combine the resulting ML-predicted foreground estimate with the ILC solution to reduce the error from the ILC. We demonstrate our methods on simulations of extragalactic temperature and Galactic polarization foregrounds, and show that our ML model can exploit non-Gaussian features, such as point sources and spatially-varying spectral indices, to produce lower-variance maps than ILC - eg, reducing the variance of the B-mode residual by factors of up to 5 - while preserving the signal of interest in an unbiased manner. Moreover, we often find improved performance when applying our model to foreground models on which it was not trained.</description>

Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>
