      <title>Can 1957 cold-fusion explain 1989 cold-fusion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that muon-catalyzed nuclear fusion at ambient temperature takes place in deuterated metals is analyzed theoretically. It is suggested that the muon-catalyzed deuterium-deuterium (dd) or deuterium-tritium (dt) fusion rate, experimentally observed in liquid deuterium, increases in a PdD crystal. The main reason is that, in the palladium crystal matrix, deuterium diffuses in ionic (d+), rather than molecular (D2), form, thereby favoring the rate of (d$\mu$d)+ formation. The slightly enhanced deuterium density and the possibly reduced muon sticking probability (compared to liquid hydrogen) point to an increase of the fusion-rate, unfortunately counterbalanced by the probability of $\mu^-$ capture by the Pd nucleus, whose value should be evaluated by a dedicated experiment. If this mechanism were possible, we advance the hypothesis that 1989 cold fusion might have been randomly triggered by cosmic muons: an order-of-magnitude analysis shows that, under special conditions, a mW power per $\mu^-$ might be produced. Moreover, recent experimental results showing that neutrons can sustain deuterium fusion in out-of-equilibrium conditions might explain the remaining power generation. However, reliable quantitative figures are difficult to obtain theoretically, and an experiment is suggested, to be conducted at muon-beam sources, to verify or invalidate this idea.</description>

      <title>Gas-cell development for nuclear astrophysics motivated studies on noble gas targets and the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical nuclear physics experiments in most cases the target is solid, either in atomic or in molecular form. However, there are selected cases, where solid target is hardly be produced. Such a case is in particular, when the target is noble gas. In many astrophysical scenarios, such as big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), stellar hydrogen burning, and supernova explosions, alpha induced reactions on noble gas nuclei play a crucial role. Studying these reactions in the laboratory requires these noble gas atoms to be confined in a sufficient amount to allow the reactions. For example, in case of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction, both reactants are noble gases. The reaction cross section was experimentally determined in several works, however there are still energy regions lacking experimental data, rendering the extrapolations towards the astrophysically relevant energies uncertain. To be able to study among others the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction, a thin-windowed gas-cell target was developed, which can be used to study alpha induced reactions on noble gases leading to radioactive isotopes. The reaction product is collected inside a catcher foil to be analyzed later with gamma spectroscopy. Using the described gas-cell, new experimental total cross section of the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be reaction was determined in the energy range of $E_\mathrm{c.m.} = 2600-3000$~keV. These results confirm the overall trend, and also the absolute scale in this energy range. In addition, studying particle scattering with the same reactant as a radiative capture gives valuable information about the compound nucleus. The measured scattering cross section can be used forvalidations of theoretical reaction cross section estimates. For this aim, gas-cell was designed to study alpha scattering on noble gas target. A few test measurement is presented with the scattering gas-cell.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Design and Performance Simulation of a Thermal Neutron Diffractometer Using McStas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a preliminary design and simulation of a thermal neutron diffractometer using the McStas Monte Carlo ray-tracing package. The simulated system is based on generalized instrument parameters, including typical collimator divergences, monochromator mosaic spreads, and detector positioning, rather than on any specific engineering blueprint. The simulation evaluates key performance metrics such as neutron flux distribution, beam divergence, and wavelength resolution along the beam path.
  Results demonstrate that, even under simplified geometric assumptions, the model can provide insight into component alignment, resolution limitations, and flux attenuation behavior. The modular structure of the simulation allows easy parameter adjustments for different instrument configurations and serves as a foundation for more advanced system-specific optimization studies.
  Additionally, the provided McStas input file serves as a reusable and customizable simulation template that can significantly reduce modeling time for engineering personnel during the early-stage design and layout phase. This tool also facilitates technical training and comparative analysis without relying on finalized engineering drawings.</description>

      <title>Simulation of radiation damage effect on silicon detectors using RASER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon detectors play a crucial role in high energy physics experiments. In future high energy physics experiments, silicon detectors will be exposed to extremely high fluence environment, which can significantly affect their performance. It is important to understand the electrical behavior of detectors after irradiation. In this study, an irradiation simulation framework is constructed in RASER to simulate leakage current and charge collection effciency. The defect parameters are obtained from the Hamburg penta trap model (HPTM). Based on this work, we predict the similar silicon inner tracker which under a ten-year CEPC Higgs mode run can still maintain over 90% charge collection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Low dose gamma irradiation study of ATLAS ITk MD8 diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon strip detectors developed for the Inner Tracker (ITk) of the ATLAS experiment will operate in a harsh radiation environment of the HL-LHC accelerator. The ITk is thus designed to endure a total fluence of 1.6E15 1MeV n_eq/cm2 and a total ionizing dose (TID) of 66 Mrad in the strip detector region. A radiation-hard n^+-in-p technology is implemented in the ITk strip sensors. To achieve the required radiation hardness, extensive irradiation studies were conducted during sensor development, primarily performed up to the maximal expected total fluence and TID to ensure a full functionality of the detector at its end-of-life. These studies included irradiations of sensors with various particle types and energies, including the Co60 gamma-rays. Our previous results obtained for gamma-irradiated diodes and strip sensors indicate a linear increase of bulk current with TID, while the surface current saturates at the lowest TID levels checked (66 Mrad), preventing a determination of the exact TID for which the observed saturation occurs. This work presents the results coming from irradiations by Co60 gamma-rays to multiple low TIDs, ranging from 0.5 to 100 krad. The detailed study of total, bulk, and surface currents of diodes explores an unknown dependence of surface current on the TID, annealing, and temperature. Additionally, the effect of the p-stop implant between the bias and the guard ring of measured samples is shown. The observations are relevant for the initial operations of the new ATLAS tracker.</description>

      <title>Design and performance of the prototype of the new Particle Identification system for the MAGNEX spectrometer within the NUMEN project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MAGNEX large acceptance magnetic spectrometer is installed at the Laboratori Nazionali del Sud of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN-LNS) in Catania. In the past, MAGNEX experimental campaigns were performed using ion beams up to $10^{10}$ pps provided by the Superconducting Cyclotron (SC) accelerator. Nevertheless, in the context of the NUMEN (Nuclear Matrix Elements for Neutrinoless double beta decay) project, which aims to get accurate values of the tiny Double Charge Exchange (DCE) cross-sections for a large number of nuclei of interest for the neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$), the SC is being fully refurbished featuring ion beams with energies from 15 up to 70 MeV/u and intensities up to $10^{13}$ pps. The high rate of incident particles demands a complete upgrade of the MAGNEX detectors, which will consist of a new Particle Identification (PID) system and a new gas tracker detector along with a $\gamma$-calorimeter. The PID system is equipped with a large number (720) of Silicon Carbide-Cesium Iodide (Tallium doped) telescopes. A prototype of the PID wall has been built and studied thanks to an experimental test with an $^{18}$O beam at 275 MeV incident energy performed at INFN-Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, Italy. In this manuscript, the design of the new PID system, the in-beam test experimental set-up, and the prototype's performances are presented.</description>

      <title>Testing Compact, Fused Silica Resonator Based Inertial Sensors in a Gravitational Wave Detector Prototype Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observatories require significant advances in all aspects of their seismic isolation; inertial sensors being a pressing example. Inertial sensors using gram-scale high mechanical Q factor (Q) glass resonators combined with compact interferometric readout are promising alternatives to kilogram-scale conventional inertial sensors. We have produced fused silica resonators suitable for low frequency inertial sensing and demonstrated that Qs of over 150,000 are possible. One resonator we produced was combined with a homodyne quadrature interferometer (HoQI) to read out the test mass displacement to form an inertial sensor. This is the first time a HoQI was used with a high Q resonator. The resulting sensor was tested against other commercial, kilogram scale inertial sensors at the AEI 10\,m Prototype facility. Despite the dynamic range challenges induced by the test mass motion, we can match the excellent noise floors HoQIs have achieved so far with slow-moving or stationary test masses, showing HoQIs as an excellent candidate for the readout of such sensors. We evaluate the setup as an inertial sensor, showing the best performance demonstrated by any gram-scale sensor to date, with comparable sensitivity to the significantly bulkier sensors used in gravitational wave detectors today. These sensors' compact size, self-calibration, and vacuum compatibility make them ideal candidates for the inertial sensing requirements in future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A High-Granularity Proton CT Enhanced by Track Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) provides a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of Relative Stopping Power (RSP) required for proton therapy planning. This research introduces a novel high-granularity pCT architecture that incorporates a silicon pixel tracking system and a calorimetric range telescope, which uniquely integrates range telescope functionality with track discrimination capabilities. The Bortfeld function fitting and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier algorithms are developed and applied for discrimination. In simulation studies, both approaches demonstrate the capability to reduce uncertainty in Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL) determination for individual proton tracks to below 3~mm. The standard imaging protocol (3.2~mGy, $4\times10^{8}$ protons) achieves sub-millimeter spatial resolution ($\sim$0.5 mm) with sub-1\% RSP accuracy. With proton count requirements reduced by track discrimination, an ultra-low-dose protocol (0.16~mGy, $2\times10^{7}$~protons) is proposed with achieved sub-1\% RSP accuracy and $\sim$1.1~mm spatial resolution in simulation. This low-dose performance significantly expands clinical applicability, particularly for pediatric imaging or frequent imaging scenarios. Furthermore, the target 10 MHz proton detection rate suggests potential for real-time image guidance during radiotherapy. By circumventing the need for ultra-precise energy measurements, this design minimizes hardware complexity and provides a scalable foundation for future pCT systems.</description>

      <title>Desynchronization in multilayer p-i-n drift step recovery diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact semiconductor drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs) can have on high-power microwave applications make them a device of interest for future solid-state electronics. However, there is little known about their functionality and degradation under over-voltaging or high average power dissipation conditions that could therefore hinder their continual design and optimization toward better performance. The experiments on a Si seven layer DSRD conducted in the present paper allowed to broaden the understanding of its opening switching performance under over-voltaging conditions. A striking desynchronization was discovered and linked to junction and electro-neutral region damage through experiments and PSpice modelling.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength thermometry without a priori emissivity information: from promise to disillusionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) thermography provides 2D radiance maps of the IR radiation leaving the surfaces of a scene, based on preliminary calibration. Then, to convert radiance maps into temperature maps, we need to know the emissivity of each element of the scene conjugated to each of the detector elements in the camera's focal plane. Compared to the single-band approach, can multispectral thermography help solve the inverse temperature-emissivity separation problem? Multiwavelength thermometry (MWT) is known to be an underdetermined problem having a continuous infinity of solutions. For this reason, and right from the origin of MWT, it appeared necessary to introduce information on emissivity to assess temperature, for example, by means of an analytical model. Overlooking these recommendations, a number of papers appeared in the early 2000s exploring the idea that we could do without any a priori knowledge of emissivity. Growth became exponential from 2020 onward, with the allegedly successful application of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other novel optimization methods. The aim of the present work is to recall the consequences of MWT as an underdetermined inverse problem, to highlight the errors made by ignoring them, and to bring us back to harsh reality: we must introduce information on emissivity in order to evaluate temperature accurately. Furthermore, this information has to be fully consistent with the true spectral emissivity. To this end, we propose a new method for optimal selection of the emissivity model. A series of blind tests was set up to benchmark different inversion algorithms. The results confirm the failure of the temperature-emissivity separation when no emissivity information is available, despite the multiwavelength approach, which in any case comes as no surprise.</description>
