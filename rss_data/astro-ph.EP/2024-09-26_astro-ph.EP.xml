      <title>Spatially correlated stellar accretion in the Lupus star forming region: Evidence for ongoing infall from the interstellar medium?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material is a potential way to further test this finding.</description>

      <title>Disk2Planet: A Robust and Automated Machine Learning Tool for Parameter Inference in Disk-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Disk2Planet, a machine learning-based tool to infer key parameters in disk-planet systems from observed protoplanetary disk structures. Disk2Planet takes as input the disk structures in the form of two-dimensional density and velocity maps, and outputs disk and planet properties, that is, the Shakura--Sunyaev viscosity, the disk aspect ratio, the planet--star mass ratio, and the planet's radius and azimuth. We integrate the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA--ES), an evolutionary algorithm tailored for complex optimization problems, and the Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network (PPDONet), a neural network designed to predict solutions of disk--planet interactions. Our tool is fully automated and can retrieve parameters in one system in three minutes on an Nvidia A100 graphics processing unit. We empirically demonstrate that our tool achieves percent-level or higher accuracy, and is able to handle missing data and unknown levels of noise.</description>

      <title>Most Super-Earths Have Less Than 3% Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Earths are highly irradiated, small planets with bulk densities approximately consistent with Earth. We construct combined interior-atmosphere models of super-Earths that trace the partitioning of water throughout a planet, including an iron-rich core, silicate-rich mantle, and steam atmosphere. We compare these models with exoplanet observations to infer a $1\sigma$ upper limit on total water mass fraction of $\lesssim 3\%$ at the population level. We consider end-member scenarios that may change this value, including the efficiency of mantle outgassing and escape of high mean-molecular weight atmospheres. Although our constraints are agnostic as to the origin of water, we show that our upper limits are consistent with its production via chemical reactions of primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with magma oceans. This mechanism has also been hypothesised to explain Earth's water content, possibly pointing to a unified channel for the origins of water on small terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>TOI-2458 b: A mini-Neptune consistent with in situ hot Jupiter formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of TOI-2458 b, a transiting mini-Neptune around an F-type star leaving the main-sequence with a mass of $M_\star=1.05 \pm 0.03$ M$_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=1.31 \pm 0.03$ R$_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6005\pm50$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.10\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the HARPS spectrograph, we found that the transiting planet has an orbital period of $\sim$3.74 days, a mass of $M_p=13.31\pm0.99$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_p=2.83\pm0.20$ R$_{\oplus}$. The host star TOI-2458 shows a short activity cycle of $\sim$54 days revealed in the HARPS S-index time series. We took the opportunity to investigate other F stars showing activity cycle periods comparable to that of TOI-2458 and found that they have shorter rotation periods than would be expected based on the gyrochronology predictions. In addition, we determined TOI-2458's stellar inclination angle to be $i_\star\,=\,10.6_{-10.6}^{+13.3}$ degrees. We discuss that both phenomena (fast stellar rotation and planet orbit inclination) could be explained by in situ formation of a hot Jupiter interior to TOI-2458 b. It is plausible that this hot Jupiter was recently engulfed by the star. Analysis of HARPS spectra has identified the presence of another planet with a period of $P\,=\,16.55\pm0.06$ days and a minimum mass of $M_p \sin i=10.22\pm1.90$ M$_{\oplus}$.</description>

      <title>A closer look at individual collisions of dust aggregates: Material mixing and exchange on microscopic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisions between aggregates with different histories and compositions are expected to be commonplace in dynamically active protoplanetary discs. Nonetheless, relatively little is known about how collisions themselves may contribute to the resulting mixing of material. Here we use state-of-the-art granular dynamics simulations to investigate mixing between target/projectile material in a variety of individual aggregate-aggregate collisions, and use the results to discuss the efficiency of collisional mixing in protoplanetary environments. We consider sticking collisions (up to 10-20 m/s for our set-up) and disruptive collisions (40 m/s) of BPCA and BCCA clusters, and quantify mixing in the resulting fragments on both individual fragment and sub-aggregate levels. We find that the mass fraction of material that can be considered to be `well-mixed' (i.e., locally made up of a mix of target and projectile material) to be limited, typically between 3-6% for compact BPCA precursors, and increasing to 20-30% for more porous BCCA clusters. The larger fragments produced in disruptive collisions are equally heterogeneous, suggesting aggregate-aggregate collisions are a relatively inefficient way of mixing material with different origins on small scales.</description>

      <title>TOI-5005 b: A super-Neptune in the savanna near the ridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neptunian desert and savanna have been recently found to be separated by a ridge, an overdensity of planets in the $\simeq$3-5 days period range. These features are thought to be shaped by dynamical and atmospheric processes. However, their relative roles are not yet well understood. We intend to confirm and characterise the super-Neptune TESS candidate TOI-5005.01, which orbits a moderately bright (V = 11.8) solar-type star (G2 V) with an orbital period of 6.3 days. We confirm TOI-5005 b to be a transiting super-Neptune with a radius of $R_{\rm p}$ = $6.25\pm 0.24$ $\rm R_{\rm \oplus}$ ($R_{\rm p}$ = $0.558\pm 0.021$ $\rm R_{\rm J}$) and a mass of $M_{\rm p}$ = $32.7\pm 5.9$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$ ($M_{\rm p}$ = $0.103\pm 0.018$ $\rm M_{\rm J}$), which corresponds to a mean density of $\rho_{\rm p}$ = $0.74 \pm 0.16$ $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$. Our internal structure modelling indicates that the overall metal mass fraction is well constrained to a value slightly lower than that of Neptune and Uranus ($Z_{\rm planet}$ = $0.76^{+0.04}_{-0.11}$). We also estimated the present-day atmospheric mass-loss rate of TOI-5005 b but found contrasting predictions depending on the choice of photoevaporation model. At a population level, we find statistical evidence ($p$-value = $0.0092^{+0.0184}_{-0.0066}$) that planets in the savanna such as TOI-5005 b tend to show lower densities than planets in the ridge, with a dividing line around 1 $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$, which supports the hypothesis of different evolutionary pathways populating both regimes. TOI-5005 b is located in a key region of the period-radius space to study the transition between the Neptunian ridge and the savanna. It orbits the brightest star of all such planets, which makes it a target of interest for atmospheric and orbital architecture observations that will bring a clearer picture of its overall evolution.</description>

      <title>MODEL&amp;CO: Exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging by learning across multiple observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is particularly challenging due to the high contrast between the planet and the star luminosities, and their small angular separation. In addition to tailored instrumental facilities implementing adaptive optics and coronagraphy, post-processing methods combining several images recorded in pupil tracking mode are needed to attenuate the nuisances corrupting the signals of interest. Most of these post-processing methods build a model of the nuisances from the target observations themselves, resulting in strongly limited detection sensitivity at short angular separations due to the lack of angular diversity. To address this issue, we propose to build the nuisance model from an archive of multiple observations by leveraging supervised deep learning techniques. The proposed approach casts the detection problem as a reconstruction task and captures the structure of the nuisance from two complementary representations of the data. Unlike methods inspired by reference differential imaging, the proposed model is highly non-linear and does not resort to explicit image-to-image similarity measurements and subtractions. The proposed approach also encompasses statistical modeling of learnable spatial features. The latter is beneficial to improve both the detection sensitivity and the robustness against heterogeneous data. We apply the proposed algorithm to several datasets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, and demonstrate a superior precision-recall trade-off compared to the PACO algorithm. Interestingly, the gain is especially important when the diversity induced by ADI is the most limited, thus supporting the ability of the proposed approach to learn information across multiple observations.</description>

      <title>Analytical models for secular descents in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triple body systems are prevalent in nature, from planetary to stellar to supermassive black hole scales. In a hierarchical triple system, oscillations of the inner orbit's eccentricity and inclination can be induced on secular timescales. Over many cycles, the octupole-level terms in the secular equations of motion can drive the system to extremely high eccentricities via the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. The overall decrease in the inner orbit's pericenter distance has potentially dramatic effects for realistic systems, such as tidal disruption events. We present an analytical approximation in the test particle limit to describe individual step-wise increases in eccentricity of the inner orbit. A second approximation, also in the test particle limit, is obtained by integrating the equations of motion and calibrating to numerical simulations to estimate the overall octupole-level time evolution of the eccentricity. The latter approach is then extended beyond the test particle to the general case. The three novel analytical approximations are compared to numerical solutions to show that the models accurately describe the form and timescale of the secular descent from large distances to a close-encounter distance (e.g., the Roche limit). By circumventing the need for numerical simulations to obtain the long-term behavior, these approximations can be used to readily estimate properties of close encounters and descent timescales for populations of systems. We demonstrate by calculating rates of EKL-driven migration for Hot Jupiters in stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Giant Impact Simulations with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraining planet formation models based on the observed exoplanet population requires generating large samples of synthetic planetary systems, which can be computationally prohibitive. A significant bottleneck is simulating the giant impact phase, during which planetary embryos evolve gravitationally and combine to form planets, which may themselves experience later collisions. To accelerate giant impact simulations, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predicting collisional outcomes in multiplanet systems. Trained on more than 500,000 $N$-body simulations of three-planet systems, we develop an ML model that can accurately predict which two planets will experience a collision, along with the state of the post-collision planets, from a short integration of the system's initial conditions. Our model greatly improves on non-ML baselines that rely on metrics from dynamics theory, which struggle to accurately predict which pair of planets will experience a collision. By combining with a model for predicting long-term stability, we create an ML-based giant impact emulator, which can predict the outcomes of giant impact simulations with reasonable accuracy and a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude. We expect our model to enable analyses that would not otherwise be computationally feasible. As such, we release our training code, along with an easy-to-use API for our collision outcome model and giant impact emulator.</description>

      <title>The JWST/NIRISS Deep Spectroscopic Survey for Young Brown Dwarfs and Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>How external photo-evaporation changes the chemical composition of the inner disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars mostly form in clusters where neighboring stars can influence proto-planetary disc evolution. Besides gravitational interactions, external photoevaporation can shape these discs. Depending on the strength of photoevaporation, discs can be destroyed within 1-2 Myrs or more gradually. We use the chemcomp code, incorporating a viscous disc evolution model with pebble drift and evaporation, to calculate the chemical composition of protoplanetary discs. This code is extended to include external photoevaporation based on the FRIED grid. Initially, the disc evolves purely viscously, with the inner disc's C/O ratio decreasing due to inward drifting and evaporating water ice pebbles. Over time, the C/O ratio increases as water vapor accretes onto the star and carbon-rich gas migrates inward. Once external photoevaporation starts, the outer disc disperses, but the inner disc's chemical evolution follows that of a purely viscous disc, as most pebbles have already drifted inward within 1 Myr. At low viscosity, the inner disc's C/O ratio remains sub-solar until dispersion by photoevaporation. At high viscosity, the C/O ratio can reach super-solar values, due to faster accretion of water vapor and inward migration of carbon-rich gas, provided the disc survives a few Myrs. In both cases, there is no significant difference in the inner disc's chemical composition compared to a purely viscous model due to the rapid inward drift of pebbles. Our model predicts that inner disc chemistry should be similar for discs subject to external photoevaporation and isolated discs, consistent with JWST observations.</description>
