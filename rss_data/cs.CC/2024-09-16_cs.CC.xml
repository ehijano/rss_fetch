      <title>Journalists, Emotions, and the Introduction of Generative AI Chatbots: A Large-Scale Analysis of Tweets Before and After the Launch of ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of a broader look at the impact of generative AI, this study investigated the emotional responses of journalists to the release of ChatGPT at the time of its launch. By analyzing nearly 1 million Tweets from journalists at major U.S. news outlets, we tracked changes in emotional tone and sentiment before and after the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. Using various computational and natural language processing techniques to measure emotional shifts in response to ChatGPT's release, we found an increase in positive emotion and a more favorable tone post-launch, suggesting initial optimism toward AI's potential. This research underscores the pivotal role of journalists as interpreters of technological innovation and disruption, highlighting how their emotional reactions may shape public narratives around emerging technologies. The study contributes to understanding the intersection of journalism, emotion, and AI, offering insights into the broader societal impact of generative AI tools.</description>

      <title>Undecidability and incompleteness in quantum information theory and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey a number of incompleteness results in operator algebras stemming from the recent undecidability result in quantum complexity theory known as $\operatorname{MIP}^*=\operatorname{RE}$, the most prominent of which is the G\"odelian refutation of the Connes Embedding Problem. We also discuss the very recent use of $\operatorname{MIP}^*=\operatorname{RE}$ in refuting the Aldous-Lyons conjecture in probability theory.</description>

      <title>Rice-like complexity lower bounds for Boolean and uniform automata networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automata networks are a versatile model of finite discrete dynamical systems composed of interacting entities (the automata), able to embed any directed graph as a dynamics on its space of configurations (the set of vertices, representing all the assignments of a state to each entity). In this world, virtually any question is decidable by a simple exhaustive search. We lever the Rice-like complexity lower bound, stating that any non-trivial monadic second order logic question on the graph of its dynamics is NP-hard or coNP-hard (given the automata network description), to bounded alphabets (including the Boolean case). This restriction is particularly meaningful for applications to "complex systems", where each entity has a restricted set of possible states (its alphabet). For the non-deterministic case, trivial questions are solvable in constant time, hence there is a sharp gap in complexity for the algorithmic solving of concrete problems on them. For the non-deterministic case, non-triviality is defined at bounded treewidth, which offers a structure to establish metatheorems of complexity lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Vertex identification to a forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a graph class and $k\in\mathbb{N}$. We say a graph $G$ admits a \emph{$k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$} if there is a partition $\mathcal{P}$ of some set $X\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that after identifying each part in $\mathcal{P}$ to a single vertex, the resulting graph belongs to $\mathcal{H}$. The graph parameter ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}$ is defined so that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ admits a $k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$, and the problem of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$} asks, given a graph $G$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, whether ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k$. If we set $\mathcal{H}$ to be the class $\mathcal{F}$ of acyclic graphs, we generate the problem \textsc{Identification to Forest}, which we show to be {\sf NP}-complete. We prove that, when parameterized by the size $k$ of the identification set, it admits a kernel of size $2k+1$. For our kernel we reveal a close relation of \textsc{Identification to Forest} with the \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. We also study the combinatorics of the \textsf{yes}-instances of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$}, i.e., the class $\mathcal{H}^{(k)}:=\{G\mid {\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k\}$, {which we show to be minor-closed for every $k$} when $\mathcal{H}$ is minor-closed. We prove that the minor-obstructions of $\mathcal{F}^{(k)}$ are of size at most $2k+4$. We also prove that every graph $G$ such that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{F}}(G)$ is sufficiently big contains as a minor either a cycle on $k$ vertices, or $k$ disjoint triangles, or the \emph{$k$-marguerite} graph, that is the graph obtained by $k$ disjoint triangles by identifying one vertex of each of them into the same vertex.</description>

      <title>Approximately counting maximal independent set is equivalent to #SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. It is also the key problem of mathematics, computer science, and other fields. A counting problem is a type of computational problem that associated with the number of solutions. Besides, counting problems help us better understand several fields such as algorithm analysis, complexity theory, artificial intelligence, etc. The problem of counting maximal independent sets is #P-complete. So it is natural to think about approximate counting for maximal independent sets problem. In this article, we study the complexity of approximately counting maximal independent sets. Specifically, we are the first to prove that the #MIS problem is AP-interreducible with the #SAT of a given general graph.</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness Results of the Cardinality-Based Minimum s-t Cut Problem in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hypergraphs an edge that crosses a cut can be split in several ways, depending on how many nodes are placed on each side of the cut. A cardinality-based splitting function assigns a nonnegative cost of $w_i$ for each cut hyperedge $e$ with exactly $i$ nodes on the side of the cut that contains the minority of nodes from $e$. The cardinality-based minimum $s$-$t$ cut aims to find an $s$-$t$ cut with minimum total cost. Assuming the costs $w_i$ are polynomially bounded by the input size and $w_0=0$ and $w_1=1$, we show that the problem becomes NP-hard outside the submodular region found by Veldt et al. Our result also holds for $k$-uniform hypergraphs with $k \geq 4$. Specifically for $4$-uniform hypergraphs we show that the problem is NP-hard for all $w_2&gt;2$, and additionally prove that the \textsc{No-Even-Split} problem is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Maximum $k$- vs. $\ell$-colourings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00440v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present polynomial-time SDP-based algorithms for the following problem: For fixed $k \leq \ell$, given a real number $\epsilon&gt;0$ and a graph $G$ that admits a $k$-colouring with a $\rho$-fraction of the edges coloured properly, it returns an $\ell$-colouring of $G$ with an $(\alpha \rho - \epsilon)$-fraction of the edges coloured properly in polynomial time in $G$ and $1 / \epsilon$. Our algorithms are based on the algorithms of Frieze and Jerrum [Algorithmica'97] and of Karger, Motwani and Sudan [JACM'98].
  When $k$ is fixed and $\ell$ grows large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - o(1 / \ell)$. When $k, \ell$ are both large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell) - O(1 / k^2)$; if we fix $d = \ell - k$ and allow $k, \ell$ to grow large, this is $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$.
  By extending the results of Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O'Donnell [SICOMP'07] to the promise setting, we show that for large $k$ and $\ell$, assuming Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (\UGC), it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio $\alpha$ greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided that $\ell$ is bounded by a function that is $o(\exp(\sqrt[3]{k}))$. For the case where $d = \ell - k$ is fixed, this bound matches the performance of our algorithm up to $o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$. Furthermore, by extending the results of Guruswami and Sinop [ToC'13] to the promise setting, we prove that it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 8 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided again that $\ell$ is bounded as before (but this time without assuming the \UGC).</description>
