      <title>ALMGuard: Safety Shortcuts and Where to Find Them as Guardrails for Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard, the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM), which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new state of the art. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WeifeiJin/ALMGuard.</description>

      <title>SP-MCQA: Evaluating Intelligibility of TTS Beyond the Word Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy, exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility. SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.</description>

      <title>Modeling strategies for speech enhancement in the latent space of a neural audio codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) provide compact latent speech representations in the form of sequences of continuous vectors or discrete tokens. In this work, we investigate how these two types of speech representations compare when used as training targets for supervised speech enhancement. We consider both autoregressive and non-autoregressive speech enhancement models based on the Conformer architecture, as well as a simple baseline where the NAC encoder is simply fine-tuned for speech enhancement. Our experiments reveal three key findings: predicting continuous latent representations consistently outperforms discrete token prediction; autoregressive models achieve higher quality but at the expense of intelligibility and efficiency, making non-autoregressive models more attractive in practice; and encoder fine-tuning yields the strongest enhancement metrics overall, though at the cost of degraded codec reconstruction. The code and audio samples are available online.</description>

      <title>UniTok-Audio: A Unified Audio Generation Framework via Generative Modeling on Discrete Codec Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling has recently achieved remarkable success across text, image, and audio domains, demonstrating powerful capabilities for unified representation learning. However, audio generation models still face challenges in terms of audio quality and generalization ability across tasks. This fragmentation results in redundant development efforts, inconsistent performance, and limited extensibility. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{UniTok-Audio}, a scalable and extensible framework for unified audio generation tasks. Specifically, 1) UniTok-Audio extracts continuous feature of conditions to generates discrete tokens of target audio in an autoregressive manner; 2) a special task identifier token unifies different learning patterns of multiple tasks in a single framework; 3) a dual-stream audio codec involving acoustic and semantic branch is developed for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that UniTok-Audio achieves competitive performance in comparation with state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five time-aligned tasks: speech restoration, target speaker extraction, speech separation, voice conversion, and language-queried audio source separation. To foster future research, we will open-source our codebase. The demo page of our work can be found here: https://alibaba.github.io/unified-audio.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Features in Audio Latent Spaces via Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process, revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer) audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.</description>

      <title>ARECHO: Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-Based Hypothesis Optimization for Speech Multi-Metric Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech signal analysis poses significant challenges, particularly in tasks such as speech quality evaluation and profiling, where the goal is to predict multiple perceptual and objective metrics. For instance, metrics like PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality), STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility), and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) each capture different aspects of speech quality. However, these metrics often have different scales, assumptions, and dependencies, making joint estimation non-trivial. To address these issues, we introduce ARECHO (Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-based Hypothesis Optimization), a chain-based, versatile evaluation system for speech assessment grounded in autoregressive dependency modeling. ARECHO is distinguished by three key innovations: (1) a comprehensive speech information tokenization pipeline; (2) a dynamic classifier chain that explicitly captures inter-metric dependencies; and (3) a two-step confidence-oriented decoding algorithm that enhances inference reliability. Experiments demonstrate that ARECHO significantly outperforms the baseline framework across diverse evaluation scenarios, including enhanced speech analysis, speech generation evaluation, and, noisy speech evaluation. Furthermore, its dynamic dependency modeling improves interpretability by capturing inter-metric relationships. Across tasks, ARECHO offers reference-free evaluation using its dynamic classifier chain to support subset queries (single or multiple metrics) and reduces error propagation via confidence-oriented decoding.</description>

      <title>Audio Signal Processing Using Time Domain Mel-Frequency Wavelet Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</description>

      <title>Phoenix-VAD: Streaming Semantic Endpoint Detection for Full-Duplex Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet they lack a plug-and-play full-duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix-VAD, an LLM-based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix-VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix-VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full-duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next-generation human-computer interaction.</description>
