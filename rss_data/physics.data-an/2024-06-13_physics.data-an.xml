      <title>On the archetypal `flavours', indices and teleconnections of ENSO revealed by global sea surface temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation global (ENSO) imprint on sea surface temperature comes in many guises. To identify its tropical fingerprints and impacts on the rest of the climate system, we propose a global approach based on archetypal analysis (AA), a pattern recognition method based on the identification of extreme configurations in the dataset under investigation. Relying on detrended sea surface temperature monthly anomalies over the 1982 to 2022 period, the technique recovers central and eastern Pacific ENSO types identified by more traditional methods and allows one to hierarchically add extra flavours and nuances to both persistent and transient phases of the phenomenon. Archetypal patterns found compare favorably to phase identification from K-means, fuzzy C-means and recently published network-based machine-learning algorithms. The AA implementation is modified for the identification of ENSO phases in sub-seasonal-to-seasonal prediction systems and complements current alert systems in characterising the diversity of ENSO and its teleconnections. Tropical and extra-tropical teleconnection composites from various oceanic and atmospheric fields derived from the analysis are shown to be robust and physically relevant. Extending AA to sub-surface ocean fields improves the discrimination between phases when the characterisation of ENSO based on sea surface temperature is uncertain. We show that AA on detrended sea-level monthly anomalies provides a clearer expression of ENSO types.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Machine Learning Model Comparison for Cherenkov and Scintillation Light Separation due to Particle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for novel detector mediums such as Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) has increased over the last few decades due to their capability for both low energy particle interactions and higher light yield. Recently, the usage of machine learning (ML) methods in high-energy physics has also been increasing. The ML and AI methods are used in many physics projects in the field since they provide effective and sensitive results. In this study, we aimed to develop a comprehensive analysis of water Cherenkov detectors and perform physics analyses to efficiently separate Cherenkov and scintillation photons with ML algorithms using the data from the WbLS detector environment. The main goal of this study was to produce more precise solutions to physics problems, such as signal classification, by applying ML techniques to the simulation and experimental data. Here, we trained more than 20 ML models, and our results revealed that three machine learning models, XGBoost, Light GBM, and Random Forest models, and their ensemble model gave us more than 95\% accuracy for separating Cherenkov and scintillation photons with balanced and unbalanced datasets. This is a significant increase in efficiency as compared with the results of the classical method by applying simple time cuts.</description>

      <title>When Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived - somewhat naively - as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands.
  Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics - that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases - with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests.
  Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by a class of weighted linear statistics.</description>

      <title>Binary asteroid candidates in Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroids with companions constitute an excellent sample for studying the collisional and dynamical evolution of minor planets. The currently known binary population were discovered by different complementary techniques that produce, for the moment, a strongly biased distribution, especially in a range of intermediate asteroid sizes (approximately 20 to 100 km) where both mutual photometric events and high-resolution adaptive optic imaging are poorly efficient. A totally independent technique of binary asteroid discovery, based on astrometry, can help to reveal new binary systems and populate a range of sizes and separations that remain nearly unexplored. In this work, we describe a dedicated period detection method and its results for the Gaia DR3 data set. This method looks for the presence of a periodic signature in the orbit post-fit residuals. After conservative filtering and validation based on statistical and physical criteria, we are able to present a first sample of astrometric binary candidates, to be confirmed by other observation techniques such as photometric light curves and stellar occultations.</description>
