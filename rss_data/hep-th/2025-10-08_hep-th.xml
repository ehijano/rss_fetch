      <title>Asymptotically Flat Rotating Topological Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new class of smooth, horizonless, non-supersymmetric solutions in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, which we call rotating topological stars. Built from a Kerr-Taub-bolt geometry embedded in five dimensions, they constitute the first rotating generalization of the topological star compatible with both smoothness in the interior and standard Kaluza-Klein asymptotics, S$^1\times\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$. The solutions carry angular momentum, magnetic and electric charges, and form a discrete tower of states labeled by a primary quantum number controlling the spin. Remarkably, despite lying outside the black-hole extremality bound, they can approach arbitrarily closely (in conserved charges) the Kerr black string with a large boost along the fifth dimension, making them relevant prototypes for rotating and astrophysical black-hole microstates. We analyze their geometry in detail, including their gravitational multipoles that can significantly deviate from those of black holes and the presence of an ergoregion, and show that both geodesics and scalar perturbations separate, paving the way for analyzing their dynamics in future work.</description>

      <title>Positive Spin-induced Quadrupole Moment in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify singularity-free Running-Kerr-Taub-Bolt solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity that descend to four-dimensional rotating solutions with flat-space asymptotics. We compute their spin-induced quadrupole moment and find that for a certain range of charges this quadrupole moment is positive. This behavior differs from the Kerr black hole and from most other spinning objects constructed with ``normal'' four-dimensional matter, and we discuss the top-down physics of these solutions that could be responsible for this unusual behavior.</description>

      <title>Generating Function of Single Centered Black Hole Index from the Igusa Cusp Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce manifestly duality invariant generating function of the index of single centered black holes in the heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus. This function is obtained by subtracting, from the inverse of the Igusa cusp form, the generating function of the index of two centered black holes constructed from the Dedekind eta function. We also study the analytic properties of this function in the Siegel upper half plane.</description>

      <title>Witten Effect in $3$-Form Description of $\theta$-vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\theta$-vacua of a gauge theory admit an equivalent formulation as vacua of a massless Chern-Simons $3$-form, which originate from the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. This formulation provides a framework in which the physical manifestations of the $\theta$-angle, which are quantum in origin, can be captured at the level of effective classical equations of motion. Within this framework, we derive the Witten effect, demonstrating that in the background of a massless $3$-form, the magnetic monopole indeed acquires an electric charge proportional to $\theta$. This result, in particular, provides evidence that instantons, even when constrained by the Higgs effect, maintain a non-zero topological susceptibility of the vacuum. In addition to the Witten effect, we numerically demonstrate that a magnetic monopole exhibits polarizability when placed in a constant background electric field.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Complexity in Dyonic Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and holographic complexity (HC) for three-dimensional dyonic quantum black holes, incorporating corrections arising from bulk quantum fields in the setup of double holography. We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy through the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) prescription and the island prescription. Using RT extremization, we evaluate HEE for connected and disconnected (island) surfaces and show islands emerge when RT surfaces intersect the brane; entanglement entropy grows with subregion size and ultimately saturates for quantum black holes as well as dressed defects. For complexity, we analyze both CV (perturbative) and CA (exact, all-orders) prescriptions: the leading quantum corrections feature universal behavior and the late-time growth can be expressed in thermodynamic variables, obeying generalized Lloyd-type bounds. In contrast, quantum dressed defects exhibit vanishing late-time growth. The CA prescription proves to be more tractable nonperturbatively and yields a thermodynamic interpretation of complexity growth.</description>

      <title>Compactification Without Orientation, or a Topological Scenario for CP Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In higher dimensional theories, we often assume that the extra dimensions form an orientable space, perhaps with singularities. However, many physical theories are well-defined on non-orientable spaces, and many spaces are not orientable, so it is reasonable to explore what happens if the assumption of orientability is relaxed. Here we consider the simplest example of free 6D theories compactified on a flat Klein bottle. We focus on a Dirac fermion in 6D, with boundary conditions that define ${\rm pin}^+$ and ${\rm pin}^-$ structures. Translation invariance is broken by the boundary conditions, which leads to sharp features localized near the parity walls (fixed points of the reflection used to construct the Klein bottle). For a scalar field, there is a position-dependent energy density, peaked near the parity walls. A Dirac fermion can lead to breaking of parity, charge conjugation and CP in 3+1 dimensions. Order parameters for this breaking are provided by the vevs of certain fermion bilinears, again peaked near the parity walls. As one potential application, these results suggest mechanisms for CP violation and baryogenesis, enabled by compactification on a Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>Classicized dynamics and initial conditions in field theories with fakeons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories with purely virtual particles (fakeons) do not possess a classical action in the strict sense, but rather a "classicized" one, obtained by integrating out the fake particles at tree level. Although this procedure generates nonlocal interactions, we show that the resulting classicized equations of motion are not burdened with the need to specify infinitely many initial conditions. The reason is the inherent link between the fakeonic system and the parent higher-derivative local system: the solution space of the former is an appropriate subspace of solutions of the latter. A somewhat unexpected proviso is that, in order to avoid overcounting, the fakeon prescription must be obtained as a limit or special case of a more generic prescription. Ultimately, the number of degrees of freedom matches physical expectations, the extra ones (ghosts or otherwise) being removed by rendering them purely virtual. We illustrate the counting in simple linear solvable models and provide the general proof. Along similar lines, we analyze Dirac's removal of runaway solutions in classical electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Resonance with quasinormal modes in long-range kinks' collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a rational scalar field model in (1+1)-dimensions where the long-range character of the kinks is controllable. We show via numerical simulations that kinks with long-range tails on both sides can exhibit resonance windows. The resonant energy exchange mechanism occurs via the excitation of quasinormal modes, which we obtain via a spectral analysis. Additionally, we locate a resonance window in a family of $\phi^{10}$ models with long-range tails on both sides. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm for initializing long-range kink collisions, based on convection-diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions and criticality for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gravitational thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be extended by allowing for variations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant. In the dual CFT this corresponds to including the central charge C and its chemical potential $\mu$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables. In addition, compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we consider the critical behavior and phase transition phenomena of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. We find that the conventional description of free energy cannot adequately describe the phase transitions and critical behavior of the CFT in this ensemble. Perhaps a new understanding and description should be introduced.</description>

      <title>Relevant Deformations, Brane Brick Models and Triality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of relevant deformations connecting 2d (0,2) gauge theories on D1-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds beyond pure mass deformations. The underlying geometry provides powerful insights when field-theoretic tools are still lacking. We observe that the volume of the Sasaki-Einstein base of the Calabi-Yau 4-fold grows towards the IR, signaling the relevance of deformations. We exploit the map between gauge theory fields and GLSM fields to compute scaling dimensions directly from divisor volumes, allowing for a sharper determination of whether terms in the Lagrangian are relevant or irrelevant. Moreover, this map provides a systematic way to determine the precise set of terms needed to realize a given deformation. We also explore the interplay between general relevant deformations and triality, studying cases where non-mass deformations are mapped to mass deformations in a dual theory, and resolving puzzles that seem to require non-holomorphic couplings in one of the dual phases. Finally, we present evidence that when the Hilbert series of the mesonic moduli space is refined only under the U(1) R-symmetry, it becomes invariant even under non-mass relevant deformations of the brane brick models corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds related by a birational transformation, extending previous results to a broader class of deformations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Spacetime with Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a novel application of the tools of topological data analysis (TDA) to nonperturbative quantum gravity, we introduce a new class of observables that allows us to assess whether quantum spacetime really resembles a ``quantum foam" near the Planck scale. The key idea is to investigate the Betti numbers of coarse-grained path integral histories, regularized in terms of dynamical triangulations, as a function of the coarse-graining scale. In two dimensions our analysis exhibits the well-known fractal structure of Euclidean quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology to characterize properties of quantum spacetime in a strongly quantum-fluctuating regime, using tools from topological data analysis. Starting from a microscopic quantum geometry, generated nonperturbatively in terms of dynamical triangulations (DT), we compute the Betti numbers of a sequence of coarse-grained versions of the geometry as a function of the coarse-graining scale, yielding a characteristic ``topological finger print". We successfully implement this methodology in Lorentzian and Euclidean 2D quantum gravity, defined via lattice quantum gravity based on causal and Euclidean DT, yielding different results. Effective topology also enables us to formulate necessary conditions for the recovery of spacetime symmetries in a classical limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic Thermodynamics of Higher-Dimensional AdS Black Holes with CFT Rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamic behavior of charged AdS black holes in higher-dimensional spacetimes within the framework of conformal holographic extended thermodynamics. This formalism is based on a novel AdS/CFT dictionary in which the conformal rescaling factor of the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) is treated as a thermodynamic parameter, while Newton's constant is held fixed and the AdS radius is allowed to vary. We explore how variations in the CFT state, represented by its central charge, influence the bulk thermodynamics, phase structure, and stability of black holes in five and six dimensions. Our analysis reveals the emergence of Van der Waals like phase transitions and critical phenomena governed by the central charge. Additionally, we find that the thermodynamic behavior of AdS black holes is affected by the dimensionality of the bulk spacetime, as we compare higher-dimensional black holes to lower-dimensional ones, such as BTZ black holes. These findings provide new insights into the role of boundary degrees of freedom in shaping the thermodynamics of gravitational systems via holography.</description>

Abstract: Using the recent six loop renormalization group functions for Lee-Yang and percolation theory constructed by Schnetz from a scalar cubic Lagrangian, we deduce the $\epsilon$ expansion of the critical exponents for both cases. Estimates for the exponents in three, four and five dimensions are extracted using two-sided Pad\'{e} approximants and shown to be compatible with values from other approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify raising and lowering operators of the de Sitter algebra with focus on their action on states in particular in 4 spacetime dimensions. There isn't a unique solution to the question of how the de Sitter ladder operators act on states. By fixing the action of certain generators one can conclude on the action of the rest. Our main aim is to be able to identify highest and lowest weight states such that we can recognize them for quantized fields on a rigid de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Hayden--Preskill Model via Local Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the Hayden--Preskill (HP) information recovery protocol in 2d CFTs via local joining quenches. Euclidean path integrals with slits prepare the HP subsystems: the message $M$, its reference $N$, the Page-time black hole $B$, the early radiation $E$, and the late radiation $R$; the remaining black hole after emitting $R$ is denoted as $B'$. The single-slit geometry provides an analytically tractable toy model, while the bounded-slit geometry more closely captures the HP setup. In the free Dirac fermion 2d CFT, the mutual information $I(N\!:\!B')$ shows quasi-particle dynamics with partial or full revivals, whereas that in holographic 2d CFTs, which are expected to be maximally chaotic, exhibit sharp transitions: in the bounded-slit case, when the size of the late radiation becomes comparable to that of the reference $N$, $I(N\!:\!B')$ does vanish at late time, otherwise it remains finite. This contrast between free CFTs and holographic CFTs gives a clear characterization of the HP recovery threshold.</description>

Abstract: We investigate tricritical phase transitions in a holographic model of topological superconductivity using Einstein-Maxwell gravity coupled with a charged scalar field in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. By incorporating both gravitational backreaction and quartic self-interaction $V(\phi) = \lambda \phi^4$, we demonstrate that the system exhibits both second-order and first-order phase transitions separated by a tricritical point at $(q_{\mathrm{tri}},T_{\mathrm{tri}})=(2.00\pm0.02,0.1521\pm0.0003)$ in the $(q,T)$ parameter space, where $q$ is the dimensionless charge parameter. The backreacted critical temperature shows enhancement by a factor of 1.22 compared to the probe limit, revealing the importance of strong coupling effects. Tricritical scaling analysis yields an exponent $\phi=0.40\pm0.03$, deviating significantly from mean-field predictions ($\phi=2/3$) due to finite-size effects and holographic geometric corrections. The order parameter critical exponent $\beta=0.50\pm0.02$ remains consistent with mean-field theory due to large-$N$ suppression of quantum fluctuations. The frequency-dependent conductivity exhibits a superconducting gap with energy ratio $\omega_{g}/T_{c}=3.18\pm0.05$, representing a $10\%$ deviation from BCS theory. Holographic entanglement entropy provides quantum information signatures that clearly distinguish transition types. Our results establish that gravitational backreaction, combined with scalar self-interaction, is essential for generating tricritical behavior in holographic superconductors.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically Quantum Effects of Axion Dark Matter are Undetectable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is the usual treatment of axion dark matter as a classical field reliable? We show that the answer is subtle: the axion field could well be in a quantum state that has no complete classical description, but realistic detectors cannot tell the difference. To see this, we solve a fully quantum model of axion detection using quantum optics techniques. We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling. Our work exemplifies that there should always be a classical analog for axion dark matter effects, extends to other wave (ultralight) dark-matter candidates, and gives a general method to compute the effects of exotic dark-matter states.</description>

Abstract: Normal particles carry a microscopic arrow of causality. Lee-Wick ghosts carry the reversed arrow, mediating characteristic collider signals in flat space: opposite-sign scattering amplitudes that violate positivity bounds; acausality on time scales set by their negative decay rate. During inflation, the corresponding cosmo-collider ghost signals are: opposite-sign non-Gaussianities; Boltzmann-unsuppressed local oscillatory signals without their non-local counterparts; IR-enhanced bi-spectrum and power spectrum, depending on the dimension of the interaction operator, which decreases if the ghost decay rate is comparable to the Hubble rate.</description>

      <title>Approximate Gaussianity Beyond Initialisation in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still highly-interpretable, models can be developed.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality in two-dimensional correlated topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a boundary enriches the nature of quantum phase transitions. However, the boundary critical phenomena in topological superconductors remain underexplored so far. Here, we investigate the boundary criticality in a two-dimensional correlated time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor tuned through a quantum phase transition into a trivial time-reversal-breaking superconductor. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we chart the quantum phase diagram and reveal the boundary criticalities encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Additionally, using renormalization group analysis, we compute the boundary critical exponent up to two loops. Remarkably, the simulations and two-loop renormalization group calculations consistently demonstrate that the presence of the boundary Majorana fermion at the special transition gives rise to a new type of boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed point. We conclude with a discussion of possible experimental realizations in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems, thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial, exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's anomalous pairing correlations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman black holes: revisiting the Dudley-Finley approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the Kerr-Newman quasinormal mode spectrum in the Dudley-Finley approximation, where the linear gravitoelectromagnetic perturbations are decoupled by "freezing" either one of the fields to its background value. First, we reassess the accuracy of this approximation by comparing it to calculations that solve the coupled system of gravitoelectromagnetic perturbation equations across the subextremal spin-charge parameter space. We find that for the $(\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$, $(2,2,1)$, and $(3,3,0)$ modes, the agreement is typically within $10\%$ and $1\%$ for the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies, respectively. Next, we investigate the spectrum in the near-extremal limit, and study the family of long-lived ("zero-damped") gravitational modes. We find that the near-extremal parameter space consists of subregions containing either only zero-damped modes, or zero-damped modes alongside modes that retain nonzero damping. We derive analytic expressions for the boundaries between these regions. Moreover, we discuss the connection between the zero-damped and damped modes in the Dudley-Finley approximation and the "near-horizon/photon-sphere" modes of the full Kerr-Newman spectrum. Finally, we analyze the behavior of the quadrupolar gravitational modes with large overtone numbers $n$, and study their trajectories in the complex plane.</description>

Abstract: Light-flavor baryon resonances in the $J^P=3/2^+$, $J^P=5/2^+$, and $J^P=5/2^-$ families are investigated in a soft-wall AdS/QCD model at finite temperature, including the zero temperature limit. Regge-like trajectories relating the configurational entropy underlying these resonances to both the radial quantum number and the baryon mass spectra are constructed, allowing for the extrapolation of the higher-spin light-flavor baryonic mass spectra to higher values of the radial quantum number. The configurational entropy is shown to increase drastically with temperature, in the range beyond T ~ 38 MeV. The mass spectra of baryon families are analyzed, supporting a phase transition nearly above the Hagedorn</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop3) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop3 star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/CE/ET, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter models from the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies: Self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parametric study of the spacetime structures in the dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solution in Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. We derive expressions for photon sphere radii and horizons for this metric in terms of the conformal gravity parameters, from which we then obtain analytic formulae for extremal limits and Hawking temperatures. Due to the surprising lack of the inverse quadratic $1/r^2$ term in this fourth-order metric, there is no guarantee for the innermost horizon of a black hole spacetime to be a Cauchy horizon, which is in direct contrast to the corresponding metric in general relativity. For example, for certain parameter values, a ``nested black hole'' is seen to exist; in such a spacetime, we find a Cauchy horizon trapped between two event horizons, which is not a structure known to be obtainable in standard general relativity. In addition to such exotic spacetimes, we also find a critical value for the electric and magnetic charges, at which the stable and unstable photon spheres of the metric merge, and we obtain extremal limits where three horizons collide.</description>

Abstract: Purpose To investigate synthesis of nuclei in pycnonuclear reactions in dense medium of neutron stars on the basis of understanding, how the compound nucleus is formed during collision of two nuclei. To implement microscopic formulation of nuclear interactions and fusion in pycnonuclear reactions in dense medium. Methods (1) Nuclei synthesis in pycnonuclear reaction in dense medium of neutron star is investigated in the folding approximation of the cluster model. (2) Formation of compound nucleus in dense medium is studied with the method of Multiple Internal Reflections. Results (1) Wave functions of resonance states of \isotope[24]{Mg} are determined by interaction of two \isotope[12]{C} nuclei. (2) Clear maxima of probability of formation of compound nucleus in dense stellar medium are established at first time. (3) Difference between quasibound energies for potential of Woods-Saxon type and folding potentials with the shell-model approximation for wave functions is essential. (4) Formation of the compound nucleus is much more probable in the quasibound states than in states of zero-point vibrations. (5) Only the first quasibound energies for $\isotope[12]{C} + \isotope[12]{C}$ are smaller than the barrier maximums. At these energies compound nuclear system has barrier which prevents its decay going through tunneling phenomenon. This is the new excited nucleus \isotope[24]{Mg} synthesised in the neutron star. \item[Conclusions] Cluster approach with folding potential provides significant modification of picture of formation of compound nucleus, previously obtained concerning the potential of Woods-Saxon type. The highest precision is provided by the folding potential, created by semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and shell-model description of the internal structure of interacting $p$-shell nuclei.</description>

Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis(ETH) is a standard tool to understand the thermalization properties of an isolated quantum system. Its generalization to higher order correlations of matrix elements of local operators, dubbed the full ETH, predicts the decomposition of higher-order correlation function into thermal free cumulants. In this work, we numerically test these predictions of full ETH using exact diagonalization of two spin models: the Ising and the XXZ Heisenberg models. The differences from the behavior of full ETH prediction in chaotic systems are highlighted and contrasted along the way. We also show that although in these integrable spin models the dynamics of the four-time correlators, specifically the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), is encoded in the fourth order free cumulant, it exhibits late-time dynamics that is different from nonintegrable systems.</description>

      <title>Identifying chiral topological order in microscopic spin models by modular commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral central charge $c_-$ is a key topological invariant of the edge characterizing the bulk two-dimensional chiral topological order, but its direct evaluation in microscopic spin models has long been a challenge, especially for non-abelian topological order. Building on the recently developed modular commutator formalism, we numerically obtain $c_-$ directly from single ground-state wave functions of two-dimensional interacting spin models that have chiral topological order. This provides a geometry-independent and bulk diagnostic of chirality. We study two nonintegrable systems -- the Zeeman-Kitaev honeycomb model and the kagome antiferromagnet -- both subjected to scalar spin chirality perturbations. We find that the modular commutator yields results consistent with the expected topological quantum field theories. We also compute the topological entanglement entropy which provides an independent diagnostic of the topological orders. Our work establishes modular commutators as a powerful numerical probe of chiral topological order in strongly correlated quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian statistics of de Sitter spectators: A perturbative derivation of stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar fields interacting with the primordial curvature perturbation during inflation may communicate their statistics to the latter. This situation motivates the study of how the probability density function (PDF) of a light spectator field $\varphi$ in a pure de Sitter space-time, becomes non-Gaussian under the influence of a scalar potential ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$. One approach to this problem is offered by the stochastic formalism introduced by Starobinsky and Yokoyama. It results in a Fokker-Planck equation for the time-dependent PDF $\rho (\varphi , t)$ describing the statistics of $\varphi$ which, in the limit of equilibrium gives one back the solution $\rho (\varphi) \propto \exp \big[ - \frac{8 \pi^2}{3 H^4} {\mathcal V(\varphi)} \big]$. We study the derivation of $\rho (\varphi , t)$ using quantum field theory tools. Our approach yields an almost Gaussian distribution function, distorted by minor corrections comprised of terms proportional to powers of $\mathcal O_\varphi {\mathcal V(\varphi)}$, where $\mathcal O_\varphi$ stands for a derivative operator acting on ${\mathcal V(\varphi)}$ proportional to $\Delta N$, the number of $e$-folds succeeding the Hubble-horizon crossing of $\varphi$'s wavelengths. This general form is obtained perturbatively and remains valid even with loop corrections. Our solution satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation that receives corrections with respect to the one found within the stochastic approach, allowing us to comment on the validity of the standard equilibrium solution for generic potentials. We posit that higher order corrections to the Fokker-Planck equation may become important towards the equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heterotic string theories in nine and eight dimensions. We identify the disconnected part of the spacetime gauge group by studying the outer automorphism of the charge lattices. The absence of the global symmetry indicates the existence of non-supersymmetric codimension two branes. Moreover, we provide a list of gauge groups and matter contents of non-supersymmetric rank-reduced heterotic string theories (a branch corresponding to the $E_8$ string on $S^1$) from the orbifolding of the outer automorphism as well as the fermion parity. We also provide examples in eight dimensions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Strings in Type IIB Calabi--Yau Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite distance limits in the complex structure moduli space of Type IIB compactifications on Calabi--Yau threefolds, in light of the Emergent String Conjecture. We focus on the so-called type II limits, which, based on the asymptotic behaviour of the physical couplings in the low-energy effective theory, are candidates for emergent string limits. However, due to the absence of Type IIB branes of suitable dimensionality, the emergence of a unique critical string accompanied by a tower of Kaluza--Klein states has so far remained elusive. By considering a broad class of type II$_b$ limits, corresponding to so-called Tyurin degenerations, and studying the asymptotic behaviour of four-dimensional EFT strings in this geometry, we argue that the worldsheet theory of the latter describes a unique critical heterotic string on $T^2\times\mathrm{K3}$ with a gauge bundle whose rank depends on $b$. In addition, we establish the presence of an infinite tower of BPS particles arising from wrapped D3-branes by identifying a suitable set of special Lagrangian 3-cycles in the geometry. The associated BPS invariants are conjectured to be counted by generalisations of modular forms. As a consistency check, we further show that in special cases mirror symmetry identifies the EFT strings with the well-understood emergent string limits in the K\"ahler moduli space of Type IIA compactifications on K3-fibred Calabi--Yau threefolds. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Emergent String Conjecture for type II limits which do not correspond to Tyurin degenerations, and predict new constraints on the possible geometries of type II degenerations which resemble those arising in the Kulikov classification of degenerations of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics in which interactions are determined by an auxiliary-field potential, with causality ensuring a unique solution to the auxiliary-field equation. The long-standing problem of an explicit Lagrangian for the generic `analytic' theory is simply solved by restriction to potentials that are even functions of the auxiliary field. In this case the Lagrangian can be linearised in quadratic field-strength scalars by the introduction of an additional pseudoscalar auxiliary field; this generalises, to all analytic self-dual theories, a well-known construction of the Born-Infeld theory.</description>

      <title>Duality and four-dimensional black holes: gravitational waves, algebraically special solutions, pole skipping, and the spectral duality relation in holographic thermal CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of gravitational waves and other classical fields on specifically four-dimensional backgrounds of black holes exhibits electric-magnetic-like dualities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of such dualities in terms of geometrical quantities with a physically-intuitive interpretation. In turn, we explain the interplay between the algebraic structure of black hole spacetimes and their associated dualities. For large classes of black hole geometries, explicit constructions are presented. We then use these results and apply them to the holographic study of three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), discussing how such dualities place stringent constraints on the thermal spectra of correlators. In particular, the dualities enforce the recently-developed spectral duality relation along with a multitude of implications for the physics of thermal CFTs. A number of numerical results supporting our conclusions is also presented, including a demonstration of how the longitudinal spectrum of quasinormal modes determines the transverse spectrum, and vice versa.</description>

Abstract: The charged (symmetry-resolved) vacuum R\'enyi entanglement entropy on a disk is computed in the limit of large U(1) global charge for any R\'enyi index. We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.</description>

      <title>Soft breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the $\phi^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional scalar field theory that modifies the standard $\phi^4$ model by introducing a smooth breaking of translational invariance through a hyperbolic generalizing function. This function explicitly breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry; however, it also introduces a mechanism capable of generating new energy minima (vacua) and of localizing or delocalizing field fluctuations around these vacua. Thus, this mechanism enables the continuous transformation of the kink/antikink-like configurations into compacted asymmetric double-kink/antikink structures. Accordingly, this transformation gives rise to new classes of configurations resembling asymmetric non-topological solitons, characterized by a soft breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. These findings are particularly compelling, as they are consistent with results describing Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) domain walls in dimerized polymer systems.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dynamical Systems Toolkit: Coupled Fields in Multiscalar Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a two-field scalar model consisting of an axion-saxion pair with both kinetic and potential couplings, as motivated by string theory compactifications. We extend the dynamical systems (DS) toolkit by introducing a new set of variables that not only close the system and enable a systematic stability analysis, but also disentangle the role of the kinetic coupling. Within this framework we derive a compact, general expression for the non-geodesicity (turning-rate) parameter evaluated at fixed points, valid for arbitrary couplings. This provides a transparent way of diagnosing non-geodesic dynamics, with direct applications to both dark energy and multifield inflation. We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish analytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this case, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as attractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion shift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent non-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full dynamics are taken into account. Finally, we illustrate how our approach naturally extends to more realistic string-inspired models, such as power-law axion potentials combined with exponential saxion couplings, and present an explicit supergravity realisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Grozdanov:2024wgo}, we derived a spectral duality relation applicable to the spectra of 3$d$ conformal field theories (CFTs) and their holographically dual 4$d$ black holes. In this work, we further elaborate on the properties of this duality relation and argue that the same relation can be applied to certain pairs of thermal correlator spectra in large-$N$ quantum field theories in any number of spacetime dimensions, provided the correlators are meromorphic functions with only simple poles and satisfy the thermal product formula. We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual.</description>

Abstract: Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications, constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence scenarios within consistent effective theories.</description>

Abstract: In the context of asymptotic $2$-to-$2$ scattering process in AdS/CFT, the Connected Wedge Theorem identifies the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between suitable boundary subregions, referred to as decision regions, as a necessary but not sufficient condition for bulk-only scattering processes, i.e., nonempty bulk scattering region $S_0$. Recently, Liu and Leutheusser proposed an enlarged bulk scattering region $S_E$ and conjectured that the non-emptiness of $S_E$ fully characterizes the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between decision regions. Here, we provide a geometrical or general relativity proof for a slightly modified version of their conjecture.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and BRST Cohomology of Schwarzschild in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild (KS) double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content remains largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the KS double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian KS ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the KS Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the subalgebra generated by time translations and spatial rotations. This finding reveals a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no simple counterpart in this constrained gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition. This result serves as a crucial consistency check, validating the kinematic algebraic collapse within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the second paper, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector (CKV) class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework to definitively test the structural obstruction.</description>

      <title>Limits of Symmetry in Schwarzschild: CKVs and BRST Triviality in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In the first paper in this series, we showed that the infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical spectrum is restricted to global isometries.</description>

      <title>Generalized Mandelstam-Leibbrandt regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic non-covariant gauges are used often in string theory, Chern-Simons theory, gravitation and gauge theories. Loop integrals, however, have spurious singularities that need to be regularized. The most popular and consistent regularization is the Mandelstam- Leibbrandt(ML) prescription.
  This paper extends the ML prescription outside the light cone. It shares all the properties of
  light-cone ML regularization: It preserves naive power counting and gauge
  invariance. Moreover, using dimensional regularization(DR), we get a closed
  form for the basic integrals, including divergent and finite pieces. These results simplify calculations in gauge theories and open new avenues for applications in non-local models.</description>

      <title>Quantum dissipative effects for a real scalar field coupled to a dynamical Neumann surface in d+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dissipative effects for a system consisting of a massless real scalar field satisfying Neumann boundary conditions on a space and time-dependent surface, in d+1 dimensions. We focus on the comparison of the results for this system with the ones corresponding to Dirichlet conditions, and the same surface space-time geometry. We show that, in d=1, the effects are equal up to second order for rather arbitrary surfaces, and up to fourth order for wavelike surfaces. For d&gt;1, we find general expressions for their difference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.08091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a black hole and the relationship between photon orbits and the thermodynamic phase transitions of the black hole in AdS spacetime. We then examine the interactions between the microstructures of the black hole using Ruppeiner geometry. The radius of the photon orbit and the minimum impact parameter behave non-monotonically below the critical point, mimicking the behaviour of Hawking temperature and pressure in extended thermodynamics. Their changes during the large black hole--small black hole phase transition serve as the order parameter, possessing a critical exponent of $1/2$. The results demonstrate that the gravity and thermodynamics of the Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a black hole are closely related. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic geometry, which provides insight into the microstructure interactions of the black hole. We find that the large black hole phase is analogous to a bosonic gas with a dominant attractive interaction, while the small black hole phase behaves like an anyonic gas with both attractive and repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Gauging a superposition of fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauged fermionic projected entangled pair states (GFPEPS) and their Gaussian counterpart (GGFPEPS) are a novel type of lattice gauge theory Ansatz state that combine ideas from the Monte Carlo and tensor network communities. In particular, computation of observables for such states boils down to a Monte Carlo integration over possible gauge field configurations that have probabilities dictated by a fermionic tensor network contraction that accounts for the matter in that background configuration. Crucially, this probability distribution is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem.
  When the underlying PEPS is Gaussian, tensor network contraction can be done efficiently, and in this scenario the Ansatz has been tested well numerically. In this work we propose to gauge superpositions of Gaussian PEPS and demonstrate that one can still efficiently compute observables when few Gaussians are in the superposition. As we will argue, the latter is exactly the case for bound states on top of the strongly interacting LGT vacuum, which makes this Ansatz particularly suitable for that scenario.
  As a corollary, we will provide an exact representation of the LGT ground state as a gauged PEPS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole solutions within a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on spacetime thermodynamics developed by Alonso-Serrano and Li\v{s}ka. The field equations are traceless, similarly to unimodular gravity, and include quadratic curvature corrections. We find that static, spherically symmetric, vacuum spacetimes in this theory split into two branches. The first branch is indistinguishable from corresponding solutions in unimodular gravity and describes Schwarzschild-(Anti) de Sitter black holes. The second branch instead describes horizonless solutions and is characterized by large values of the spatial curvature. We analyze the dynamics of first-order metric perturbations on both branches, showing that there are no deviations from unimodular gravity at this level.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Effects on False Vacuum Decay in Atomic Quantum Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temperature plays a crucial role in metastable phenomena, not only by contributing to determine the state (phase) of a system, but also ruling the decay probability to more stable states. Such a situation is encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous work 2305.04946, we found that supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data support the hypothesis that late time cosmic acceleration is caused by the potential energy of a scalar field descending its potential, as suggested by holographically defined models of quantum gravity. In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \approx V_0 + V_1 \phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $&gt;5 \sigma$ discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\Delta \chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z &lt; 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.</description>

      <title>A new exact rotating spacetime in vacuum: The Kerr--Levi-Civita Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new rotating solution of Einstein's theory in vacuum by exploiting the Lie point symmetries of the field equations in the complex potential formalism of Ernst. In particular, we perform a discrete symmetry transformation, known as inversion, of the gravitational potential associated with the Kerr metric. The resulting metric describes a rotating generalization of the Schwarzschild--Levi-Civita spacetime, and we refer to it as the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric. We study the key geometric features of this novel spacetime, which turns out to be free of curvature singularities, topological defects, and closed timelike curves. These attractive properties are also common to the extremal black hole and the super-spinning case. The solution is algebraically general (Petrov-type I), and its horizon structure is exactly that of the Kerr spacetime. The ergoregions, however, are strongly influenced by the Levi-Civita-like asymptotic structure, producing an effect akin to the magnetized Kerr--Newman and swirling solutions. Interestingly, while its static counterpart permits a Kerr--Schild representation, the Kerr--Levi-Civita metric does not admit such a formulation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice II: Nonperturbative Curvature Perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics presented in arXiv:2410.23942, we investigate the role of the nonlinear relation between the inflaton field configuration and the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, the key observable after inflation. Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together with arXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>ACT inflation and its influence on reheating era in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observational viability of non-minimally coupled scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity, during inflation and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, from the perspective of the latest ACT-DR6 combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO data. It turns out that the ACT result considerably affects the inflationary e-fold number compared to the case where only Planck 2018 data is taken into account. The viable parameter spaces corresponding to the inflationary ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO substantially influence the reheating phenomenology via the reheating equation of state ($w_\mathrm{eff}$) and the reheating temperature. In particular, the ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO data seems to disfavor $w_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 1/3$ during the reheating stage, which is unlike to that of only Planck 2018 case. These reveal how the ACT-DR6 data hits the early universe phenomenology from inflation to reheating in the context of higher curvature like scalar-Einstein-GB theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Black holes in the external Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism, is built by means of a Lie point symmetry of the Ernst equations, the Harrison transformation. The new spacetime describes a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded into a general external back-reacting electromagnetic field, which is the superposition of the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson and the Bonnor-Melvin ones. The relation between the two homogeneous electromagnetic fields is clarified. Conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics are analysed. Swirling generalisations are also considered. Limits to the known metrics such as Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson, Schwarzschild-Bonnor-Melvin and Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum-corrected three-dimensional AdS space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum-corrected solitons in global, three-dimensional, anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. These static solitons have a regular origin and arise as solutions of the linearized quantum-corrected Einstein equations (LQCEE). On the right-hand-side of the LQCEE is the renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally coupled, quantum scalar field in a nonrotating thermal state, computed in quantum field theory (QFT), or using relativistic kinetic theory (RKT). We calculate the mass of the solitons and compare the results from QFT and RKT.</description>

      <title>On the (Im)possibility of Electrically Charged Planck Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I revisit whether black-hole remnants, from sub-Planckian compact objects to Planck relics and up to (super)massive black holes, can preserve Standard-Model (SM) electric charge. Two exterior-field mechanisms -- Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production -- robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\rm stop}^{(e)}\!\propto\! r_h^2$ that is $\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative ``no-Schwinger'' limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordstr\"om extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon polarized images of a rotating hairy Horndeski black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Hou \emph{et al.} [Astrophys. J. Lett. \textbf{988}, L51 (2025)] revealed that the Electric Vector Position Angle (EVPA) of polarization vectors in the near-horizon images is governed solely by the spacetime geometry and is irrespective of the plasma flows. Here, we generalize the study to the scenario of a rotating hair black hole within the Horndeski gravity and probe the effects of the hairy parameter on the EVPA. For a fixed inclination, the hairy parameter enhances the observed EVPA in the slowly rotating case, but decreases it in the rapidly rotating case. For a fixed black hole spin, the influence of the hairy parameter on the observed EVPA under different observer inclinations is further modulated by the azimuthal angle of the observed polarization vector. The hairy parameter's impact is more distinct in the low inclination case as the azimuthal angle lies within a specific range, but is almost independent of the observer inclination as the azimuthal angle is beyond this specific range. Furthermore, the dependence of the hairy parameter's impact on the EVPA is stronger with respect to the black hole spin than to the inclination angle. These results could help to further understand the near-horizon polarized images and Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <title>Is our vacuum global in an economical 331 model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the economical 331 model, based on $\beta=-1/\sqrt{3}$, with three $SU(3)$ triplets with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting scalar potential is commonly used in phenomenology. We systematically determine all the potential minima and obtain the conditions under which the electroweak vacuum is global with the help of orbit space methods. For the case the electroweak vacuum is not global, we calculate bounds on the scalar couplings from metastability. We find a parametrisation of the potential couplings in terms of physical quantities and use it to show the available parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a conjecture that clarifies the relationship between the number of degree d elliptic curves in complex four-dimensional projective Fano hypersurfaces and their degree d elliptic Gromov-Witten (GW) invariants. The elliptic GW invariants are computed using the elliptic virtual structure constants proposed in our previous works.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Helicity, Magnetic Monopoles, and Higgs Winding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields, from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology. It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$. However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime. In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles. We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change. The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the chiral anomaly in the early universe.</description>

      <title>N=1 Supersymmetric Axionic Model from the CFJ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose behind this work has been to construct a supersymmetric extension of axionic electrodynamics, inspired by the supersymmetric Lorentz-symmetry-violating Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) scenario. Thus, in addition to the axion and the photon, our model naturally incorporates its supersymmetric partners - the axino and the photino - and allows for the interaction between them. This enriches the Axionic Electrodynamics not only from a theoretical standpoint but also for its phenomenological relevance, providing additional interactions between possible dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Dynamical equilibria of fast neutrino flavor conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.</description>
