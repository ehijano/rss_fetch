      <title>Scaling Intelligence: Designing Data Centers for Next-Gen Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8 trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization complexity, and sustain the rapid evolution of AI capabilities.</description>

      <title>ChatModel: Automating Reference Model Design and Verification with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexity of integrated circuit designs continues to escalate, the functional verification becomes increasingly challenging. Reference models, critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of 5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model generation and validation.</description>

      <title>Acore-CIM: build accurate and reliable mixed-signal CIM cores with RISC-V controlled self-calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing accurate and reliable Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures is becoming a key research focus to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) tasks on hardware, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In that regard, there has been significant interest in analog and mixed-signal CIM architectures aimed at increasing the efficiency of data storage and computation to handle the massive amount of data needed by DNNs. Specifically, resistive mixed-signal CIM cores are pushed by recent progresses in emerging Non-Volatile Memory (eNVM) solutions. Yet, mixed-signal CIM computing cores still face several integration and reliability challenges that hinder their large-scale adoption into end-to-end AI computing systems. In terms of integration, resistive and eNVM-based CIM cores need to be integrated with a control processor to realize end-to-end AI acceleration. Moreover, SRAM-based CIM architectures are still more efficient and easier to program than their eNVM counterparts. In terms of reliability, analog circuits are more susceptible to variations, leading to computation errors and degraded accuracy. This work addresses these two challenges by proposing a self-calibrated mixed-signal CIM accelerator SoC, fabricated in 22-nm FDSOI technology. The integration is facilitated by (1) the CIM architecture, combining the density and ease of SRAM-based weight storage with multi-bit computation using linear resistors, and (2) an open-source programming and testing strategy for CIM systems. The accuracy and reliability are enabled through an automated RISC-V controlled on-chip calibration, allowing us to improve the compute SNR by 25 to 45% across multiple columns to reach 18-24 dB. To showcase further integration possibilities, we show how our proof-of-concept SoC can be extended to recent high-density linear resistor technologies for enhanced computing performance.</description>

      <title>From Block to Byte: Transforming PCIe SSDs with CXL Memory Protocol and Instruction Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores how Compute Express Link (CXL) can transform PCIe-based block storage into a scalable, byte-addressable working memory. We address the challenges of adapting block storage to CXL's memory-centric model by emphasizing cacheability as a key enabler and advocating for Type 3 endpoint devices, referred to as CXL-SSDs. To validate our approach, we prototype a CXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms, Determinism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data persistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves 10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces latency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements. In workloads with high locality, CXL-SSD approaches DRAM-like performance due to efficient on-chip caching. This work highlights the feasibility of integrating block storage into CXL's ecosystem and provides a foundation for future memory-storage convergence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duplication-based redundancy schemes have proven to be effective in designing fully-resilient Quasi-delay Insensitive (QDI) asynchronous circuits. The complete resiliency, however, is accompanied by significant energy, latency, and area overhead. This paper presents a novel error-tolerant Null Convention Logic (NCL) architecture based on selective redundancy. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of area and energy utilization as compared to existing duplication-based NCL designs, targeting an image processing application.</description>

      <title>Optimization of bi-directional gated loop cell based on multi-head attention mechanism for SSD health state classification model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%, demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud computing data centers and edge storage environments.</description>

      <title>VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?
  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</description>

      <title>Serving Large Language Models on Huawei CloudMatrix384</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910C NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (&lt;50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s per NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.</description>
