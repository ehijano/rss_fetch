      <title>A Kunen-Like Model with a Critical Failure of the Continuum Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model of the form $L[A,U]$ that exhibits the simplest structural behavior of $\sigma$-complete ultrafilters in a model of set theory with a single measurable cardinal $\kappa$ , yet satisfies $2^\kappa = \kappa^{++}$. This result establishes a limitation on the extent to which structural properties of ultrafilters can determine the cardinal arithmetic at large cardinals, and answers a question posed by Goldberg concerning the failure of the Continuum Hypothesis at a measurable cardinal in a model of the Ultrapower Axiom. The construction introduces several methods in extensions of embeddings theory and fine-structure-based forcing, designed to control the behavior of non-normal ultrafilters in generic extensions.</description>

      <title>Comparing Anti-foundation Axioms by Comparing Identity Conditions for Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-well-founded set theory, which anti-foundation axiom is philosophically justified, BAFA, FAFA, SAFA, AFA, or some other? In this paper, we investigate a general approach to answering this question: first, consider which identity condition for sets is justified; second, consider which anti-foundation axiom it justifies. Specifically, we study in detail two plausible identity conditions.</description>

      <title>Note on a differential algebra bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article, Freitag, Moosa and the author showed that in differentially closed fields of characteristic zero, if two types are nonorthogonal, then their n+3 and m+3 Morley powers are not weakly orthogonal, where n and m are their respective Lascar ranks.
  In this short note, we prove that the bound is tight: there are such types with weakly orthogonal n+2 and m+2 Morley powers. The types in question were constructed by Freitag and Moosa as examples of types with degree of nonminimality 2. As interesting as our result are our methods: we rely mostly on Galois theory and some descent argument for types, combined with the failure of the inverse Galois problem over constant parameters.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of free Steiner quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A free Steiner quasigroup is a free object in the variety of Steiner quasigroups. Free Steiner quasigroups are characterised by the existence of a levelled construction that starts with a free base - that is, a set of elements none of which is a product of the others, and which generate the quasigroup. Then each element in a free Steiner quasigroup $M$ can be obtained as a term on the free base. We characterise homomorphisms between substructures of a free Steiner quasigroup where one generator is replaced by a term in the original generators. The characterisation depends on certain synctactic properties of the term in question.</description>

      <title>Extensional realizability and choice for dependent types in intuitionistic set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "Extensional realizability for intuitionistic set theory", we introduced an extensional variant of generic realizability, where realizers act extensionally on realizers, and showed that this form of realizability provides "inner" models of $\sf CZF$ (constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory) and $\sf IZF$ (intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), that further validate ${\sf AC}_{\sf FT}$ (the axiom of choice in all finite types). In this paper, we show that extensional generic realizability validates several choice principles for dependent types, all exceeding ${\sf AC}_{\sf FT}$. We then show that adding such choice principles does not change the arithmetic part of either $\sf CZF$ or $\sf IZF$.</description>

      <title>Different Theories of Parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stanis{\l}aw Le\'sniewski's mereology was formulated in a specific way, deviating from standard formalizations. Nowadays, Le\'sniewski's theory is presented in the form of an elementary theory or translated into the language of the theory of relational structures. In this article, firstly, we look at existentially neutral theories, in which we do not postulate the existence of any other collective sets than those obtained from the definition and the basic properties of the relation of being a part. We also examine some existentially involved theories of parts. Among them, there is Grzegorczykian mereology and Le\'sniewskian mereology. One of the main principles of mereology is the transitivity of the concept of being a part of. This property is often questioned in the literature on the subject. In the final part, we present problems related to the transitivity of this concept.</description>

      <title>Topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Polish groups with the generic point property, the property that every minimal action on a compact space admits a comeager orbit. By a result of Ben Yaacov, Melleray, and Tsankov, this class of Polish groups contains those with metrizable universal minimal flow, and by a construction of Kwiatkowska, this containment is proper. Earlier work of the authors gives a robust generalization of the class of Polish groups with metrizable universal minimal flow that makes sense for all topological groups. In this work, we do the same for the class of Polish groups with the generic point property, thus defining the class of topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics and giving several characterizations of this class. These characterizations yield novel results even in the Polish case; for instance, we show that the universal minimal flow of a locally compact non-compact Polish group has no points of first countability. Motivated by work of Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c that connects Ramsey properties of classes of structures to dynamical properties of automorphism groups, we state and prove an abstract KPT correspondence which characterizes topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics. As an application, we prove that this class is absolute between models of set theory, and then use forcing and absoluteness arguments to further explore these classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>A Model Theoretic Perspective on Matrix Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.09024v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper natural necessary and sufficient conditions for quantifier elimination of matrix rings $M_n(K)$ in the language of rings expanded by two unary functions, naming the trace and transposition, are identified. This is used together with invariant theory to prove quantifier elimination when $K$ is an intersection of real closed fields. On the other hand, it is shown that finding a natural \textit{definable} expansion with quantifier elimination of the theory of $M_n({\mathbb C})$ is closely related to the infamous simultaneous conjugacy problem in matrix theory. Finally, for various natural structures describing dimension-free matrices it is shown that no such elimination results can hold by establishing undecidability results.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial single axiom schemata and their quasi-nontriviality of Le\'{s}niewski-Ishimoto's propositional ontology $\bf L_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07030v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On March 8, 1995, was found the following \it nontrivial \rm single axiom-schema characteristic of Le\'{s}niewski-Ishimoto's propositional ontology $\bf L_1$ (Inou\'{e}, 1995b \cite{inoue16}). $$(\mathrm{A_{M8})} \enspace \epsilon ab \wedge \epsilon cd . \supset . \epsilon aa \wedge \epsilon cc \wedge (\epsilon bc \supset . \epsilon ad \wedge \epsilon ba).$$
  In this paper, we shall present the progress about the above axiom-schema from 1995. Here we shall give two criteria \it nontiriviality \rm and \it quasi-nontriviality \rm in order to distinguish two axiom schemata. As main results, among others, in \S 6 - \S 8, we shall give the simplified axiom schemata ($\rm A_{S1}$), ($\rm A_{S2}$), ($\rm A_{S3N}$) and ($\rm A_{S3Nd}$) based on ($\mathrm{A_{M8}}$), their nontriviality and quasi-nontriviality. In \S 9 - \S 11, we shall give a lot of conjectures for nontrivial single axiom schemata for $\bf L_1$. We shall conclude this paper with some remarks in \S 12.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Blok-Esakia Theorem establishes that the lattice of superintuitionistic logics is isomorphic to the lattice of extensions of Grzegorczyk's logic. We prove that the Blok-Esakia isomorphism $\sigma$ does not extend to the fragments of the corresponding predicate logics of already one fixed variable. In other words, we prove that $\sigma$ is no longer an isomorphism from the lattice of extensions of the monadic intuitionistic logic to the lattice of extensions of the monadic Grzegorczyk logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that types over real algebraically closed sets are stationary, both for the theory of separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection and for the theory of beautiful pairs of algebraically closed field. The proof is given in a general setup without using specific features of theories of fields.
  Moreover, we generalize Delon's result that separably closed fields of infinite degree of imperfection do not have geometric elimination of imaginaries. Using work of Wagner on subgroups of stable groups, we obtain a general criterion yielding the failure of geometric elimination of imaginaries. This criterion applies in particular to beautiful pairs of algebraically closed fields, giving an alternative proof of the corresponding result of Pillay and Vassiliev.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>
