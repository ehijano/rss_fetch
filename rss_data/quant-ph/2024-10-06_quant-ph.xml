      <title>Machine Learning Aided Scattering Mitigation in a Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sources with strong correlations are essential but delicate resources in quantum information science and engineering. Decoherence and loss are the primary factors that degrade nonclassical quantum correlations, with scattering playing a role in both processes. In this work, we present a method that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a machine learning technique known for its effectiveness in time-series prediction, to mitigate the detrimental impact of scattering in quantum systems. Our setup involves generating two-mode squeezed light via four-wave mixing in warm rubidium vapor, with one mode subjected to a scatterer to disrupt quantum correlations. Mutual information between the two modes is used as the metric for quantum correlations. We demonstrate a 74.7~\% recovery of mutual information and 87.7~\% recovery of two-mode squeezing, despite significant photon loss that would otherwise eliminate quantum correlations. This approach marks a significant step toward recovering quantum correlations from random disruptions without the need for hardware modifications, paving the way for practical applications of quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Simplified projection on total spin zero for state preparation on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple algorithm for projecting on $J=0$ states of a many-body system by performing a series of rotations to remove states with angular momentum projections greater than zero. Existing methods rely on unitary evolution with the two-body operator $J^2$, which when expressed in the computational basis contains many complicated Pauli strings requiring Trotterization and leading to very deep quantum circuits. Our approach performs the necessary projections using the one-body operators $J_x$ and $J_z$. By leveraging the method of Cartan decomposition, the unitary transformations that perform the projection can be parameterized as a product of a small number of two-qubit rotations, with angles determined by an efficient classical optimization. Given the reduced complexity in terms of gates, this approach can be used to prepare approximate ground states of even-even nuclei by projecting onto the $J=0$ component of deformed Hartree-Fock states. We estimate the resource requirements in terms of the universal gate set {$H$,$S$,CNOT,$T$} and briefly discuss a variant of the algorithm that projects onto $J=1/2$ states of a system with an odd number of fermions.</description>

      <title>MQT Qudits: A Software Framework for Mixed-Dimensional Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds great promise for surpassing the limits of classical devices in many fields. Despite impressive developments, however, current research is primarily focused on qubits. At the same time, quantum hardware based on multi-level, qudit, systems offers a range of advantages, including expanded gate sets, higher information density, and improved computational efficiency, which might play a key role in overcoming not only the limitations of classical machines but also of current qubit-based quantum devices. However, working with qudits faces challenges not only in experimental control but particularly in algorithm development and quantum software. In this work, we introduce MQT Qudits, an open-source tool, which, as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), is built to assist in designing and implementing applications for mixed-dimensional qudit devices. We specify a standardized language for mixed-dimension systems and discuss circuit specification, compilation to hardware gate sets, efficient circuit simulation, and open challenges. MQT Qudits is available at github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qudits and on pypi at pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits.</description>

      <title>GTQCP: Greedy Topology-Aware Quantum Circuit Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Greedy Topology-Aware Quantum Circuit Partitioning (GTQCP), a novel quantum gate circuit partitioning method which partitions circuits by applying a greedy heuristic to the qubit dependency graph of the circuit. GTQCP is compared against three other gate partitioning methods, two of which (QuickPartitioner and ScanPartitioner) are part of the Berkley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. GTQCP is shown to have 18% run time improvement ratio over the fastest approach (QuickPartitioner), and a 96% improvement over the highest quality approach (ScanPartitioner). The algorithm also demonstrates nearly identical result quality (number of partitions) compared with ScanPartitioner, and a 38% quality improvement over QuickPartitioner.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product Structure Geometry under Unitary Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, complex dynamics delocalize the physical degrees of freedom. This spreading of information throughout the system has been extensively studied in relation to quantum thermalization, scrambling, and chaos. Locality is typically defined with respect to a tensor product structure (TPS) which identifies the local subsystems of the quantum system. In this paper, we investigate a simple geometric measure of operator spreading by quantifying the distance of the space of local operators from itself evolved under a unitary channel. We show that this TPS distance is related to the scrambling properties of the dynamics between the local subsystems and coincides with the entangling power of the dynamics in the case of a symmetric bipartition. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for the maximization of the TPS distance and show that the class of 2-unitaries provides examples of dynamics that achieve this maximal value. For Hamiltonian evolutions at short times, the characteristic timescale of the TPS distance depends on scrambling rates determined by the strength of interactions between the local subsystems. Beyond this short-time regime, the behavior of the TPS distance is explored through numerical simulations of prototypical models exhibiting distinct ergodic properties, ranging from quantum chaos and integrability to Hilbert space fragmentation and localization.</description>

      <title>Overcoming sloppiness for enhanced metrology in continuous-variable quantum statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-parameter statistical models may depend only on some functions of the parameters that are fewer than the number of initial parameters themselves. Such \emph{sloppy} statistical models are characterized by a degenerate Fisher Information matrix, indicating that it is impossible to simultaneously estimate all the parameters. In a quantum setting, once an encoding is fixed, the same can happen for the Quantum Fisher Information matrix computed from a sloppy quantum statistical model. In addition to sloppiness, however, further issues of quantum incompatibility can arise. We take a fully Gaussian case-study to investigate the topic, showing that by appropriately scrambling the quantum states in between the encoding of two phase-shift parameters a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, not only sloppiness can be lifted, but also the quantum incompatibility can be put identically to zero, maintaining an enhanced scaling of precision and the covariance of the model with respect to exact values of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of surface phonons in a quantum acoustic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phononic resonators are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, both for applications in quantum computing, communication and sensing, as well as in experiments investigating fundamental physics. Here, we study the decoherence of phonons confined in a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator strongly coupled ($g/2\pi\approx 9$ MHz) to a superconducting transmon qubit. By comparing experimental data with numerical solutions to the Markovian master equation, we report a surface phononic energy decay rate of $\kappa_1/2\pi=480$ kHz and a pure dephasing rate of $\kappa_{\phi}/2\pi=180$ kHz. These rates are in good agreement with the level of decoherence we extract from qubit-assisted spectroscopic measurements of the SAW resonator. We additionally find that the timescales over which coherent driven dynamics and decoherence occur are comparable, highlighting the need to model the composite device as an open quantum system. We discuss possible sources of decoherence in SAW-based quantum acoustic devices and the application of these devices in future quantum acoustic dissipation engineering experiments. The decoherence characterization techniques we employ are broadly applicable for investigating and benchmarking the effects of loss and dephasing on mechanical resonators in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Strategies for running the QAOA at hundreds of qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore strategies aimed at reducing the amount of computation, both quantum and classical, required to run the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). First, following Wurtz et al. [Phys.Rev A 104:052419], we consider the standard QAOA with instance-independent "tree" parameters chosen in advance. These tree parameters are chosen to optimize the MaxCut expectation for large girth graphs. We provide extensive numerical evidence supporting the performance guarantee for tree parameters conjectured in [Phys.Rev A 103:042612] and see that the approximation ratios obtained with tree parameters are typically well beyond the conjectured lower bounds, often comparable to performing a full optimization. This suggests that in practice, the QAOA can achieve near-optimal performance without the need for parameter optimization.
  Next, we modify the warm-start QAOA of Tate et al. [Quantum 7:1121]. The starting state for the QAOA is now an optimized product state associated with a solution of the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm. Surprisingly, the tree parameters continue to perform well for the warm-start QAOA. We find that for random 3-regular graphs with hundreds of vertices, the expected cut obtained by the warm-start QAOA at depth $p \gtrsim 3$ is comparable to that of the standard GW algorithm.
  Our numerics on random instances do not provide general performance guarantees but do provide substantial evidence that there exists a regime of instance sizes in which the QAOA finds good solutions at low depth without the need for parameter optimization. For each instance studied, we classically compute the expected size of the QAOA distribution of cuts; producing the actual cuts requires running on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for the Trotter Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In analog and digital simulations of practically relevant quantum systems, the target dynamics can only be implemented approximately. The Trotter product formula is the most common approximation scheme as it is a generic method which allows tuning accuracy. The Trotter simulation precision will always be inexact for non-commuting operators, but it is currently unknown what the minimum possible error is. This is an important quantity because upper bounds for the Trotter error are known to often be vast overestimates. Here, we present explicit lower bounds on the error, in norm and on states, allowing to derive minimum resource requirements. Numerical comparison with the true error shows that our bounds offer accurate and tight estimates.</description>

      <title>LEGO: QEC Decoding System Architecture for Dynamic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a critical component of FTQC; the QEC decoder is an important part of Classical Computing for Quantum or C4Q. Recent years have seen fast development in real-time QEC decoders. Existing efforts to build real-time decoders have yet to achieve a critical milestone: decoding dynamic logical circuits with error-corrected readout and feed forward. Achieving this requires significant engineering effort to adapt and reconfigure the decoders during runtime, depending on the branching of the logical circuit.
  We present a QEC decoder architecture called LEGO, with the ambitious goal of supporting dynamic logical operations. LEGO employs a novel abstraction called the decoding block to describe the decoding problem of a dynamic logical circuit. Moreover, decoding blocks can be combined with three other ideas to improve the efficiency, accuracy and latency of the decoder. First, they provide data and task parallelisms when combined with fusion-based decoding. Second, they can exploit the pipeline parallelism inside multi-stage decoders. Finally, they serve as basic units of work for computational resource management.
  Using decoding blocks, LEGO can be easily reconfigured to support all QEC settings and to easily accommodate innovations in three interdependent fields: code, logical operations and qubit hardware. In contrast, existing decoders are highly specialized to a specific QEC setting, which leads to redundant research and engineering efforts, slows down innovation, and further fragments the nascent quantum computing industry.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-accelerated entanglement generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation is usually considered a negative factor for observing quantum effects and for harnessing them for quantum technologies. Here we propose a scheme for speeding up the generation of quantum entanglement between two coupled qubits by introducing a strong dissipation channel to one of these qubits. The maximal entanglement is conditionally established by evenly distributing a single excitation between these two qubits. When the excitation is initially held by the dissipative qubit, the dissipation accelerates the excitation re-distribution process for the quantum state trajectory without quantum jumps. Our results show that the time needed to conditionally attain the maximal entanglement is monotonously decreased as the dissipative rate is increased. We further show that this scheme can be generalized to accelerate the production of the W state for the three-qubit system, where one NH qubit is symmetrically coupled to two Hermitian qubits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-induced provable and robust quantum learning advantages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds the unparalleled potentials to enhance, speed up or innovate machine learning. However, an unambiguous demonstration of quantum learning advantage has not been achieved so far. Here, we rigorously establish a noise-robust, unconditional quantum learning advantage in terms of expressivity, inference speed, and training efficiency, compared to commonly-used classical machine learning models. Our proof is information-theoretic and pinpoints the origin of this advantage: quantum entanglement can be used to reduce the communication required by non-local machine learning tasks. In particular, we design a fully classical task that can be solved with unit accuracy by a quantum model with a constant number of variational parameters using entanglement resources, whereas commonly-used classical models must scale at least linearly with the size of the task to achieve a larger-than-exponentially-small accuracy. We further show that the quantum model can be trained with constant time and a number of samples inversely proportional to the problem size. We prove that this advantage is robust against constant depolarization noise. We show through numerical simulations that even though the classical models can have improved performance as their sizes are increased, they would suffer from overfitting. The constant-versus-linear separation, bolstered by the overfitting problem, makes it possible to demonstrate the quantum advantage with relatively small system sizes. We demonstrate, through both numerical simulations and trapped-ion experiments on IonQ Aria, the desired quantum-classical learning separation. Our results provide a valuable guide for demonstrating quantum learning advantages in practical applications with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Correlation Spreading in Quantum Lattice Models with Variable-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we have investigated the spreading of quantum correlations in isolated lattice models with short- or long-range interactions driven far from equilibrium via sudden global quenches. A general theoretical approach relying on a quasiparticle theory is presented. The latter has permitted to unveil a generic expression for the equal-time connected correlation functions valid both for short-range and long-range interacting particle and spin lattice models on a hypercubic lattice. Relying on stationary phase arguments, we have shown that its causality cone displays a universal twofold structure consisting of a correlation edge and a series of local extrema defining the outer and inner structure of the space-time correlations. For short-range interactions, the motion of each structure is ballistic and the associated spreading velocities are related to the group and phase velocities of the quasiparticle dispersion relation of the post-quench Hamiltonian. For long-range interactions of the form $1/|R|^{\alpha}$, the correlation spreading is substantially different due to a possible divergence of group velocity when tuning the power-law exponent $\alpha$. For a divergent group velocity, i.e. the quasi-local regime, we have presented evidence of a universal algebraic structure for the causality cone. While, the correlation edge motion has been found to be always slower than ballistic, the local extrema propagate faster than ballistically and ballistically for gapless and gapped quantum systems respectively. For the local regime implying a well-defined group velocity, we have recovered similar scaling laws and spreading velocities than the short-range case for the causality cone of correlations.</description>

      <title>A variational quantum algorithm by Bayesian Inference with von Mises-Fisher distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver algorithm has gained attentions due to its capability of locating the ground state and ground energy of a Hamiltonian, which is a fundamental task in many physical and chemical problems. Although it has demonstrated promising results, the use of various types of measurements remains a significant obstacle. Recently, a quantum phase estimation algorithm inspired measurement scheme has been proposed to overcome this issue by introducing an additional ancilla system that is coupled to the primary system. Based on this measurement scheme, we present a novel approach that employs Bayesian inference principles together with von Mises-Fisher distribution and theoretically demonstrates the new algorithm's capability in identifying the ground state with certain for various random Hamiltonian matrices. This also opens a new way for exploring the von Mises-Fisher distribution potential in other quantum information science problems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Bivariate Gaussian Potentials on Quantum Walks for Spatial Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the impact of potential fields, particularly utilizing a bivariate Gaussian distribution function, on the dynamics of quantum walks in spatial search problems. Building on the Ambainis-Kempe-Rivosh (AKR) model for searching on a two-dimensional grid, we incorporate potential fields to investigate how changes in standard deviation and normalization of the bivariate Gaussian function impact the performance of the search algorithm. Our results show that the quantum walk closely mirrors the AKR algorithm when the standard deviation is small but exhibits a rapid decay in success probability as the standard deviation increases. This behavior demonstrates how the bivariate Gaussian can effectively model a noisy oracle within the AKR algorithm. Additionally, we compare the AKR-based model with an alternative quantum walk model using a Hadamard coin and standard shift. These findings contribute to understanding the robustness of quantum walk search algorithms, and provide insights into how quantum walks can be applied to optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum optical systems is determined by three key factors: the interactions with their surrounding environment, externally controlled lasers and between the different system components. Understanding the interplay between the three dynamical contributions is essential for the study of out-of-equilibrium phenomena as well as technological applications. The present study investigates open system phenomena in driven optical systems coupled simultaneously to a bosonic field. For a linear system of micro-cavities coupled to a photonic crystal, it is analytically shown that environmental interaction and external control cause significant non-Markovian corrections to the applied coherent drive. Additionally, collective cross-driving effects arise when multiple modes are coupled to the same field, where a laser applied to one mode effectively drives other modes. Based on the linear solution, a non-Markovian master equation for two-level emitters is derived. Remarkably, the proposed equation of motion remains accurate even for moderate driving intensities, where emitters cannot be approximated by bosonic modes. The influence of the non-linearity is analyzed and benchmarked against an exact pseudo-mode solution, and compared with established master equations in the Markovian regime. Within this regime, the comparison demonstrates the presence of short-time non-Markovian effects at times well beyond the inverse of the environment's bandwidth, and memory effects induced by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the driven open system dynamics of quantum optical systems, impurities embedded in solid-state materials, molecular systems, and more, paving the way for precise control of their quantum states.</description>

      <title>Quantum fractional revival governed by adjacency matrix Hamiltonian in unitary Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give characterization for existence of quantum fractional revival in unitary Cayley graph utilizing adjacency matrix Hamiltonian. Unitary Cayley graph $X=( Z_n, S)$ is a special graph as connection set $S \subseteq Z_n$ is the collection of coprimes to $n$. Unitary Cayley graph is an integral graph and its adjacency matrix is a circulant one. We prove that quantum fractional revival in unitary Cayley graphs exists only when the number of vertices is even. Number-theoretic and spectral characterizations are given for unitary Cayley graph admitting quantum fractional revival. Quantum fractional revival is analogous to quantum entanglement. It is one of qubit state transfer phenomena useful in communication of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of photonic entangled states using decoherence-free subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of collective states of matter as a resource for the deterministic generation of quantum states of light, which are fundamental for quantum information technologies. Our minimal model consists of three emitters coupled to a half-waveguide, i.e., a one-dimensional waveguide terminated by a mirror. Photon-mediated interactions between the emitters result in the emergence of bright and dark states. The dark states form a decoherence-free subspace, protected from dissipation. Local driving of the emitters and control of their resonance frequencies allows to perform arbitrary quantum gates within the decoherence-free subspace. Coupling to bright states facilitates photon emission, thereby enabling the realization of quantum gates between light and matter. We demonstrate that sequential application of these gates leads to the generation of photonic entangled states, such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and one- and two-dimensional cluster states.</description>

      <title>Efficient tomography of microwave photonic cluster states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement among a large number of qubits is a crucial resource for many quantum algorithms. Such many-body states have been efficiently generated by entangling a chain of itinerant photonic qubits in the optical or microwave domain. However, it has remained challenging to fully characterize the generated many-body states by experimentally reconstructing their exponentially large density matrices. Here, we develop an efficient tomography method based on the matrix-product-operator formalism and demonstrate it on a cluster state of up to 35 microwave photonic qubits by reconstructing its $2^{35} \times 2^{35}$ density matrix. The full characterization enables us to detect the performance degradation of our photon source which occurs only when generating a large cluster state. This tomography method is generally applicable to various physical realizations of entangled qubits and provides an efficient benchmarking method for guiding the development of high-fidelity sources of entangled photons.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separation Between Quantum Commitments and Quantum One-wayness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there exists a unitary quantum oracle relative to which quantum commitments exist but no (efficiently verifiable) one-way state generators exist. Both have been widely considered candidates for replacing one-way functions as the minimal assumption for cryptography: the weakest cryptographic assumption implied by all of computational cryptography. Recent work has shown that commitments can be constructed from one-way state generators, but the other direction has remained open. Our results rule out any black-box construction, and thus settle this crucial open problem, suggesting that quantum commitments (as well as its equivalency class of EFI pairs, quantum oblivious transfer, and secure quantum multiparty computation) appear to be strictly weakest among all known cryptographic primitives.</description>

      <title>Entangling power of spin-j systems: a geometrical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary gates with high entangling power are relevant for several quantum-enhanced technologies due to their entangling capabilities. For symmetric multiparticle systems, such as spin states or bosonic systems, the particle exchange symmetry restricts these gates and also the set of not-entangled states. In this work, we analyze the entangling power of spin systems by reformulating it as an inner product between vectors with components given by SU(2) invariants. This approach allows us to study this quantity for small-spin systems including the detection of the unitary gate that maximizes it for small spins. We observe that extremal unitary gates exhibit entanglement distributions with high rotational symmetry, same that are linked to a convex combination of Husimi functions of certain states. Furthermore, we explore the connection between entangling power and the Schmidt numbers admissible in some spin state subspaces. Thus, the geometrical approach presented here suggests new paths for studying entangling power linked to other concepts in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects in Ion Transport: A Thermodynamic Resource Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, understanding thermodynamics in the quantum regime has garnered significant attention, driven by advances in nanoscale physics and experimental techniques. In parallel, growing evidence supports the importance of quantum effects in various biological processes, making them increasingly relevant to quantum thermodynamics. In this study, we apply resource theory formulations of thermodynamics to investigate the role of quantum properties in ion transport across cell membranes. Within this framework, quantum properties are treated as resources under generalized thermodynamic constraints in the quantum regime. Specifically, our findings reveal that non-Markovianity, which reflects memory effects in ion transport dynamics, serves as a key quantum resource that enhances the yield and efficiency of the ion transport process. In contrast, quantum coherence, manifested as the superposition of energy states in ion-transport proteins, reduces these metrics but plays a crucial role in distinguishing between ion channels and ion pumps: two distinct types of ion-transport proteins in cell membranes. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing an additional coherent system allows coherence to facilitate the transformation of an ion pump into an ion channel.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit complexity for linearly polarised light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a form of quantum circuit complexity that extends to open systems. To illustrate our methodology, we focus on a basic model where the projective Hilbert space of states is depicted by the set of orientations in the Euclidean plane. Specifically, we investigate the dynamics of mixed quantum states as they undergo interactions with a sequence of gates. Our approach involves the analysis of sequences of real $2\times2$ density matrices. This mathematical model is physically exemplified by the Stokes density matrices, which delineate the linear polarisation of a quasi-monochromatic light beam, and the gates, which are viewed as quantum polarisers, whose states are also real $2\times2$ density matrices. The interaction between polariser-linearly polarised light is construed within the context of this quantum formalism. Each density matrix for the light evolves in an approach analogous to a Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) process during the time interval between consecutive gates. Notably, when considering an upper limit for the cost function or tolerance or accuracy, we unearth that the optimal number of gates follows a power-law relationship.</description>

      <title>A Simple Framework for Secure Key Leasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure key leasing (a.k.a. key-revocable cryptography) enables us to lease a cryptographic key as a quantum state in such a way that the key can be later revoked in a verifiable manner. We propose a simple framework for constructing cryptographic primitives with secure key leasing via the certified deletion property of BB84 states. Based on our framework, we obtain the following schemes.
  - A public key encryption scheme with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on any IND-CPA secure public key encryption scheme. Prior works rely on either quantum revocation or stronger assumptions such as the quantum hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem.
  - A pseudorandom function with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on one-way functions. Prior works rely on stronger assumptions such as the quantum hardness of the LWE problem.
  - A digital signature scheme with secure key leasing that has classical revocation based on the quantum hardness of the short integer solution (SIS) problem. Our construction has static signing keys, i.e., the state of a signing key almost does not change before and after signing. Prior constructions either rely on non-static signing keys or indistinguishability obfuscation to achieve a stronger goal of copy-protection.
  In addition, all of our schemes remain secure even if a verification key for revocation is leaked after the adversary submits a valid certificate of deletion. To our knowledge, all prior constructions are totally broken in this setting. Moreover, in our view, our security proofs are much simpler than those for existing schemes.</description>

      <title>A New World in the Depths of Microcrypt: Separating OWSGs and Quantum Money from QEFID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While in classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) are widely regarded as the "minimal assumption," the situation in quantum cryptography is less clear. Recent works have put forward two concurrent candidates for the minimal assumption in quantum cryptography: One-way state generators (OWSGs), postulating the existence of a hard search problem with an efficient verification algorithm, and EFI pairs, postulating the existence of a hard distinguishing problem. Two recent papers [Khurana and Tomer STOC'24; Batra and Jain FOCS'24] showed that OWSGs imply EFI pairs, but the reverse direction remained open. In this work, we give strong evidence that the opposite direction does not hold: We show that there is a quantum unitary oracle relative to which EFI pairs exist, but OWSGs do not. In fact, we show a slightly stronger statement that holds also for EFI pairs that output classical bits (QEFID). As a consequence, we separate, via our oracle, QEFID, and one-way puzzles from OWSGs and several other Microcrypt primitives, including efficiently verifiable one-way puzzles and unclonable state generators. In particular, this solves a problem left open in [Chung, Goldin, and Gray Crypto'24]. Using similar techniques, we also establish a fully black-box separation (which is slightly weaker than an oracle separation) between private-key quantum money schemes and QEFID pairs. One conceptual implication of our work is that the existence of an efficient verification algorithm may lead to qualitatively stronger primitives in quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>A deterministic and efficient source of frequency-polarization hyper-encoded photonic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency or color of photons is an attractive degree of freedom to encode and distribute the quantum information over long distances. However, the generation of frequency-encoded photonic qubits has so far relied on probabilistic non-linear single-photon sources and inefficient gates. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of photonic qubits hyper-encoded in frequency and polarization based on a semiconductor quantum dot in a cavity. We exploit the double dipole structure of a neutral exciton and demonstrate the generation of any quantum superposition in amplitude and phase, controlled by the polarization of the pump laser pulse. The source generates frequency-polarization single-photon qubits at a rate of 4 MHz corresponding to a generation probability at the first lens of 28 $\pm$ 2%, with a photon number purity &gt; 98%. The photons show an indistinguishability &gt; 91% for each dipole and 88% for a balanced quantum superposition of both. The density matrix of the hyper-encoded photonic state is measured by time-resolved polarization tomography, evidencing a fidelity to the target state of 94 $\pm$ 8% and concurrence of 77 $\pm$ 2%, here limited by frequency overlap in our device. Our approach brings the advantages of quantum dot sources to the field of quantum information processing based on frequency encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop an open quantum system view of the parametric approximation, which allows us to obtain systematic perturbative corrections to it. We consider the Jaynes-Cummings model with dissipation, assuming that the field is in the regime close to the parametric approximation with depletion. We obtain non-unitary corrections to the parametric approximation and additional dynamical Lamb-shift contributions to it. For high detuning, these non-unitary corrections appear to be non-Markovian before depletion. And we show that even after depletion, initial non-Markovian behaviour contributes to the dynamics via laser-induced polishing of the density matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a general family of quantum codes that protect against all emission, absorption, dephasing, and raising/lowering errors up to an arbitrary fixed order. Such codes are known in the literature as absorption-emission (AE) codes. We derive simplified error correction conditions for a general AE code and show that any permutation-invariant code that corrects $\le t$ errors can be mapped to an AE code that corrects up to order-$t$ transitions. Carefully tuning the parameters of permutationally invariant codes, we construct several examples of efficient AE codes, hosted in systems with low total angular momentum. Our results also imply that spin codes can be mapped to AE codes, enabling us to characterize logical operators for certain subclasses of such codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks are a compressed format for multi-dimensional data. One-dimensional tensor networks -- often referred to as tensor trains (TT) or matrix product states (MPS) -- are increasingly being used as a numerical ansatz for continuum functions by "quantizing" the inputs into discrete binary digits. Here we demonstrate the power of more general tree tensor networks for this purpose. We provide direct constructions of a number of elementary functions as generic tree tensor networks and interpolative constructions for more complicated functions via a generalization of the tensor cross interpolation algorithm. For a range of multi-dimensional functions we show how more structured tree tensor networks offer a significantly more efficient ansatz than the commonly used tensor train. We demonstrate an application of our methods to solving multi-dimensional, non-linear Fredholm equations, providing a rigorous bound on the rank of the solution which, in turn, guarantees exponentially scaling accuracy with the size of the tree tensor network for certain problems.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of quantum trajectories in dissipative Landau-Zener model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present statistics of quantum jumps in the two-level system with landau-Zener Hamiltonian that undergoes a Markovian process. For the Landau-Zener model, which is successful in simulating adiabatic/non-adiabatic evolution and quantum annealing, we consider two types of dissipation. In the first one, the jump operators project states to the initial ground state and excited state of the Hamiltonian at $t\to -\infty$. In the second type, the jump operators project to the instantaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. By the quantum trajectories approach, we present the probability of the number of jumps in adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes for both models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the statistics of jumps in time intervals of the evolutions. Also, we show the role of bath temperature, coupling strength to the environment, and spin-coupling directions on the statistics of quantum jumps.</description>

      <title>Programmable time-frequency mode-sorting of single photons with a multi-output quantum pulse gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-dimensional mode-sorter for single photons based on a multi-output quantum pulse gate, which we can program to switch between different temporal-mode encodings including pulse modes, frequency bins, time bins, and their superpositions. This device can facilitate practical realizations of quantum information applications such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution, and thus enables secure communication with enhanced information capacity. We characterize the mode-sorter through a detector tomography in 3 and 5 dimensions and find a fidelity up to $0.958\pm 0.030$ at the single-photon level.</description>

      <title>Universal adapters between quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the repetition code adapter as a way to perform joint logical Pauli measurements within a quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codeblock or between separate such codeblocks. This adapter is universal in the sense that it works regardless of the LDPC codes involved and the Paulis being measured. The construction achieves joint logical Pauli measurement of $t$ weight $O(d)$ operators using $O(td\log^2d)$ additional qubits and checks and $O(d)$ time. We also show for some geometrically-local codes in fixed $D\ge2$ dimensions that only $O(td)$ additional qubits and checks are required instead. By extending the adapter in the case $t=2$, we construct a toric code adapter that uses $O(d^2)$ additional qubits and checks to perform targeted logical CNOT gates on arbitrary LDPC codes via Dehn twists. To obtain some of these results, we develop a novel weaker form of graph edge expansion.</description>

      <title>A local photon perspective on the momentum of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we introduced a local photon approach for modelling the quantised electromagnetic field in position space. Using this approach, in this paper we define the momentum of light, in analogy to the momentum of quantum mechanical point particles, as the generator for the spatial translation of photonic wave packets. Afterwards, we analyse the momentum dynamics of light when transitioning from air into a denser dielectric medium. Our analysis shines new light onto the Abraham-Minkowski controversy which highlights the intricacies involved in the characterisation of the momentum of the electromagnetic field. Although our results align with Minkowski's theory and with the definition of the canonical momentum of light in quantum electrodynamics, there are also some crucial differences.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel quantum spin-glass model, a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a transverse mean-field type random magnet. We rigorously derive the exact expression of the free energy of this model at the entire parameter region. The obtained exact solution implies the existence of a 1RSB-fullRSB transition at low temperatures. Our technique can be applied to general classical spin models, telling that any solvable classical spin model has its solvable quantum counterpart.</description>

      <title>Foundational Issues in Dynamical Casimir Effect and Analogue Features in Cosmological Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving mirrors as analogue sources of Hawking radiation from black holes have been explored extensively, less so with cosmological particle creation (CPC), even though the analogy between dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) and CPC based on the mechanism of parametric amplification of quantum field fluctuations has also been known for a long time. This `perspective' essay intends to convey some of the rigor and thoroughness of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, which serves as the theoretical foundation of CPC, to DCE, which enjoys a variety of active experimental explorations. We have selected out seven issues of relevance to address, starting from the naively simple ones, e.g., why should one be bothered with `curved' spacetime when performing a laboratory experiment in ostensibly flat space, to foundational theoretical ones, such as the frequent appearance of nonlocal dissipation in the system dynamics induced by colored noises in its field environment, the existence of quantum Lenz law and fluctuation-dissipation relations in the backreaction effects of DCE emission on the moving atom/mirror or the source, and the construction of a microphysics model to account for the dynamical responses of a mirror or medium. The strengthening of theoretical ground for DCE is useful not only for improving conceptual clarity but needed for the development of proof of concept type of future experimental designs for DCE. Results from DCE experiments in turn will enrich our understanding of quantum field effects in the early universe because they are, in the spirit of analogue gravity, our best hopes for the verification of these fundamental processes.</description>

      <title>Confinement and false vacuum decay on the Potts quantum spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that in the former case, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. In the latter case, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, pointing to a hitherto unknown shortcoming of the membrane picture in describing such systems.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD with Complex-Valued Orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and coupled cluster theory restricted to paired double excitations (pCCD) are emerging as efficient methodologies for accounting for the so-called non-dynamic electronic correlation effects. Up to now, molecular calculations have been performed with real-valued orbitals. However, before extending the applicability of these methodologies to extended systems, where Bloch states are employed, the subtleties of working with complex-valued orbitals and the consequences of imposing time-reversal symmetry must be carefully addressed. In this work, we describe the theoretical and practical implications of adopting time-reversal symmetry in RDMFT and pCCD when allowing for complex-valued orbital coefficients. The theoretical considerations primarily affect the optimization algorithms, while the practical implications raise fundamental questions about the stability of solutions. Specifically, we find that complex solutions lower the energy when non-dynamic electronic correlation effects are pronounced. We present numerical examples to illustrate and discuss these instabilities and possible problems introduced by N-representability violations.</description>

      <title>Combined Dissipative and Hamiltonian Confinement of Cat Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05545v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction with biased-noise qubits can drastically reduce the hardware overhead for universal and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Cat qubits are a promising realization of biased-noise qubits as they feature an exponential error bias inherited from their non-local encoding in the phase space of a quantum harmonic oscillator. To confine the state of an oscillator to the cat qubit manifold, two main approaches have been considered so far: a Kerr-based Hamiltonian confinement with high gate performances, and a dissipative confinement with robust protection against a broad range of noise mechanisms. We introduce a new combined dissipative and Hamiltonian confinement scheme based on two-photon dissipation together with a Two-Photon Exchange (TPE) Hamiltonian. The TPE Hamiltonian is similar to Kerr nonlinearity, but unlike the Kerr it only induces a bounded distinction between even- and odd-photon eigenstates, a highly beneficial feature for protecting the cat qubits with dissipative mechanisms. Using this combined confinement scheme, we demonstrate fast and bias-preserving gates with drastically improved performance compared to dissipative or Hamiltonian schemes. In addition, this combined scheme can be implemented experimentally with only minor modifications of existing dissipative cat qubit experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the theory of quantum channels and open-system state evolution to propose a unitary parameterization and an efficient learning algorithm for Quantum Hidden Markov Models (QHMMs). By leveraging the richer dynamics of quantum channels, we demonstrate the greater efficiency of quantum stochastic generators compared to classical ones. Specifically, we prove that a stochastic process can be simulated within a quantum Hilbert space using quadratically fewer dimensions than in a classical stochastic vector space. We show that any QHMM can be efficiently implemented and simulated using a quantum circuit with mid-circuit measurements. A key advantage for feasible QHMM learning in the hypothesis space of unitary circuits lies in the continuity of Stinespring's dilation. Specifically, if the unitary parameterizations of channels are close in the operator norm, the corresponding channels will be close in both diamond norm and Bures distance. This property forms the foundation for defining of efficient learning algorithms with continuous fitness landscapes. By employing the unitary parameterization of QHMMs, we establish a formal generative learning model. This model formalizes the empirical distributions of target stochastic process languages, defines the hypothesis space of quantum circuits, and introduces an empirical stochastic divergence measure-hypothesis fitness-as a criterion for learning success. The smooth mapping between the hypothesis and fitness spaces facilitates the development of efficient heuristic and gradient descent algorithms. We consider four examples of stochastic process languages and train QHMMs with hyperparameter-adaptive evolutionary search and multi-parameter nonlinear optimization technique applied to parameterized quantum ansatz circuits. We confirm our results by running optimal circuits on quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems and the second law of thermodynamics are powerful relations constraining the behavior of out-of-equilibrium systems. While there exist generalizations of these relations to feedback controlled quantum systems, their applicability is limited, in particular when considering strong and continuous measurements. In this letter, we overcome this shortcoming by deriving a novel fluctuation theorem, and the associated second law of information thermodynamics, which remain applicable in arbitrary feedback control scenarios. In our second law, the entropy production is bounded by the coarse-grained entropy production which is inferrable from the measurement outcomes, an experimentally accessible quantity that does not diverge even under strong continuous measurements. We illustrate our results by a qubit undergoing discrete and continuous measurement, where our approach provides a useful bound on the entropy production for all measurement strengths.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the natural connection between quantum walks and electrical networks by considering Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop the multidimensional electrical network by defining Kirchhoff's Alternative Law and Ohm's Alternative Law based on the novel multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. This multidimensional electrical network allows us to sample from the electrical flow obtained via a multidimensional quantum walk algorithm and achieve exponential quantum-classical separations for certain graph problems.
  We first use this framework to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the well known exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree problem by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis. Furthermore, by constructing a $3$-regular graph based on welded trees, this framework also allows us to show an exponential speedup for the pathfinding problem. This solves one of the open problems by Li [arXiv '23], where they construct a non-regular graph and use the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.
  In analogy to the connection between the (edge-vertex) incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we also rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Kirchhoff's Alternative Law and Ohm's Alternative Law. By establishing this connection, we expect that the multidimensional electrical network could have more applications beyond quantum walks.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the gap that limits the speed of a quantum annealing process can take three salient morphologies: (i) the supersteep gap where both the ground and the first excited eigenenergy level curves have topologically related pairs of nearby inflection points giving both the maximum and the minimum a steep aspect, (ii) the steep gap where only the first excited eigenenergy level curve has a pair of inflection points giving its minimum a steep aspect while the maximum of the ground level does not exhibit inflection points, and (iii) the mild gap that has no related inflection points. Classification of the various singularities betrayed by the inflection points relies on the critical value curves of the quadratic numerical range mapping of the matrix H0+iH1, where H0 is the transverse field Hamiltonian and H1 the problem Hamiltonian. It is shown that the ground level is mapped to the generically smooth boundary of the numerical range, while the first excited level is mapped to an interior non-smooth critical value curve exhibiting swallow tails. The major result is that the position of the swallow tails relative to the boundary allows the supersteep versus steep discrimination, while the absence of swallow tail-boundary interaction characterizes the mild gap. As a corollary of the singularity analysis, the highly structured initial and final Hamiltonians of the Grover search create unstable singularities that break into stable swallow tails under perturbation, with the consequence of invalidating the gap scaling estimates computed around the unstable singularity. Classification of all stable singularities from a global viewpoint requires the Legendrian approach where the energy level curves become Legendrian knots in the contact space. Last but not least, it will be shown that a supersteep swallow tail previews tunneling.</description>

      <title>J-coupling NMR Spectroscopy with Nitrogen Vacancy Centers at High Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diamond-based sensor utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles permits the analysis of micron-sized samples through NMR techniques at room temperature. Current efforts are directed towards extending the operating range of NV centers into high magnetic fields, driven by the potential for larger nuclear spin polarization of the target sample and the presence of enhanced chemical shifts. Especially interesting is the access to J-couplings as they carry information of chemical connectivity inside molecules. In this work, we present a protocol to access J-couplings in both homonuclear and heteronuclear cases with NV centers at high magnetic fields. Our protocol leads to a clear spectrum exclusively containing J-coupling features with high resolution. This resolution is limited primarily by the decoherence of the target sample, which is mitigated by the noise filtering capacities of our method.</description>

      <title>Characterization of entanglement on superconducting quantum computers of up to 414 qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum technology advances and the size of quantum computers grow, it becomes increasingly important to understand the extent of quality in the devices. As large-scale entanglement is a quantum resource crucial for achieving quantum advantage, the challenge in its generation makes it a valuable benchmark for measuring the performance of universal quantum devices. In this work, we study entanglement in Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and graph states prepared on the range of IBM Quantum devices. We generate GHZ states and investigate their coherence times with respect to state size and dynamical decoupling techniques. A GHZ fidelity of $0.519 \pm 0.014$ is measured on a 32-qubit GHZ state, certifying its genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). We show a substantial improvement in GHZ decoherence rates for a 7-qubit GHZ state after implementing dynamical decoupling, and observe a linear trend in the decoherence rate of $\alpha=(7.13N+5.54)10^{-3}\mu s^{-1}$ for up to $N=15$ qubits, confirming the absence of superdecoherence. Additionally, we prepare and characterize fully bipartite entangled native graph states on 22 superconducting quantum devices with qubit counts as high as 414 qubits, all active qubits of the 433-qubit IBM Osprey device. Analysis of the decay of 2-qubit entanglement within the prepared states shows suppression of coherent noise signals with the implementation of dynamical decoupling techniques. Additionally, we observe that the entanglement in some qubit pairs oscillates over time, which is likely caused by residual ZZ-interactions. Characterizing entanglement in native graph states, along with detecting entanglement oscillations, can be an effective approach to low-level device benchmarking that encapsulates 2-qubit error rates along with additional sources of noise, with possible applications to quantum circuit compilation.</description>

      <title>Genuine entanglement detection via projection map in multipartite systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism to detect genuine multipartite entanglement by considering projection map which is a positive but not completely positive map. Projection map has been motivated by the no-pancake theorem which repudiates the existence of a quantum operation that maps the Bloch sphere onto a disk along its equator. The not complete positivity feature of projection map is explored to investigate genuine multipartite entanglement in arbitrary N-qubit quantum systems. Our proposed framework can detect some important classes of genuinely entangled states in tripartite and quadripartite scenarios. We provide illustrative example to show the efficacy of our formalism to detect a class of tripartite PPT bound entangled states. Finally, we construct a suitable witness operator based on projection map to certify genuine tripartite entanglement, which is likely to be feasible experimentally.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with key rates far above the PLOB bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) at large distances has such high noise levels that the error-correcting code must have very low rate. In this regime it becomes feasible to implement random-codebook error correction, which is known to perform close to capacity. We propose a reverse reconciliation scheme for CVQKD in which the first step is advantage distillation based on random-codebook error correction operated above the Shannon limit. Our scheme has a novel way of achieving statistical decoupling between the public reconciliation data and the secret key. We provide an analysis of the secret key rate for the case of Gaussian collective attacks, and we present numerical results. The best performance is obtained when the message size exceeds the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ between Alice's quadratures $X$ and Bob's measurements $Y$, i.e. the Shannon limit. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is understood from a tradeoff between code rate and frame rejection rate, combined with the fact that error correction for QKD needs to reconcile only random data. We obtain secret key rates that lie far above the Devetak-Winter value $I(X;Y) - I(E;Y)$, which is the upper bound in the case of one-way error correction. Furthermore, our key rates lie above the PLOB bound for Continuous-Variable detection, but below the PLOB bound for Discrete-Variable detection.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading of Conditional Mutual Information in Noisy Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of conditional mutual information in generic open quantum systems, focusing on one-dimensional random circuits with interspersed local noise. Unlike in noiseless circuits, where conditional mutual information spreads linearly while being bounded by the lightcone, we find that noisy random circuits with an error rate $p$ exhibit superlinear propagation of conditional mutual information, which diverges far beyond the lightcone at a critical circuit depth $t_c \propto p^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the underlying mechanism for such rapid spreading is the combined effect of local noise and a scrambling unitary, which selectively removes short-range correlations while preserving long-range correlations. To analytically capture the dynamics of conditional mutual information in noisy random circuits, we introduce a coarse-graining method, and we validate our theoretical results through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we identify a universal scaling law governing the spreading of conditional mutual information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect from the perspective of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics by studying relaxation dynamics of quantum systems coupled to a Markovian heat bath, which are described by Davies maps. Starting from a state with coherences in the energy eigenbasis, we demonstrate that an exponential speedup to equilibrium will always occur if the state is transformed to a diagonal state in the energy eigenbasis, provided that the spectral gap of the generator is defined by a complex eigenvalue. When the transformed state has a higher nonequilibrium free energy, we argue using thermodynamic reasoning that this is a \textit{genuine} quantum Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we show how a unitary transformation on an initial state can always be constructed to yield the effect and demonstrate our findings by studying the dynamics of both the non-equilibrium free energy and the irreversible entropy production in single and multi-qubit examples.</description>

Abstract: With recent experimental advancements demonstrating high-fidelity universal logic gates and basic programmability, Silicon-based spin quantum bit (qubit) have emerged as promising candidates for scalable quantum computing. However, implementation of more complex quantum information protocols with many qubits still remains a critical challenge for realization of practical programmability in Silicon devices. In this study, we present a computational investigation of entanglement-based quantum information applications implemented on an electrically defined quantum dot structure in Silicon. Using in-house multi-scale simulations based on tight-binding calculations augmented with bulk physics, we model a five quantum dot system that can create up to five electron spin qubits, and discuss details of control engineering needed to implement single-qubit rotations and two-qubit logic operations in a programmable manner. Using these elementary operations, then, we design a five-qubit quantum teleportation protocol and computationally verify its end-to-end operation including a simple but clear analysis on how the designed circuit can be affected by charge noise. With engineering details that are not well uncovered by experiments, our results demonstrate the advanced programmability of Silicon quantum dot systems, delivering the practical guidelines for potential designs of quantum information processes based on electrically defined Silicon quantum dot structures.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in Fluxonium Qubits from Coherent Quantum Phase Slips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase slips occur across all Josephson junctions (JJs) at a rate that increases with the impedance of the junction. In superconducting qubits composed of JJ-array superinductors -- such as fluxonium -- phase slips in the array can lead to decoherence. In particular, phase-slip processes at the individual array junctions can coherently interfere, each with an Aharonov--Casher phase that depends on the offset charges of the array islands. These coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) perturbatively modify the qubit frequency, and therefore charge noise on the array islands will lead to dephasing. By varying the impedance of the array junctions, we design a set of fluxonium qubits in which the expected phase-slip rate within the JJ-array changes by several orders of magnitude. We characterize the coherence times of these qubits and demonstrate that the scaling of CQPS-induced dephasing rates agrees with our theoretical model. Furthermore, we perform noise spectroscopy of two qubits in regimes dominated by either CQPS or flux noise. We find the noise power spectrum associated with CQPS dephasing appears to be featureless at low frequencies and not $1/f$. Numerical simulations indicate this behavior is consistent with charge noise generated by charge-parity fluctuations within the array. Our findings broadly inform JJ-array-design tradeoffs, relevant for the numerous superconducting qubit designs employing JJ-array superinductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve Initial Value Problems with the Implicit Crank-Nicolson and the Method of Lines (MoL) evolution schemes. The unknown functions use a spectral decomposition with the Fourier basis. The examples developed to illustrate the implementation are the Advection equation, the wave equation written as a system of first order coupled equations and the viscous Burgers equation as a non-linear case. The problems are solved using: i) standard Finite Differences as the solution to compare with, ii) the State Vector Formalism (SVF), and iii) the Sampling Error Formalism (SEF). The contributions of this paper include: 1) cost functions for generic first order in time PDEs using the implicit Crank-Nicholson and the MoL, 2) detailed convergence or self-convergence tests are presented for all the equations solved, 3) a system of three coupled PDEs is solved, 4) solutions using sampling error are presented, which highlights the importance of simulating the sampling process and 5) a fast version of the SVF and SEF was developed which can be used to test different optimizers faster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show in this paper that a strong and easy connection exists between quantum error correction and Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) by using the Gauge symmetry to construct an efficient error-correcting code for Abelian LGTs. We identify the logical operations on this gauge covariant code and show that the corresponding Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of these logical operations while preserving the locality of the interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these substitutions actually give a new way of writing the LGT as an equivalent hardcore boson model. Finally we demonstrate a method to perform fault-tolerant time evolution of the Hamiltonian within the gauge covariant code using both product formulas and qubitization approaches. This opens up the possibility of inexpensive end to end dynamical simulations that save physical qubits by blurring the lines between simulation algorithms and quantum error correcting codes.</description>

Abstract: Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs) are extensively employed in experiments involving weak microwave signals for their highly desirable quantum-limited and broadband characteristics. However, TWPAs' broadband nature comes with the disadvantage of admitting the activation of spurious nonlinear processes, such as harmonics generation, that can potentially degrade amplification performance. Here we experimentally investigate a Josephson TWPA device with SNAIL (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive Element)-based unit cells focusing on the amplification behaviour along with the generation of second and third harmonics of the pump. By comparing experimental results with transient numerical simulations, we demonstrate the influence of Josephson junctions' fabrication imperfections on the occurrence of harmonics and on the gain behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are crucial ingredients in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While there have been rapid experimental progresses in realizing MCMs, a systematic method for characterizing noisy MCMs is still under exploration. In this work we develop a cycle benchmarking (CB)-type algorithm to characterize noisy MCMs. The key idea is to use a joint Fourier transform on the classical and quantum registers and then estimate parameters in the Fourier space, analogous to Pauli fidelities used in CB-type algorithms for characterizing the Pauli noise channel of Clifford gates. Furthermore, we develop a theory of the noise learnability of MCMs, which determines what information can be learned about the noise model (in the presence of state preparation and terminating measurement (SPAM) noise) and what cannot, which shows that all learnable information can be learned using our algorithm. As an application, we show how to use the learned information to test the independence between measurement noise and state preparation noise in an MCM. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the practical applicability of the algorithm. Similar to other CB-type algorithms, we expect the algorithm to provide a useful toolkit that is of experimental interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite acute interest in the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems, there is a lack of consensus in the mathematical formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the community. Different methodologies are used in the literature to study non-Hermitian dynamics. This ranges from consistent frameworks like biorthogonal quantum mechanics and metric approach characterized by modified inner products, to normalization by time-dependent norms inspired by open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically explore the similarities and differences among these various methods. Utilizing illustrative models with exact solutions, we demonstrate that these methods produce not only quantitatively different results but also distinct physical interpretations. For dissipative systems where non-Hermiticity arises as an approximation, we find that the normalization method in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime closely aligns with the full master equation solutions. In contrast, for quantum systems where non-Hermiticity can be engineered exactly, incorporating metric dynamics is crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, necessitating the generalization of unitary symmetry to non-Hermitian systems. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, potentially leveraging generalized symmetries for novel physical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) combines digital gates with analog operations, offering an alternative paradigm for universal quantum computation. This approach leverages the higher fidelities of analog operations and the flexibility of local single-qubit gates. In this paper, we propose a quantum genetic algorithm within the DAQC framework using a Rydberg-atom emulator. The algorithm employs single-qubit operations in the digital domain and a global driving interaction based on the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog domain. We evaluate the algorithm performance by estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians, with a focus on molecules such as $\rm H_2$, $\rm LiH$, and $\rm BeH_2$. Our results show energy estimations with less than 1% error and state overlaps nearing 1, with computation times ranging from a few minutes for $\rm H_2$ (2-qubit circuits) to one to two days for $\rm LiH$ and $\rm BeH_2$ (6-qubit circuits). The gate fidelities of global analog operations further underscore DAQC as a promising quantum computing strategy in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

Abstract: Quantum signal processing and quantum singular value transformation are powerful tools to implement polynomial transformations of block-encoded matrices on quantum computers, and has achieved asymptotically optimal complexity in many prominent quantum algorithms. We propose a framework of quantum signal processing and quantum singular value transformation on $U(N)$, which realizes multiple polynomials simultaneously from a block-encoded input, as a generalization of those on $U(2)$ in the original frameworks. We also perform a comprehensive analysis on achievable polynomials and give a recursive algorithm to construct the quantum circuit that gives the desired polynomial transformation. As two example applications, we propose a framework to realize bi-variate polynomial functions, and study the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm with asymptotically optimal query complexity.</description>

Abstract: Classical neural networks with random initialization famously behave as Gaussian processes in the limit of many neurons, which allows one to completely characterize their training and generalization behavior. No such general understanding exists for quantum neural networks (QNNs), which -- outside of certain special cases -- are known to not behave as Gaussian processes when randomly initialized. We here prove that QNNs and their first two derivatives instead generally form what we call "Wishart processes," where certain algebraic properties of the network determine the hyperparameters of the process. This Wishart process description allows us to, for the first time: give necessary and sufficient conditions for a QNN architecture to have a Gaussian process limit; calculate the full gradient distribution, generalizing previously known barren plateau results; and calculate the local minima distribution of algebraically constrained QNNs. Our unified framework suggests a certain simple operational definition for the "trainability" of a given QNN model using a newly introduced, experimentally accessible quantity we call the "degrees of freedom" of the network architecture.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-based continuous attacks on quantum key distribution protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most important characteristic of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol is its security against third-party attacks, and the potential countermeasures available. While new types of attacks are regularly developed in the literature, they rarely involve the use of weak continuous measurement. Here, we design a new attack scheme called $\textit{Deep-learning-based continuous attack}$ (DLCA) that exploits continuous measurement together with the powerful pattern recognition capacities of deep recurrent neural networks. We show that, when applied to the BB84 protocol, our attack can be difficult to notice while still allowing the spy to extract significant information about the states of the qubits sent in the quantum communication channel. Finally, we study how the spy can exploit quantum feedback to further cover their tracks. Our attack scheme, while still at the early stages of a toy model, constitutes a potential threat which is worthwhile to be investigated, also as it could be applied to different QKD protocols and generalized in many different ways.</description>

      <title>Continuity bounds for quantum entropies arising from a fundamental entropic inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a tight upper bound for the difference in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\rho_1 - \rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known Audenaert-Fannes (AF) inequality. In fact, it also leads to a refinement of the AF inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Our proofs are largely based on majorization theory and convex optimization. Interestingly, the fundamental entropic inequality is also valid in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experiment implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization fails to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is analytically proved, under a reasonable conjecture, by a new perturbation theory for unitary operators. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing discrete time crystals realized by kicking disordered systems, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Local Measurement Scheme of Gravitational Curvature using Atom Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light pulse atom interferometers (AIFs) are exquisite quantum probes of spatial inhomogeneity and gravitational curvature. Moreover, detailed measurement and calibration are necessary prerequisites for very-long-baseline atom interferometry (VLBAI). Here we present a method in which the differential signal of two co-located interferometers singles out a phase shift proportional to the curvature of the gravitational potential. The scale factor depends only on well controlled quantities, namely the photon wave number, the interferometer time and the atomic recoil, which allows the curvature to be accurately inferred from a measured phase. As a case study, we numerically simulate such a co-located gradiometric interferometer in the context of the Hannover VLBAI facility and prove the robustness of the phase shift in gravitational fields with complex spatial dependence. We define an estimator of the gravitational curvature for non-trivial gravitational fields and calculate the trade-off between signal strength and estimation accuracy with regard to spatial resolution. As a perspective, we discuss the case of a time-dependent gravitational field and corresponding measurement strategies.</description>

Abstract: We present a deterministic protocol for the preparation of arbitrary entangled states in the symmetric Dicke subspace of $N$ spins coupled to a common cavity mode. By combining a new geometric phase gate, an analytic solution of the noisy quantum channel dynamics and optimal control methods, the protocol prepares entangled states that are useful for quantum sensing, achieving a precision significantly better than the standard quantum limit in the presence of photon cavity loss, spontaneous emission and dephasing. This work opens the way to entanglement-enhanced sensing with cold trapped atoms in cavities and is also directly relevant for experiments with trapped ions.</description>

Abstract: A successful Machine Learning (ML) model implementation requires three main components: training dataset, suitable model architecture and training procedure. Given dataset and task, finding an appropriate model might be challenging. AutoML, a branch of ML, focuses on automatic architecture search -- a meta method that aims at moving human from ML system design process. The success of ML and the development of quantum computing (QC) in recent years led to a birth of new fascinating field called Quantum Machine Learning (QML) that, amongst others, incorporates quantum computers into ML models. In this paper we present AQMLator, an Auto Quantum Machine Learning platform that aims to automatically propose and train the quantum layers of an ML model with minimal input from the user. This way, data scientists can bypass the entry barrier for QC and use QML. AQMLator uses standard ML libraries, making it easy to introduce into existing ML pipelines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03824v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate that the novel general theory of relativity, named `Entangled Relativity', is more economical than General Relativity in terms of universal dimensionful constants when both theories are considered through a path integral formulation. The sole parameter of Entangled Relativity is a quantum of energy squared. However, in order to recover standard Quantum Field Theory when gravity is neglected in the path integral, we show that this quantum of energy corresponds to the reduced Planck energy. But this result also implies that Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and Newton's constant $G$ are not fixed constants in this framework but vary proportionally to a gravitational scalar degree of freedom, akin to typical scalar-tensor and $f(R)$ theories. In particular, it is derived that $\hbar$ is proportional to $G$ in this framework. This establishes an explicit connection between the quantum and gravitational realms. Given the absence of a free parameter in the theory, we argue that this unique prediction can likely be probed observationally in the future. Furthermore, due to the deficit of dimensionful parameters in Entangled Relativity compared to standard physics, fundamental length or time scales cannot be defined within this framework. We argue that this aspect is expected to become significant in the non-perturbative quantum gravity regime of the theory.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Virial Expansion for the Optical Response of Doped Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum virial expansion for the optical response of a doped two-dimensional semiconductor. As we show, this constitutes a perturbatively exact theory in the high-temperature or low-doping regime, where the electrons' thermal wavelength is smaller than their interparticle spacing. The virial expansion predicts new features of the photoluminescence, such as a non-trivial shape of the attractive branch related to universal low-energy exciton-electron scattering and an associated shift of the attractive peak from the trion energy. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped monolayer MoSe$_2$ [Zipfel et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 075311 (2022)] and they imply that the trion binding energy is likely to have been overestimated in previous measurements. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify two distinct theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, with the conventional trion picture results emerging as a high-temperature and weak-interaction limit of Fermi polaron theory.</description>

      <title>Efficient Finite Initialization for Tensorized Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for initializing layers of tensorized neural networks in a way that avoids the explosion of the parameters of the matrix it emulates. The method is intended for layers with a high number of nodes in which there is a connection to the input or output of all or most of the nodes, we cannot or do not want to store/calculate all the elements of the represented layer and they follow a smooth distribution. This method is equally applicable to normalize general tensor networks in which we want to avoid overflows.
  The core of this method is the use of the Frobenius norm and the partial lineal entrywise norm of reduced forms of the layer in an iterative partial form, so that it has to be finite and within a certain range. These norms are efficient to compute, fully or partially for most cases of interest. In addition, the method benefits from the reuse of intermediate calculations. We apply the method to different layers and check its performance. We create a Python function to run it on an arbitrary layer, available in a Jupyter Notebook in the i3BQuantum repository: https://github.com/i3BQuantumTeam/Q4Real/blob/e07c827651ef16bcf74590ab965ea3985143f891/Quantum-Inspired%20Variational%20Methods/TN_Normalizer.ipynb</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

Abstract: The contraction of tensor networks is a central task in the application of tensor network methods to the study of quantum and classical many body systems. In this paper, we investigate the impact of gauge degrees of freedom in the virtual indices of the tensor network on the contraction process, specifically focusing on boundary matrix product state methods for contracting two-dimensional tensor networks. We show that the gauge transformation can affect the entanglement structures of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix and change how the physical information is encoded in the eigenstates, which can influence the accuracy of the numerical simulation. We demonstrate this effect by looking at two different examples. First, we focus on the local gauge transformation, and analyze its effect by viewing it as an imaginary-time evolution governed by a diagonal Hamiltonian. As a specific example, we perform a numerical analysis in the classical Ising model on the square lattice. Second, we go beyond the scope of local gauge transformations and study the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the triangular lattice. The partition function of this model has two tensor network representations connected by a non-local gauge transformation, resulting in distinct numerical performances in the boundary MPS calculation.</description>

      <title>Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-N\'eel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p&lt;4$, only bound states with $n&gt;p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.</description>

      <title>A fixed phase tunable directional coupler based on coupling tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of photonic integrated circuits has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a growing demand for devices that offer high-performance reconfigurability. Due to the inability of conventional tunable directional couplers (TDCs) to maintain a fixed phase while tuning the reflectivity, Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) are employed as the primary building blocks for reflectivity tuning in constructing large-scale circuits. However, MZIs are prone to fabrication errors due to the need for perfect balanced directional couplers to achieve 0-1 reflectivity, which hinders their scalability. In this study, we introduce a design of a TDC based on coupling constant tuning in the thin film Lithium Niobate platform and present an optimized design. Our optimized TDC design enables arbitrary reflectivity tuning while ensuring a consistent phase across a wide range of operating wavelengths. Furthermore, it exhibits fewer bending sections than MZIs and is inherently resilient to fabrication errors in waveguide geometry and coupling length compared to both MZIs and conventional TDCs. Our work contributes to developing high-performance photonic integrated circuits with implications for various fields, including optical communication systems and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in conformal field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Landauer's principle and black hole area quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently in the saturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>
