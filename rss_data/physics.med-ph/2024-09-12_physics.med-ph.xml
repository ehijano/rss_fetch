      <title>1D Thermoembolization Model Using CT Imaging Data for Porcine Liver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Innovative therapies such as thermoembolization are expected to play an important role in improvising care for patients with diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Thermoembolization is a minimally invasive strategy that combines thermal ablation and embolization in a single procedure. This approach exploits an exothermic chemical reaction that occurs when an acid chloride is delivered via an endovascular route. However, comprehension of the complexities of the biophysics of thermoembolization is challenging. Mathematical models can aid in understanding such complex processes and assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. In this study, we used a Hagen Poiseuille 1D blood flow model to predict the mass transport and possible embolization locations in a porcine hepatic artery.
  Method: The 1D flow model was used on in vivo embolization imaging data of three pigs. The hydrolysis time constant of acid chloride chemical reaction was optimized for each pig, and LOOCV method was used to test the model's predictive ability.
  Conclusion: This basic model provided a balanced accuracy rate of 66.8% for identifying the possible locations of embolization in the hepatic artery. Use of the model provides an initial understanding of the vascular transport phenomena that are predicted to occur as a result of thermoembolization.</description>

      <title>Jump stochastic differential equations for the characterisation of the Bragg peak in proton beam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton beam radiotherapy stands at the forefront of precision cancer treatment, leveraging the unique physical interactions of proton beams with human tissue to deliver minimal dose upon entry and deposit the therapeutic dose precisely at the so-called Bragg peak, with no residual dose beyond this point. The Bragg peak is the characteristic maximum that occurs when plotting the curve describing the rate of energy deposition along the length of the proton beam. Moreover, as a natural phenomenon, it is caused by an increase in the rate of nuclear interactions of protons as their energy decreases. From an analytical perspective, Bortfeld proposed a parametric family of curves that can be accurately calibrated to data replicating the Bragg peak in one dimension. We build, from first principles, the very first mathematical model describing the energy deposition of protons. Our approach uses stochastic differential equations and affords us the luxury of defining the natural analogue of the Bragg curve in two or three dimensions. This work is purely theoretical and provides a new mathematical framework which is capable of encompassing models built using Geant4 Monte Carlo, at one extreme, to pencil beam calculations with Bortfeld curves at the other.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Effects of Cluster Transfer-Induced Breakups on $^{12}$C Fragmentation in Hadron Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of standard Geant4 PhysicsLists to address the fragmentation of $^{12}$C$-^{12}$C was assessed through a comparative analysis with experimental cross sections reported by Divay et al. and Dudouet et al. The standard PhysicsLists were found to be inadequate in explaining the fragmentation systematics. To address this limitation, the breakup component of fragmentation was systematically integrated into the standard PhysicsList, which successfully replicated the differential and double differential cross sections for $\alpha$ production. This breakup component was modeled using fresco CDCC-CRC calculations. This novel physics process was then incorporated into the Geant4 framework, facilitating the calculation of dose distributions in water and tissue. The application of this method demonstrated a precise reproduction of the dose deposited at the Bragg peak region, corroborating the experimental data from Liedner et al., thereby enhancing the accurate visibility of dose tailing.</description>

      <title>Phantom-based gradient waveform measurements with compensated variable-prephasing: Description and application to EPI at 7T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Introducing "compensated variable-prephasing" (CVP), a phantom-based method for gradient waveform measurements. The technique is based on the "variable-prephasing" (VP) method, but takes into account the effects of all gradients involved in the measurement.
  Methods: We conducted measurements of a trapezoidal test gradient, and of an EPI readout gradient train with three approaches: VP, CVP, and "fully compensated variable-prephasing" (FCVP). We compared them to one another and to predictions based on the gradient system transfer function. Furthermore, we used the measured and predicted EPI gradients for trajectory corrections in phantom images on a 7T scanner.
  Results: The VP gradient measurements are confounded by lingering oscillations of the prephasing gradients, which are compensated in the CVP and FCVP measurements. FCVP is vulnerable to a sign asymmetry in the gradient chain. However, the trajectories determined by all three methods resulted in comparably high EPI image quality.
  Conclusion: We present a new approach allowing for phantom-based gradient waveform measurements with high precision, which can be useful for trajectory corrections in non-Cartesian or single-shot imaging techniques. In our experimental setup, the proposed "compensated variable-prephasing" method provided the most reliable gradient measurements of the different techniques we compared.</description>

      <title>PRIME: Phase Reversed Interleaved Multi-Echo acquisition enables highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a new pulse sequence for highly accelerated distortion-free diffusion MRI (dMRI) by inserting an additional echo without prolonging TR, when generalized slice dithered enhanced resolution (gSlider) radiofrequency encoding is used for volumetric acquisition. Methods: A phase-reversed interleaved multi-echo acquisition (PRIME) was developed for rapid, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI, which includes two echoes where the first echo is for target diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisition with high-resolution and the second echo is acquired with either 1) lower-resolution for high-fidelity field map estimation, or 2) matching resolution to enable efficient diffusion relaxometry acquisitions. The sequence was evaluated on in vivo data acquired from healthy volunteers on clinical and Connectome 2.0 scanners. Results: In vivo experiments demonstrated that 1) high in-plane acceleration (Rin-plane of 5-fold with 2D partial Fourier) was achieved using the high-fidelity field maps estimated from the second echo, which was made at a lower resolution/acceleration to increase its SNR while matching the effective echo spacing of the first readout, 2) high-resolution diffusion relaxometry parameters were estimated from dual-echo PRIME data using a white matter model of multi-TE spherical mean technique (MTE-SMT), and 3) high-fidelity mesoscale DWI at 550 um isotropic resolution could be obtained in vivo by capitalizing on the high-performance gradients of the Connectome 2.0 scanner. Conclusion: The proposed PRIME sequence enabled highly accelerated, high-resolution, and distortion-free dMRI using an additional echo without prolonging scan time when gSlider encoding is utilized.</description>

      <title>Reflection Measurement of the Scattering Mean Free Path at the Onset of Multiple Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple scattering of waves presents challenges for imaging complex media but offers potential for their characterization. Its onset is actually governed by the scattering mean free path $\ell_s$ that provides crucial information on the medium micro-architecture. Here, we introduce a reflection matrix method designed to estimate this parameter from the time decay of the single scattering rate. Our method is first validated by an ultrasound experiment on a tissue-mimicking phantom before being applied in-vivo to a human liver. This study opens important perspectives for quantitative imaging of heterogeneous media with waves, whether it be for non-destructive testing, biomedical or geophysical applications.</description>
