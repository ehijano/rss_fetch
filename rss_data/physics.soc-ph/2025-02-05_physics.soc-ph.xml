      <title>Exploring blazars through sonification. Visual and auditory insights into multifrequency variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using open astronomical multifrequency databases, we constructed light curves and developed a comprehensive visualisation and sonification analysis for the blazars Mrk~501, Mrk~1501, Mrk~421, BL~Lacerta, AO~0235+164, 3C~66A, OJ~049, OJ~287, and PKS~J2134-0153. This study employed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and Parameter Mapping Sonification (PMSon) techniques to generate waveforms, spectrograms, and sonifications. These representations demonstrate that data visualisation and sonification are powerful tools for analysing astronomical objects like blazers, providing insights into their multifrequency variability. This work highlights how sonification and visualisation can aid in identifying potential patterns, power variations, regularities, and gaps in the data. This multimodal approach also underscores the importance of inclusivity in scientific communication, offering accessible methods for exploring the complex behaviour of blazers.</description>

      <title>A new stochastic SIS-type modelling framework for analysing epidemic dynamics in continuous space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic epidemiological model defined in a continuous space of arbitrary dimension, based on SIS dynamics implemented in a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot (SLFV) process. The model can be described by as little as three parameters, and is dual to a spatial branching process with competition linked to genealogies of infected individuals. Therefore, it is a possible modelling framework to develop computationally tractable inference tools for epidemics in a continuous space using demographic and genetic data.
  We provide mathematical constructions of the process based on well-posed martingale problems as well as driving space-time Poisson point processes. With these devices and the duality relation in hand, we unveil some of the drivers of the transition between extinction and survival of the epidemic. In particular, we show that extinction is in large parts independent of the initial condition, and identify a strong candidate for the reproduction number $R_0$ of the epidemic in such a model.</description>

      <title>Measuring social mobility in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex networks, the rich-get-richer effect (nodes with high degree at one point in time gain more degree in their future) is commonly observed. In practice this is often studied on a static network snapshot, for example, a preferential attachment model assumed to explain the more highly connected nodes or a rich-club}effect that analyses the most highly connected nodes. In this paper, we consider temporal measures of how success (measured here as node degree) propagates across time. By analogy with social mobility (a measure people moving within a social hierarchy through their life) we define hierarchical mobility to measure how a node's propensity to gain degree changes over time. We introduce an associated taxonomy of temporal correlation statistics including mobility, philanthropy and community. Mobility measures the extent to which a node's degree gain in one time period predicts its degree gain in the next. Philanthropy and community measure similar properties related to node neighbourhood.
  We apply these statistics both to artificial models and to 26 real temporal networks. We find that most of our networks show a tendency for individual nodes and their neighbourhoods to remain in similar hierarchical positions over time, while most networks show low correlative effects between individuals and their neighbourhoods. Moreover, we show that the mobility taxonomy can discriminate between networks from different fields. We also generate artificial network models to gain intuition about the behaviour and expected range of the statistics. The artificial models show that the opposite of the "rich-get-richer" effect requires the existence of inequality of degree in a network. Overall, we show that measuring the hierarchical mobility of a temporal network is an invaluable resource for discovering its underlying structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12798</link>

Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay mathematical foundations for the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and mechanical effects in dense settings. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>

      <title>Behavioral and Topological Heterogeneities in Network Versions of Schelling's Segregation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models of residential segregation have been of persistent interest to various research communities since their origin with James Sakoda and popularization by Thomas Schelling. Frequently, these models have sought to elucidate the extent to which the collective dynamics of individual preferences may cause segregation to emerge. This open question has sustained relevance in U.S. jurisprudence. Previous investigation of heterogeneity of behaviors (preferences) by Xie &amp; Zhou has shown reductions in segregation. Meanwhile, previous investigation of heterogeneity of social network topologies by Gandica, Gargiulo, and Carletti has shown no significant impact to observed segregation levels. In the present study, we examined effects of the concurrent presence of both behavioral and topological heterogeneities in network segregation models. Simulations were conducted using both Schelling's and Xie &amp; Zhou's preference models on 2D lattices with varied levels of densification to create topological heterogeneities (i.e., clusters, hubs). Results show a richer variety of outcomes, including novel differences in resultant segregation levels and hub composition. Notably, with concurrent increased representations of heterogeneous preferences and heterogenous topologies, reduced levels of segregation emerge. Simultaneously, we observe a novel dynamic of segregation between tolerance levels as highly tolerant nodes take residence in dense areas and push intolerant nodes to sparse areas mimicking the urban-rural divide.</description>

      <title>The Physics and Metaphysics of Social Powers: Bridging Cognitive Processing and Social Dynamics, a New Perspective on Power through Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of power can be explored at several scales: from physical action and process effectuation, all the way to complex social dynamics. A spectrum-wide analysis of power requires attention to the fundamental principles that constrain these processes. In the social realm, the acquisition and maintenance of power is intertwined with both social interactions and cognitive processing capacity: socially-facilitated empowerment grants agents more information-processing capacities and opportunities, either by relying on others to bring about desired policies or ultimately outcomes, and/or by enjoying more information-processing possibilities as a result of relying on others for the reproduction of (material) tasks. The effects of social empowerment thus imply an increased ability to harness computation toward desired ends, thereby augmenting the evolution of a specific state space. Empowered individuals attract the attention of others, who contribute to increasing the scale of their access to various policies effectuating these state spaces. The presented argument posits that social power, in the context of active inference, is a function of several variables. As a result of its power-amplifying effects, this extended computational ability also buffers against possible vulnerabilities. We propose that individuals wield power not only by associating with others possessing desirable policies, but also by enhancing their ability to intake and compute information effectively. This dual mechanism is argued to create a cyclical, reinforcing pattern wherein the empowered are able to incrementally expand the scope of policies and state spaces available to them while minimizing risk-exposure.</description>
