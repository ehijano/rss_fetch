      <title>Uncertainty quantification in the Henry problem using the multilevel Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the applicability of the well-known multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to the class of density-driven flow problems, in particular the problem of salinisation of coastal aquifers. As a test case, we solve the uncertain Henry saltwater intrusion problem. Unknown porosity, permeability and recharge parameters are modelled by using random fields. The classical deterministic Henry problem is non-linear and time-dependent, and can easily take several hours of computing time. Uncertain settings require the solution of multiple realisations of the deterministic problem, and the total computational cost increases drastically. Instead of computing of hundreds random realisations, typically the mean value and the variance are computed. The standard methods such as the Monte Carlo or surrogate-based methods is a good choice, but they compute all stochastic realisations on the same, often, very fine mesh. They also do not balance the stochastic and discretisation errors. These facts motivated us to apply the MLMC method. We demonstrate that by solving the Henry problem on multi-level spatial and temporal meshes, the MLMC method reduces the overall computational and storage costs. To reduce the computing cost further, parallelization is performed in both physical and stochastic spaces. To solve each deterministic scenario, we run the parallel multigrid solver ug4 in a black-box fashion.</description>

      <title>An Exact Solution for Allocating Car Parking Spaces on Campus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All over the world, especially in the university environment, planning managers and traffic engineers are constantly faced with the problem of inadequate allocation of car parking spaces to demanded users. Users could either prefer reserved parking spaces to unreserved parking spaces or vice versa. This makes the campus parking manager to be faced with two basic problem which are: the problem of allocating the actual number of available reserved spaces to users without any conflict over the same parking space, and the problem of determining the number of parking permit to be issued for parking lot with unreserved spaces. Hence, an optimal or available solution to the problem is required. This paper investigates a model for allocating car parking spaces, adds a constraint to address the reserved parking policy in a university environment and solves the parking allocation problem using an exact solution method. The result obtained gives the value of the objective function and the optimal allocation of users to each parking lot.</description>

      <title>Shape Optimization of Geometrically Nonlinear Modal Coupling Coefficients: An Application to MEMS Gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoelectromechanical system (MEMS and NEMS) resonators can exhibit rich nonlinear dynamics as they are often operated at large amplitudes with high quality factors and possess a high mode density with a variety of nonlinear modal couplings. Their impact is strongly influenced by internal resonance conditions and by the strength of the modal coupling coefficients. On one hand, strong nonlinear couplings are of academic interest and promise novel device concepts. On the other hand, however, they have the potential to disturb the linear system behavior on which industrial devices such as gyroscopes and micro mirrors are based on. In either case, being able to optimize the coupling coefficients by design is certainly beneficial. A main source of nonlinear modal couplings are geometric nonlinearities. In this work, we apply node-based shape optimization to tune the geometrically nonlinear 3-wave coupling coefficients of a MEMS gyroscope. We demonstrate that individual coupling coefficients can be tuned over several orders of magnitude by shape optimization, while satisfying typical constraints on manufacturability and operability of the devices. The optimized designs contain unintuitive geometrical features far away from any solution an experienced human MEMS or NEMS designer could have thought of. Thus, this work demonstrates the power of shape optimization for tailoring the complex nonlinear dynamic properties of MEMS and NEMS resonators.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based predictive modelling of transonic flow over an aerofoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively predicting transonic unsteady flow over an aerofoil poses inherent challenges. In this study, we harness the power of deep neural network (DNN) models using the attention U-Net architecture. Through efficient training of these models, we achieve the capability to capture the complexities of transonic and unsteady flow dynamics at high resolution, even when faced with previously unseen conditions. We demonstrate that by leveraging the differentiability inherent in neural network representations, our approach provides a framework for assessing fundamental physical properties via global instability analysis. This integration bridges deep neural network models and traditional modal analysis, offering valuable insights into transonic flow dynamics and enhancing the interpretability of neural network models in flowfield diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Learning Flexible Body Collision Dynamics with Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many mesh-based graph neural network (GNN) models have been proposed for modeling complex high-dimensional physical systems. Remarkable achievements have been made in significantly reducing the solving time compared to traditional numerical solvers. These methods are typically designed to i) reduce the computational cost in solving physical dynamics and/or ii) propose techniques to enhance the solution accuracy in fluid and rigid body dynamics. However, it remains under-explored whether they are effective in addressing the challenges of flexible body dynamics, where instantaneous collisions occur within a very short timeframe. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Contact Mesh Transformer (HCMT), which uses hierarchical mesh structures and can learn long-range dependencies (occurred by collisions) among spatially distant positions of a body -- two close positions in a higher-level mesh correspond to two distant positions in a lower-level mesh. HCMT enables long-range interactions, and the hierarchical mesh structure quickly propagates collision effects to faraway positions. To this end, it consists of a contact mesh Transformer and a hierarchical mesh Transformer (CMT and HMT, respectively). Lastly, we propose a flexible body dynamics dataset, consisting of trajectories that reflect experimental settings frequently used in the display industry for product designs. We also compare the performance of several baselines using well-known benchmark datasets. Our results show that HCMT provides significant performance improvements over existing methods.
