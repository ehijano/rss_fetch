      <title>Microscopic Origin of the Entropy of Single-sided Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a state-counting derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for single-sided black holes. We firstly articulate the concept of the black hole microstates. Then we construct explicit mircostates of single-sided black holes in (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant. These microstates are constructed by putting a Karch-Randall brane behind the black hole horizon. Their difference is described by different interior excitations which gravitationally backreact. We show that these microstates have nonperturbatively small overlaps with each other. As a result, we use this fact to give a state-counting derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for single-sided black holes. At the end, we notice that there are no negative norm states in the resulting Hilbert space of the black hole microstates which in turn ensures unitarity. All calculations in this paper are analytic and can be easily generalized to higher spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. This non-abelian algebra presents an alternative lattice realization of the vector and axial symmetries, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XY model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Conformal Fields from Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the embedding formalism to construct conformal fields in $D$ dimensions, by restricting Lorentz-invariant ensembles of homogeneous neural networks in $(D+2)$ dimensions to the projective null cone. Conformal correlators may be computed using the parameter space description of the neural network. Exact four-point correlators are computed in a number of examples, and we perform a 4D conformal block decomposition that elucidates the spectrum. In some examples the analysis is facilitated by recent approaches to Feynman integrals. Generalized free CFTs are constructed using the infinite-width Gaussian process limit of the neural network, enabling a realization of the free boson. The extension to deep networks constructs conformal fields at each subsequent layer, with recursion relations relating their conformal dimensions and four-point functions. Numerical approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Virasoro Completeness Relation and Inverse Shapovalov Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an explicit expression for the inverse of the symmetric bilinear form of Virasoro Verma modules, the so-called Shapovalov form, in terms of singular vector operators and their conformal dimensions. Our proposed expression also determines the resolution of the identity for Verma modules of the Virasoro algebra, and can be thus employed in the computation of Virasoro conformal blocks via the sewing procedure.</description>

      <title>Dark dimension with (little) strings attached</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We motivate a relation between dark energy and the scale of new physics in weakly coupled string theory. This mixing between infrared and ultraviolet physics leads to a unique corner for real-world phenomenology: barring fine-tunings, we are naturally led to the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a single mesoscopic extra dimension of micron size with the standard model localized on D-branes. Our explicit top-down worldsheet derivation establishes it on a more solid grounding. Allowing some fine-tuning, such that the vacuum energy only arise at higher orders in string perturbation theory, the ``little string theory'' scenario with a very weakly coupled string is an alternative possibility. In this case, the string scale lies at the edge of detectability of particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>A note on non-Lorentzian duality symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work out non-Lorentzian dual actions for electromagnetism and linearised gravity, both in the Carrollian and Galilean cases. This is done in the same way as for Lorentzian theories, by first constructing a parent action that reduces to a pair of dual actions. In the case of Maxwell theory, each pair of dual actions consists of the known `electric' and `magnetic' limits of the original theories, showing that these limits are related by an off-shell electromagnetic duality. We have obtained dualities between on one hand the non-Lorentzian contractions of linearised gravity in second-order form, and on the other hand the theories one obtains by gauging the corresponding kinematic algebras. In the Carrollian contraction, these dual actions reproduce the known `electric' and `magnetic' Carrollian theories of gravity, and we find a similar result in the Galilean case.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of massive and massless particles in the spacetime of a wiggly cosmic dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spacetime containing both small-scale structures (wiggles) and spatial dislocation, forming a wiggly cosmic dislocation. We study the combined effects of these features on the dynamics of massive and massless particles. Our results show that while wiggles alone lead to bound states and dislocation introduces angular momentum corrections, their coupling produces more complex effects, influencing both particle motion and wave propagation. Notably, this coupling significantly modifies radial solutions and eigenvalues, with the direction of motion or propagation becoming a critical factor in determining the outcomes. Numerical solutions reveal detailed aspects of particle dynamics as functions of dislocation and string parameters, including plots of trajectories, radial probability densities, and energy levels. These findings deepen our understanding of how a wiggly cosmic dislocation shapes particle dynamics, suggesting new directions for theoretical exploration in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Analytic two-Loop four-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop four-point MHV form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). This form factor is analogous to the Higgs plus four-gluon amplitudes in the heavy-top limit of QCD when translated to the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM context. We obtain the full $D$-dimensional integrands up to two loops via unitarity-cut methods. Subsequently, we utilize IBP reduction to express the result in terms of a set of uniformly transcendental basis integrals, incorporating the two-loop non-planar five-point one-mass integrals recently given by Abreu et al. [PRL 132 (2024) 14]. We obtain the two-loop finite remainder in the functional form in terms of the pentagon functions. The symbol of our remainder confirms the bootstrap results reported by Dixon et al. [PRL 130 (2023) 11]. We perform various non-trivial checks of our results, including the triple-collinear limit, which recovers the two-loop six-gluon remainder. We also show that the form factor has a directional dual conformal symmetry at the integrand level. Our results are expected to shed further light on the study of antipodal dualities and the computation of Higgs plus four-parton amplitudes in QCD.</description>

      <title>Vacuum and Vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.</description>

      <title>Orbifolds of chiral fermionic CFTs and their duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider chiral fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) constructed from lattices and investigate their orbifolds under reflection and shift $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. For lattices based on binary error-correcting codes, we show the duality between reflection and shift orbifolds using a triality structure inherited from the binary codes. Additionally, we systematically compute the partition functions of the orbifold theories for both binary and nonbinary codes. Finally, we explore applications of this code-based construction in the search for supersymmetric CFTs and chiral fermionic CFTs without continuous symmetries.</description>

      <title>Notes on Selection Rules of Canonical Differential Equations and Relative Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explanation of the $\mathrm{d}\log$-form of the coefficient matrix of canonical differential equations using the projection of ($n$+1)-$\mathrm{d}\log$ forms onto $n$-$\mathrm{d}\log$ forms. This projection is done using the leading-order formula for intersection numbers. This formula gives a simple way to compute the coefficient matrix. When combined with the relative twisted cohomology, redundancy in computation using the regulator method can be avoided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Unruh effect with a direct, probability-level calculation. We rederive the transition rate of a uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt monopole detector coupled to a massive scalar field, from both the perspective of an inertial (Minkowski) observer and an accelerating (Rindler) observer. We show that, for a measurement at a finite time after the initial state is prepared, the two perspectives give the same transition rate. We show that an inertial detector in a thermal bath of Minkowski particles responds differently to the accelerated detector (which perceives a thermal bath of Rindler particles), except in the case of a massless field where there is agreement at all times. Finally, numerical results for the transition rate are presented and explained. We highlight the transient effects caused by forcing the field to initially be in the Minkowski vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study, Wei et al. [arXiv:2409.09333] proposed a universal classification scheme that interprets black hole solutions as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space, and then divides black hole solutions into four distinct classes, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$, offering insights into deeper aspects of black hole thermodynamics and gravity. In this paper, we investigate the universal thermodynamic topological classification of the singly rotating Kerr black holes in all dimensions, as well as the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole. We show that the innermost small black hole states of the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically unstable, while those of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes are thermodynamically stable. On the other hand, the outermost large black holes exhibit unstable behavior in all these cases. At the low-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have one large thermodynamically unstable black hole, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes feature one large unstable branch and one small stable branch. Conversely, at the high-temperature limit, the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes exhibit a small unstable black hole state, while the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole and the $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes have no black hole states at all. Consequently, we demonstrate that the $d \geq 6$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{1-}$, whereas the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman and $d = 4, 5$ singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to the class $W^{0+}$, thereby further support the conjecture proposed in [arXiv:2409.09333].</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Duality for Line Defect Correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particular integrated correlation functions of two superconformal primary operators of the stress tensor multiplet in the presence of a half-BPS line defect labelled by electromagnetic charges $(p,q)$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) with gauge group $SU(N)$. An important consequence of ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ electromagnetic duality in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM is that correlators of line defect operators with different charges $(p,q)$ must be related in a non-trivial manner when the complex coupling $\tau=\theta/(2\pi)+4\pi i /g_{_{\rm YM}}^2$ is transformed appropriately. In this work we introduce a novel class of real-analytic functions whose automorphic properties with respect to ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ match the expected transformations of line defect operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM under electromagnetic duality. At large $N$ and fixed $\tau$, the correlation functions we consider are related to scattering amplitudes of two gravitons from extended $(p,q)$-strings in the holographic dual type IIB superstring theory. We show that the large-$N$ expansion coefficients of the integrated two-point line defect correlators are given by finite linear combinations with rational coefficients of elements belonging to this class of automorphic functions. On the other hand, for any fixed value of $N$ we conjecture that the line defect integrated correlators can be expressed as formal infinite series over such automorphic functions. The resummation of this series produces a simple lattice sum representation for the integrated line defect correlator that manifests its automorphic properties. We explicitly demonstrate this construction for the cases with gauge group $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$. Our results give direct access to non-perturbative integrated correlators in the presence of an 't Hooft-line defect, observables otherwise very difficult to compute by other means.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced decoherence of a scalar field: investigating the one-particle sector and its interplay with renormalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the one-particle sector for the field-theoretical model of gravitationally induced decoherence for a scalar field in [1] with a special focus on the renormalisation of the one-particle master equation. In contrast to existing models in the literature, where the renormalisation is usually performed after the Markov and rotating wave approximation and often only for certain limits such as the non- or ultra-relativistic limit, here we apply the renormalisation directly after the one-particle projection. With this strategy, we show that UV-divergent contributions in the one-particle master equation can be identified with the vacuum contributions in the self-energy of the scalar field in the effective quantum field theory and depending on the chosen one-particle projection method, its vacuum bubbles, while the additional thermal contributions in the self-energy are all UV-finite. To obtain the renormalised one-particle master equation, we use an on-shell renormalisation procedure of the underlying effective QFT. We then apply the Markov and rotating wave approximation, specifying a condition under which the Markov approximation can be applied in the case of the ultra-relativistic limit. We compare our results with those available in the literature. This includes an analysis of two different kinds of one-particle projections, a comparison of the application and effects of renormalisation of quantum mechanical and field theoretical models, the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of the renormalised one-particle master equations, and a comparison with a quantum mechanical toy model for gravitationally induced decoherence in the context of neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Massless chiral fields in six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massless chiral fields of arbitrary spin in six spacetime dimensions, also known as higher spin singletons, admit a simple formulation in terms of $SL(2,\mathbb{H})$ tensors. We show that, paralleling the four-dimensional case, these fields can be described using a $0$-form and a gauge $2$-form, taking values in totally symmetric tensors of $SL(2,\mathbb{H})$. We then exhibit an example of interacting theory that couples a tower of singletons of all integer spin to a background of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued higher spin fields, for $\mathfrak{g}$ an arbitrary Lie algebra equipped with an invariant symmetric bilinear form. Finally, we discuss the formulation of these models in arbitrary even dimensions, as well as their partially-massless counterpart.</description>

      <title>Matter-coupled higher spin gravities in 3d: no- and yes-go results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massless higher-spin fields show no preference for any value of the cosmological constant in $3d$. All matter-free higher-spin gravities in 3d are equivalent to Chern-Simons theories with an appropriate choice of gauge algebra. For various reasons, including holography, it is important to enrich them with matter fields. In $(A)dS_3$, the coupling of matter fields to higher-spin fields is well-known to the leading order and is determined by the representation theory. We extend this result to flat space, where the relevant higher-spin algebra is the Poisson algebra, aka $w_{1+\infty}$. However, we show that both in flat and $(A)dS_3$ spaces there are no nontrivial higher order deformations/interactions. Nevertheless, by enlarging the field content with some auxiliary fields and taking advantage of the chiral higher-spin gravity's vertices, it is possible to construct an exotic matter-coupled theory on $(A)dS_3$. It also admits a flat limit. The equations of motion have the form of a Poisson sigma-model and a meaningful action has the form of a Courant sigma-model. We also explore the potential for embedding this theory into a holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Worldline Proof of Eikonal Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, working in the eikonal approximation, we present a proof for the exponentiation of the 2-body eikonal phase to {\it all orders in the eikonal expansion}, for scalar particles interacting electromagnetically or gravitationally. The proof is based on the worldline formalism, which is an alternative, first quantized method to the standard QFT calculation of the scattering amplitude. We show that in the worldline formalism the 2-body scattering amplitude written in impact parameter space naturally factorizes at each loop order. This factorization is responsible for the exponentiation of the eikonal phase, a result which was anticipated in the work of Mogull, Plefka, and Steinhoff [2010.02865 [hep-th]].</description>

      <title>On the classical limit of the (sub)$^{n}$-leading soft graviton theorems in $D = 4$ without deflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree-level gravitational amplitudes satisfy an infinite hierarchy of soft factorization theorems. The existence of these theorems has been recently linked with the existence of an infinite tower of asymptotic symmetries. In this paper, we analyze the relevance of the soft graviton theorems beyond sub-leading order in the context of classical gravitational scattering in four dimensions. More in detail, we show that the infinite impact parameter limit of the late-time gravitational field emitted during a classical scattering can be derived using these factorization theorems. The classical field obtained in this (infinite impact parameter) regime has an expansion in the frequency of the detector where the modes scale as $\omega^{n}\log{\omega}$ with a vanishing memory.</description>

      <title>Holographic correlators with BPS bound states in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute 4-point correlators in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ Super-Yang-Mills with both single and double-particle $1/2$-BPS operators in the regime of large 't Hooft coupling and large $N$. In particular we give explicit expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(1/N^4)$ for the lightest correlator with two double-particle and two single-particle operators built out of the stress-tensor multiplet. Our derivation makes use of the general holographic prescription applied to an asymptotically AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ geometry that describes a coherent superposition of multi-graviton operators. The final result can be written in terms of a natural generalisation of the standard D-functions and takes a compact form in Mellin space. The correlator we compute here is the simplest of a more general class of correlators where two inserted operators are multi-particles. These can be derived with the same approach, suggesting that the structure found here is general.</description>

      <title>Phase space of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct the classical phase space of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant on spatial slices with circle topology. This turns out to be somewhat more intricate than in the case of negative cosmological constant; this phase space has many singular points and is not even Hausdorff. Nonetheless, it admits a group-theoretic description which is quite amenable to quantization.</description>

      <title>Barrow Holographic Dark Energy in $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity: A dynamical system perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of the Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BADE) model within the framework of $f(Q,L_{m})$ gravity, specifically considering the model $f(Q,L_{m})=\alpha Q+\beta L_{m}$. Using a dynamical system approach for both non-interacting and interacting scenarios, we identify critical points corresponding to different phases of the Universe's evolution, including matter domination, radiation domination and dark energy-driven accelerated expansion. Our analysis reveals two stable critical points in the non-interacting case and three stable critical points in the interacting case, each indicating a transition to a stable phase dominated by BADE. The phase plots clearly demonstrate the evolution of the Universe's dynamics toward these stable points. At these stable points, the deceleration parameter is negative, consistent with accelerated expansion and the equation of state parameter suggests that BADE behaves as a dark energy component. These findings highlight the BADE model's strength as a viable explanation for the Universe's late-time acceleration inside $f(Q, L_{m})$ gravity, and they provide novel perspectives on the cosmic development of dark energy-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the impact of the phantom field (or anti-Maxwell field) on the structure of three-dimensional black holes in the presence of the cosmological constant, we present the first extraction of solutions for the phantom BTZ (A)dS black hole. In this study, we analyze the effect of the phantom field on the horizon structure. Furthermore, we compare the BTZ black holes in the presence of both the phantom and Maxwell fields. Additionally, we calculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities of the phantom BTZ black holes, demonstrating their compliance with the first law of thermodynamics. Subsequently, we assess the effects of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on the local stability in the canonical ensemble by considering these fields with respect to the heat capacity. We then investigate the global stability area of the BTZ black holes with phantom and Maxwell fields within the grand canonical ensemble using Gibbs free energy. In this analysis, we evaluate the influence of the electrical charge and the cosmological constant on this area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we approach the structure of the quantum measuring system in the Euclidean regime of the classicalized holographic tensor network from the perspective of integrated information theory. As a result, we obtain the following picture of the Euclidean regime. First, there are complexes, which are independently accompanied by the level and structure of experiences, determined from the full transition probability matrix of the whole particle system. Second, the cause-effect structures of independent complexes would be directly entangled by the physical information propagation in the whole particle system. Finally, distinct full transition probability matrices of the whole particle system that exhibit the maximum cause-effect power may coexist.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetized Black Holes and Swirling Backgrounds in Nonlinear Electrodynamics: The ModMax case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on constructing electromagnetized black holes and vortex-like backgrounds within the framework of the ModMax theory--the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's theory that preserves conformal symmetry and electromagnetic duality invariance. We begin by constructing the Melvin-Bonnor electromagnetic universe in ModMax through a limiting procedure that connects the spacetime of two charged accelerating black holes with that of a gravitating homogeneous electromagnetic field. Building on this result, we proceed to construct the Schwarzschild and C-metric Melvin-Bonnor black holes within the ModMax theory, representing the first black hole solutions embedded in an electromagnetic universe in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics. While the characteristics of the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and some of its black hole extensions have been widely examined, we demonstrate for the first time that the Schwarzschild-Melvin-Bonnor configuration exhibits an unusual Kerr-Schild representation. Following this direction, we also unveil a novel Kerr-Schild construction for the spacetime of two accelerating black holes, drawing on the intrinsic relationship between the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and the C-metric. Finally, we expand the spectrum of exact gravitational solutions within Einstein-ModMax theory by constructing a vortex-like background that coexists with the Melvin-Bonnor universe. In this process, the Taub-NUT spacetime in ModMax has played a crucial role. We also present an extended Taub-NUT solution that incorporates the contribution of a monopole-like magnetic component in the gauge field.</description>

      <title>On the Hilbert Space of the Chern-Simons Matrix Model, Deformed Double Current Algebra Action, and the Conformal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern-Simons matrix model was proposed by Dorey, Tong, and Turner to describe non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we study the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model from a geometric quantization point of view. We show that the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model can be identified with the space of sections of a line bundle on the quiver variety associated to a framed Jordan quiver. We compute the character of the Hilbert space using localization technique. Using a natural isomorphism between vortex moduli space and a Beilinson-Drinfeld Schubert variety, we prove that the ground states wave functions are flat sections of a bundle of conformal blocks associated to a WZW model. In particular they solve a Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We show that there exists a natural action of the deformed double current algebra (DDCA) on the Hilbert space, moreover the action is irreducible.
  We define and study the conformal limit of the Chern-Simons matrix model. We show that the conformal limit of the Hilbert space is an irreducible integrable module of $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ with level identified with the matrix model level. Moreover, we prove that $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ generators can be obtained from scaling limits of matrix model operators, which settles a conjecture of Dorey-Tong-Turner. The key to the proof is the construction of a Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the conformal limit of the Hilbert space, which we expect to be equivalent to the $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the integrable $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ modules constructed by Uglov. We also characterize eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix model Hilbert space with respect to a maximal commutative subalgebra of Yangian.</description>

      <title>Mixed phases of compact star matter in a unified mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on an extended NJL model that treats baryons as clusters of quarks, we investigate the properties and microscopic structures of mixed phases for various types of first-order phase transitions in a unified manner, where the model parameters are fixed by reproducing nuclear matter properties and the binding energies of finite nuclei. In particular, based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation, we investigate the mixed phases arise from the liquid-gas phase transition of nuclear matter, chiral phase transition, and deconfinement phase transition in dense stellar matter adopting spherical and cylindrical approximations for the Wigner-Seitz cells. It is found that the geometrical structures do not emerge for chiral phases transition, while the droplet, rod, slab, tube, and bubble phases emerge sequentially as density increases for the liquid-gas and deconfinement phase transitions. Additional attractive interactions between strange quark matter and hyperons are observed as the deconfinement phase transition is entangled with chiral phase transition of $s$ quarks. The results obtained here should be useful to understand the properties and structures of dense stellar matter throughout compact stars and in particular the matter state in the core regions. Meanwhile, more extensive investigations in a three-dimensional geometry with large box sizes are necessary for our future study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we replace the standard partial derivatives in the Klein-Gordon equation with Dunkl derivatives and obtain exact analytical solutions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dunkl-Klein-Gordon equation in higher dimensions. We apply this formalism to two key quantum mechanical systems: the d-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential. First, we introduce Dunkl quantum mechanics in d-dimensional polar coordinates, followed by an analysis of the d-dimensional Dunkl-Klein-Gordon oscillator. Subsequently, we derive the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions, which are expressed using confluent hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the Dunkl formalism on both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In the second case, we explore both the bound-state solutions and scattering scenarios of the Dunkl-Klein-Gordon equation with the Coulomb potential. The bound-state solutions are represented in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions, while the scattering states enable us to compute the particle creation density and probability using the Bogoliubov transformation method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Axion-like Curvaton: Non-Gaussianity and Primordial Black Holes Without Large Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.</description>

      <title>Instantons and transseries of the Mathieu potential deformed by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-perturbative effects of a deformation of the Mathieu differential equation consistent with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. First, we develop a connection between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian scenarios by a reparameterization in the complex plane, followed by a restriction of the $\mathcal{PT}$ deformation parameter. The latter is responsible for preserving the information about $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry when we choose to work in the Hermitian scenario. We note that this factor is present in all non-perturbative results and in the transseries representation of the deformed Mathieu partition function that we have obtained. In quantum mechanics, we found that the deformation parameter of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has an effect on the real instanton solution for the deformed Mathieu potential in the Hermitian scenario. As its value increases, the non-Hermiticity factor makes it smoother for the instanton to pass from one minimum to another, that is, it modifies the instanton width. The explanation for this lies in the fact that the height of the potential barrier decreases as we increase the value of the deformation parameter. We present how this effect extends to the multi-instanton level and to the bounce limit of an instanton-anti-instanton pair. As an application of the obtained results, we show that the equation of motion under a tilted version of the potential in the Hermitian scenario compares to the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model for the Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and dynamics of coupled complex SYK models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14644v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that the large-$q$ complex SYK model falls under the same universality class as that of van der Waals (mean-field) and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, both features shared by various black holes. This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties, specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures, similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex quantum systems. We provide a detailed outlook for future work by considering the "very" low-temperature regime, where we discuss relations with the Hawking-Page phase transition observed in the holographic dual black holes. We present preliminary calculations and discuss the possible follow-ups that might be taken to make the connection robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various aspects of capacity of entanglement in the squeezed states of a scalar field theory. This quantity is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity and characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix. In particular, we carefully examine the dependence of capacity of entanglement and its universal terms on the squeezing parameter in the specific regimes of the parameter space. Remarkably, we find that the capacity of entanglement obeys a volume law in the large squeezing limit. We discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including entanglement and Renyi entropies. We also comment on the existence of consistent holographic duals for a family of Gaussian states with generic squeezing parameter based on the ratio of entanglement entropy and the capacity of entanglement.</description>

Abstract: The trans-series completion of perturbative series of a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be determined by combining the resurgence program and extra input coming from exact WKB analysis. In this paper, we reexamine the Harper-Hofstadter model and its spectrum, Hofstadter's butterfly, in light of recent developments. We demonstrate the connection between the perturbative energy series of the Harper-Hofstadter model and the vev of $1/2$-BPS Wilson loop of 5d SYM and clarify the differences between their non-perturbative corrections. Taking insights from the cosine potential model, we construct the full energy trans-series for flux $\phi=2\pi/Q$ and provide numerical evidence with remarkably high precision. Finally, we revisit the problem of self-similarity of the butterfly and discuss the possibility of a completed version of the Rammal-Wilkinson formula.</description>

Abstract: The matrix of canonical differential equations consists of the 1-$\mathrm{d}\log$-form coefficients obtained by projecting ($n$+1)-$\mathrm{d}\log$-forms onto $n$-$\mathrm{d}\log$-form master integrands. With dual form in relative cohomology, the intersection number can be used to achieve the projection and provide the selection rules for canonical differential equations, which relate to the pole structure of the $\mathrm{d}\log$ master integrands.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the isomorphism between the AdS Carroll and Poincar\'e algebras, we map the three-dimensional asymptotically flat solutions of Poincar\'e gravity into an AdS Carroll spacetime. We show the mapped solutions satisfy the field equations of the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS Carroll gravity and exhibit a Carroll geometry structure. Despite the presence of a negative cosmological constant in the mapped spacetime, the algebra of the canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetries is given by the $\mathfrak{bms}_3$ algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of capacity of entanglement in certain setups whose entanglement entropy becomes extensive and obeys a volume law. In particular, considering geometric decomposition of the Hilbert space, we study this measure both in the vacuum state of a family of non-local scalar theories and also in the squeezed states of a local scalar theory. We also evaluate field space capacity of entanglement between interacting scalar field theories. We present both analytical and numerical evidences for the volume law scaling of this quantity in different setups and discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including Renyi entropies. Our study reveals some generic properties of the capacity of entanglement and the corresponding reduced density matrix in the specific regimes of the parameter space. Finally, by comparing entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement, we discuss some implications of our results on the existence of consistent holographic duals for the models in question.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of a quantum Lifshitz black hole in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the mass-gap of a four-dimensional near-extremal Lifshitz black hole that arises as a solution to a low energy effective theory of heterotic string theory. The effective two-dimensional gravitational description retains features of the Lifshitz symmetry, which break the usual $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariance down to $U(1)$. For this effective two-dimensional gravitational description, we derive a one-dimensional Schwarzian-like description, which inherits the $U(1)$ symmetry. The Schwarzian-like description allows us to compute a logarithmic correction to the entropy through a saddle-point approximation of the two-dimensional partition function. This logarithmic correction removes the mass-gap, as expected. Furthermore, the prefactor of the logarithmic term is $\frac{1}{2}$, rather than $\frac{3}{2}$ found for the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ invariant description, indeed reflecting having fewer symmetries.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <title>Phases and Phase transitions of U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetric holographic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase diagram and symmetry breaking patterns of a holographic CFT with U(1)$\times$SU(2) symmetry are analyzed using the simplest holographic action, namely Einstein-Yang-Mills (YM) theory with a negative cosmological constant. This is relevant for both condensed matter and QCD applications. With a U(1) and an "isospin" chemical potential turned on, we determine all possible symmetry breaking patterns, which are associated to the condensation of spin-one order parameters. The possible IR asymptotics of the Einstein-YM solutions are derived analytically, both for 2+1 and 3+1 boundary dimensions. The competing solutions are then computed numerically, both at zero and non-zero temperature, from which the full three-dimensional phase diagram is determined. We find a surface of second order phase transitions that separate uncondensed and condensed phases. In some regions with a large fraction of charged to neutral degrees of freedom, the phase transition becomes first order.</description>

Abstract: We consider spinors on the total space of a Kaluza-Klein model with fuzzy sphere fibre and geometrically realised Dirac operator on the product. We show that a single massless spinor on the product appears on spacetime as multiplets of spinors with a particular signature of differing masses and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills charges. For example, for the reduced fuzzy sphere isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, a massless spinor appears as two $SU(2)$ doublets and an $SU(2)$ quadruplet in mass ratios $1:5/3:7/3$. Although such signatures do not appear to exactly match the Standard Model, the paper provides proof of concept of the approach, which can be applied to other noncommutative fibre algebras.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase assisted detection of Lorentz-invariance violation from modified dispersion at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many theories of quantum gravity propose Lorentz-violating dispersion relations of the form $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}=|\mathbf{k}|f(|\mathbf{k}|/M_\star)$, which approximately recover to the Lorentz invariance, $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}\approx|\mathbf{k}|$, at the energy scales much below $M_\star$. However, usually such a scale is assumed to be near the Planck scale, thus the feature of the Lorentz-violating theory is weak and its experimental test becomes extremely challenging. Since the geometric phase (GP) is of accumulative and sensitive nature to weak effects, here we explore the GP acquired by an inertial atomic detector that is coupled to a quantum field with this kind of Lorentz-violating dispersion. We show that for the Lorentz-violating field theory case the GP depends on the velocity of the detector, which is quite different from the Lorentz symmetry case where the GP is independent of the detector's velocity. In particular, we show that the GP may present a drastic low-energy Lorentz violation for any $f$ that dips below unity somewhere. We apply our analysis to detecting the polymer quantization motivated by loop quantum gravity, and show the detector acquires an experimentally detectable GP with the assist of detector's velocity that below current ion collider rapidities. Furthermore, the accumulative nature of GP might facilitate the relevant detection significantly.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) capability, two properties of fundamental importance to the physics and practical use of quantum many-body systems, covering systems with both all-to-all connectivity and geometric scenarios like lattice systems in finite spatial dimensions. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that, for a code encoding $k$ logical qubits in $n$ physical qubits, if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold, then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial "phases" of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding quantum complexity and order in many-body quantum systems, generating new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant "scaling threshold" of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

Abstract: The method of regions, which provides a systematic approach for computing Feynman integrals involving multiple kinematic scales, proposes that a Feynman integral can be approximated and even reproduced by summing over integrals expanded in certain regions. A modern perspective of the method of regions considers any given Feynman integral as a specific Newton polytope, defined as the convex hull of the points associated with Symanzik polynomials. The regions then correspond one-to-one with the lower facets of this polytope.
  As Symanzik polynomials correspond to the spanning trees and spanning 2-trees of the Feynman graph, a graph-theoretical study of these polynomials may allow us to identify the complete set of regions for a given expansion. In this work, our primary focus is on three specific expansions: the on-shell expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, the soft expansion of generic wide-angle scattering, and the mass expansion of heavy-to-light decay. For each of these expansions, we employ graph-theoretical approaches to derive the generic forms of the regions involved in the method of regions. The results, applicable to all orders, offer insights that can be leveraged to investigate various aspects of scattering amplitudes.</description>

Abstract: Contrary to conformal transformations, disformal transformations can change the principal null directions of a spacetime geometry. Thus, depending on the frame a gravitational wave (GW) detector minimally couples to, the properties of GWs may change under a disformal transformation. In this paper, we provide \textit{necessary} and \textit{sufficient} conditions which determine whether GWs change under disformal transformations or not. Our argument is coordinate-independent and can be applied to any spacetime geometry at the fully non-linear level. As an example, we show that an exact radiative solution of massless Einstein-scalar gravity which admits only shear-free parallel transported frame is mapped to a disformed geometry which does not possess any shear-free parallel transported frame. This radiative geometry and its disformed counterpart provide a concrete example of the possibility to generate tensorial GWs from a disformal transformation at the fully non-linear level. This type of non-linear effect can be completely overlooked in the usual linear perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a phenomenologically and theoretically consistent limit of the generic Einstein-Aether theory in which the Einstein-Aether field equations reduce to Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid distribution sourced by the aether field. This limit is obtained by taking three of the coupling constants of the theory to be zero but keeping the expansion coupling constant to be nonzero. We then consider the further reduction of this limited version of Einstein-Aether theory by taking the expansion of the aether field to be constant (possibly zero), and thereby we introduce the Minimal Einstein-Aether theory that supports the Einstein metrics as solutions with a reduced cosmological constant. The square of the expansion of the unit-timelike aether field shifts the bare cosmological constant and thus provides, via local Lorentz symmetry breaking inherent in the Einstein-Aether theories, a novel mechanism for reconciling the observed, small cosmological constant (or dark energy) with the large theoretical prediction coming from quantum field theories. The crucial point here is that minimal Einstein-Aether theory does not modify the well-tested aspects of General Relativity such as solar system tests and black hole physics including gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Disjointness of inertial KMS states and the role of Lorentz symmetry in thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any local, translation-covariant quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime, we prove that two distinct states that are invariant under the inertial time evolutions in different inertial reference frames are disjoint, i.e. neither state is a perturbation of the other, if the states are primary, have separating Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) vectors, and satisfy a timelike cluster property called the mixing property. These conditions are fulfilled by the inertial Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states of the free scalar field, thus showing that a state satisfying the KMS condition relative to one inertial frame is far from thermal equilibrium relative to other inertial frames. We review the property of return to equilibrium (RTE) in open quantum systems theory and discuss the implications of disjointness on the asymptotic behavior of detector systems coupled to states of a free massless scalar field. We argue that the coupled system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant velocity relative to the field in a KMS state, or an excitation thereof, cannot thermalize under generic conditions. This leads to an illustration of the physical differences between heat baths in inertial systems and the alleged "heat bath" of the Unruh effect. This paper also sketches the construction and RTE property of the quantum dynamical system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in a KMS state relative to the inertial rest frame of the detector.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Neutrino Decoupling and its Observable Imprints: Insights from Entropic-Dual Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very different processes characterize the decoupling of neutrinos to form the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B) and the much later decoupling of photons from thermal equilibrium to form the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The C$\nu$B emerges from the fuzzy, energy-dependent neutrinosphere and encodes the physics operating in the early universe in the temperature range $T\sim 10\,{\rm MeV}$ to $T\sim10\,{\rm keV}$. This is the epoch where beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics may be influential in setting the light element abundances and the necessarily distorted fossil neutrino energy spectra. Here we use techniques honed in extensive CMB studies to analyze the C$\nu$B as calculated in detailed neutrino energy transport and nuclear reaction simulations. Our moment method, relative entropy, and differential visibility approach can leverage future high precision CMB and primordial abundance measurements to provide new insights into the C$\nu$B and any BSM physics it encodes. We demonstrate that the evolution of the energy spectrum of the C$\nu$B throughout the weak decoupling epoch is accurately captured in the Standard Model by only three parameters per species, a non-trivial conclusion given the deviation from thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we can interpret each of the three parameters as physical characteristics of a non-equilibrium system. The success of our compact description within the Standard Model motivates its use also in BSM scenarios. We demonstrate how observations of primordial light element abundances can be used to place constraints on the C$\nu$B energy spectrum, deriving response functions that can be applied for general C$\nu$B spectral distortions. Combined with the description of those deviations that we develop here, our methods provide a convenient and powerful framework to constrain the impact of BSM physics on the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Geodesic completeness, cosmological bounces and inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of geodesic completeness of cosmological spacetimes has recently received renewed scrutiny. A particularly interesting result is the observation that the well-known Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem may misdiagnose geodesically complete cosmologies. We propose a simple amendment to the BGV theorem which addresses such loopholes while retaining much of its generality. We give straightforward proofs of some recently offered conjectures concerning (generalized) Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes: geodesic completeness implies (i) the existence of a bounce, loitering phase or an emergent cosmology, and (ii) a phase of accelerated expansion with strictly increasing Hubble rate. Our results are purely kinematic and do not assume general relativity or energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Transforming the Bootstrap: Using Transformers to Compute Scattering Amplitudes in Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pursue the use of deep learning methods to improve state-of-the-art computations in theoretical high-energy physics. Planar N = 4 Super Yang-Mills theory is a close cousin to the theory that describes Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider; its scattering amplitudes are large mathematical expressions containing integer coefficients. In this paper, we apply Transformers to predict these coefficients. The problem can be formulated in a language-like representation amenable to standard cross-entropy training objectives. We design two related experiments and show that the model achieves high accuracy (&gt; 98%) on both tasks. Our work shows that Transformers can be applied successfully to problems in theoretical physics that require exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling in Bosonic Gaussian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those in chaotic systems. Specifically, for initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks and the negative values of tripartite mutual information. We also find that the spectral form factor for these integrable systems exhibits a ramp. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, the ramp is nonlinear, and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display power-law growth for certain operators and Gaussian dynamics. These findings indicate that information scrambling driven by randomness is distinct from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Gravity Effects with Eccentric Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and the results indicate that LQG effects cause the orbital decay to occur faster compared to the Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we use the augmented analytic kludge approach to generate EMRI waveforms and study the LISA's capability to detect the LQG effect with faithfulness. Additionally, employing the Fisher information matrix method for parameter estimation, we estimate that after one year of observation, the uncertainty in $r_0$ reduces to approximately $6.59\times 10^{-4}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $49$.</description>
