      <title>Modern approaches to building effective interpretable models of the property market using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models of property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of property in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in this topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good model. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market data and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine learning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial data, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in data, the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual examples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for land parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point the application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest linear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules on the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that despite the strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is important in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still possible to build effective models of real property markets.</description>

      <title>Joint News, Attention Spillover,and Market Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:1703.02715v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing a comprehensive news dataset, we document that joint news coverage triggers attention contagion, causing temporarily inflated valuations for affected stocks. Tracing SEC EDGAR visits from unique IPs, we provide direct evidence of attention spillovers between stocks. Stocks with greater joint news coverage exhibit increased Google search activity, higher contemporaneous returns, and subsequent reversals. Notably, aggregated joint news coverage strongly and negatively predicts future market returns. This relationship holds out-of-sample, persists after controlling for existing predictors and fundamental linkages, and intensifies during periods of heightened uncertainty or significant market frictions. Our findings indicate that attention contagion contributes to marketwide overvaluations.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Beyond: Positive Definite Dependence Measures for Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios, and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15268v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than the combined effects of other parameters in investment and risk models, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for essential purposes such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals. This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls, Spearmans, Tail Dependence Matrix, and others). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Importantly, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios. NAbC stands alone in providing all of these capabilities simultaneously, and should prove to be a very useful means by which we can better understand and manage financial portfolios in our multivariate world.</description>
