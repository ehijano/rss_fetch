      <title>A general theory of the standard model and the revelation of the dark side of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general theory of the Standard Model is presented in a spin-related gravigauge spacetime, grounded on conformal inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS$_c$(1,3)=SP(1,3)$\rtimes$W$^{1,3}$$\rtimes$SP$_c$(1,1) and scaling gauge symmetry SG(1), along with symmetry U$_Y$(1)$\times$SU$_L$(2)$\times$SU(3)$_c$ in the standard model. It introduces new interactions: spin, chirality boost-spin, chiral conformal-spin, and scaling gauge forces. A gravitization equation is obtained to describe the gravitational effects emerging from the non-commutative derivative operator in gravigauge spacetime. In the framework of gravitational quantum field theory(GQFT), the gravitational force is mediated by the gravigauge field, identified as the massless graviton. Both gauge-type and geometric-type gravitational equations are derived to describe gravidynamics beyond general relativity. A massive chirality boost-spin gauge boson, termed the dark graviton, acts as a dark matter candidate, interacting with leptons and quarks via a spin gauge boson. A fundamental scalar field serves as a source of primordial energy and dark energy, driving the early inflation and current accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Resolving the paradox of the Dirac equation: phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08009v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the results of F. Wilf on the need to take into account the quantum-mechanical correspondence rules in the Dirac equation for an electron, it was shown that the equation obtained by giving physical meaning to $\alpha$-Dirac operators should be considered as a phenomenological equation for a particle of non-zero size - the EM polaron, previously introduced by the author. This allows a solution to be found to the inherent paradox of the Dirac equation, which consists of the equality of the velocity of the moving particles to the speed of light $c$ in a vacuum, which is a priori unobtainable, and to understand the physical essence of spin as the intrinsic mechanical moment of an EM polaron. It is also shown that the Dirac-Wilf equation for a single spatial dimension can be considered a generalization of the Schrodinger equation for relativistic energies.</description>

      <title>Why Poincare symmetry is a good approximate symmetry in particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As shown in the famous Dyson's paper "Missed Opportunities", even from purely mathematical considerations (without any physics) it follows that Poincare quantum symmetry is a special degenerate case of de Sitter quantum symmetries. Then the question arises why in particle physics Poincare symmetry works with a very high accuracy. The usual answer to this question is that a theory in de Sitter space becomes a theory in Minkowski space in the formal limit when the radius of de Sitter space tends to infinity. However, de Sitter and Minkowski spaces are purely classical concepts, and in quantum theory the answer to this question must be given only in terms of quantum concepts. At the quantum level, Poincare symmetry is a good approximate symmetry if the eigenvalues of the representation operators $M_{4\mu}$ of the anti-de Sitter algebra are much greater than the eigenvalues of the operators $M_{\mu\nu}$ ($\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3$). We show that explicit solutions with such properties exist within the framework of the approach proposed by Flato and Fronsdal where particles that are considered elementary in the standard theory are bound states of two Dirac singletons.</description>
