      <title>Key-avoidance for alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of key-avoidance on alternating sign matrices (ASMs) defined via pattern-avoidance on an associated permutation called the \emph{key} of an ASM. We enumerate alternating sign matrices whose key avoids a given set of permutation patterns in several instances. We show that ASMs whose key avoids $231$ are permutations, thus any known enumeration for a set of permutation patterns including $231$ extends to ASMs. We furthermore enumerate by the Catalan numbers ASMs whose key avoids both $312$ and $321$. We also show ASMs whose key avoids $312$ are in bijection with the gapless monotone triangles of [Ayyer, Cori, Gouyou-Beauchamps 2011]. Thus key-avoidance generalizes the notion of $312$-avoidance studied there. Finally, we enumerate ASMs with a given key avoiding $312$ and $321$ using a connection to Schubert polynomials, thereby deriving an interesting Catalan identity.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time immunization number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete-time immunization version of the SEIS compartment model of infection by a contagious disease, with an extended latency and protective period. The population is modeled by a graph $H$ where vertices represent individuals and edges exist between individuals with close connections. Our objective is to clear the population of infection while minimizing the maximum number of immunizations that occur at each time-step. We prove that this minimum is bounded above by a natural function of the pathwidth of $H$. In addition to our general results, we also focus on the case where the latency and protective periods last for one time-step. In this case, we characterize graphs that require only one immunization per time-step, provide a useful tool for proving lower bounds, and show that, for any tree $T$, there is a subdivision of $T$ that requires at most two immunizations per time-step.</description>

      <title>Equatorial Flow Triangulations of Gorenstein Flow Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing work of Athanasiadis for the Birkhoff polytope and Reiner and Welker for order polytopes, in 2007 Bruns and R\"omer proved that any Gorenstein lattice polytope with a regular unimodular triangulation admits a regular unimodular triangulation that is the join of a special simplex with a triangulated sphere. These are sometimes referred to as equatorial triangulations. We apply these techniques to give purely combinatorial descriptions of previously-unstudied triangulations of Gorensten flow polytopes. Further, we prove that the resulting equatorial flow polytope triangulations are usually distinct from the family of triangulations obtained by Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy via framings. We find the facet description of the reflexive polytope obtained by projecting a Gorenstein flow polytope along a special simplex. Finally, we show that when a partially ordered set is strongly planar, equatorial triangulations of a related flow polytope can be used to produce new unimodular triangulations of the corresponding order polytope.</description>

      <title>More results on stack-sorting for set partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let a sock be an element of an ordered finite alphabet A and a sequence of these elements be a sock sequence. In 2023, Xia introduced a deterministic version of Defant and Kravitz's stack-sorting map by defining the $\phi_{\sigma}$ and $\phi_{\overline{\sigma}}$ pattern-avoidance stack-sorting maps for sock sequences. Xia showed that the $\phi_{aba}$ map is the only one that eventually sorts all set partitions; in this paper, we prove deeper results regarding $\phi_{aba}$ and $\phi_{\overline{aba}}$ as a natural next step. We newly define two algorithms with time complexity $O(n^3)$ that determine if any given sock sequence is in the image of $\phi_{aba}$ or $\phi_{\overline{aba}}$ respectively. We also show that the maximum number of preimages that a sock sequence of length $n$ has grows at least exponentially under both the $\phi_{aba}$ and $\phi_{\overline{aba}}$ maps. Additionally, we prove results regarding fertility numbers (introduced by Defant) in the context of set partitions and multiple-pattern-avoiding stacks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that for all length 3 patterns, all positive integers are fertility numbers for the consecutive-pattern-avoiding stack-sorting map $\textrm{SC}_\sigma$, which resolves conjecture 8.3 from Defant and Zheng. The paper ends with a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Inverse symmetric division deg index and the relation with other topological indices of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph. The concept of Inverse symmetric division deg index $(ISDD)$ was introduced in the chemical graph theory very recently. In spite of this, a few papers have already appeared with this index in the literature. Ghorbani et al. proposed Inverse symmetric division deg index and is defined as $$ISDD(G)=\sum\limits_{v_iv_j\in E(G)}\,\displaystyle{\frac{d_id_j}{d^2_i+d^2_j}},$$ where $d_i$ is the degree of the vertex $v_i$ in $G$. In this paper, we obtain some lower and upper bounds on the inverse symmetric division deg index $(ISDD)$ of graphs in terms of various graph parameters, with identifying extremal graphs. Moreover, we present two relations between the Inverse symmetric division deg index and the various topological indices of graphs. Finally, we give concluding remarks with future work.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of labeled trees and Dyck tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a partially ordered set of planar labeled rooted trees by use of combinatorial objects called Dyck tilings. A generating function of the poset is factorized when the minimum element of the poset is $312$-avoiding and satisfies some extra condition. We define a cover relation on rational Dyck tilings by that of labeled trees, and show that increasing and decreasing labelings are dual to each other. We consider two decompositions of a rational $(a,b)$-Dyck tiling: one is into $ab$ Dyck tilings and the other is into $a$ $(1,b)$-Dyck tilings. In the first case, we show that the weight of the $(a,b)$-Dyck tiling is the sum of the weights of $ab$ Dyck tilings. In the second case, we introduce a cover relation on $(1,b)$-Dyck tilings and obtain a poset of $(a,b)$-Dyck tilings by this decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-edge geodetic graph if every edge of $G$ lies in at least one geodesic of length $k$. We studied some basic properties of $k$-edge geodetic graphs. We investigated the $k$ edge-geodeticity of complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ and provide the minimum number of largest fixed order path that can cover $K_{m,n}$. We also studied the $k$-edge geodeticity of tree and the product graphs like Cartesian product, Strong product, Corona product, and provide the bounds for the minimum number of the largest fixed order path that can cover the graph.</description>

      <title>Triangle-free Graphs with Large Minimum Common Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. For $x\in V(G)$, let $N(x)=\{y\in V(G)\colon xy\in E(G)\}$. The minimum common degree of $G$, denoted by $\delta_{2}(G)$, is defined as the minimum of $|N(x)\cap N(y)|$ over all non-edges $xy$ of $G$. In 1982, H\"{a}ggkvist showed that every triangle-free graph with minimum degree greater than $\lfloor\frac{3n}{8}\rfloor$ is homomorphic to a cycle of length 5. In this paper, we prove that every triangle-free graph with minimum common degree greater than $\lfloor\frac{n}{8}\rfloor$ is homomorphic to a cycle of length 5, which implies H\"{a}ggkvist's result. The balanced blow-up of the M\"{o}bius ladder graph shows that it is best possible.</description>

      <title>Mixing on Generalized Associahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eppstein and Frishberg recently proved that the mixing time for the simple random walk on the $1$-skeleton of the associahedron is $O(n^3\log^3 n)$. We obtain similar rapid mixing results for the simple random walks on the $1$-skeleta of the type-$B$ and type-$D$ associahedra. We adapt Eppstein and Frishberg's technique to obtain the same bound of $O(n^3\log^3 n)$ in type $B$ and a bound of $O(n^{13} \log^2 n)$ in type $D$; in the process, we establish an expansion bound that is tight up to logarithmic factors in type $B$.</description>

Abstract: Bollob\'as-type theorem determines the maximum cardinality of a Bollob\'as system of sets. The original result has been extended to various mathematical structures beyond sets, including vector spaces and affine spaces. This paper generalizes the Bollob\'as-type theorem to singular linear spaces, and determine the maximum cardinality of (skew) Bollob\'as systems on them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the strong zero-divisor graph of a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring. We determine the condition on a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring (in terms of the smallest central projection in a lattice of central projections of a $*$-ring), so that its strong zero-divisor graph contains a cut vertex. It is proved that the set of cut vertices of a strong zero-divisor graph of a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring forms a complete subgraph. We prove that the complement of the strong zero-divisor graph of a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring is connected if and only if the $*$-ring contains at least six central projections. We characterize the diameter and girth of the complement of a strong zero-divisor graph of a p.q.-Baer $*$-ring. Also, we characterize p.q.-Baer $*$-rings whose strong zero-divisor graph is complemented.</description>

      <title>On a family of universal cycles for multi-dimensional permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal cycle (u-cycle) for permutations of length $n$ is a cyclic word, any size $n$ window of which is order-isomorphic to exactly one permutation of length $n$, and all permutations of length $n$ are covered. It is known that u-cycles for permutations exist, and they have been considered in the literature in several papers from different points of view.
  In this paper, we show how to construct a family of u-cycles for multi-dimensional permutations, which is based on applying an appropriate greedy algorithm. Our construction is a generalisation of the greedy way by Gao et al. to construct u-cycles for permutations. We also note the existence of u-cycles for $d$-dimensional matrices.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we determine the minimum degree threshold of perfect matchings with high discrepancy in $r$-edge-colored $k$-uniform hypergraphs for all $k\geq 3$ and $r\geq 2$, thereby completing the investigation into discrepancies of perfect matchings that has recently attracted significant attention. Our approach identifies this discrepancy threshold with a novel family of multicolored uniform hypergraphs and reveals new phenomena not covered in previous studies. In particular, our results address a question of Balogh, Treglown and Z\'arate-Guer\'en concerning 3-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Proportion-Based Hypergraph Burning</title>

Abstract: Graph burning is a discrete process that models the spread of influence through a network using a fire as a proxy for the type of influence being spread. This process was recently extended to hypergraphs. We introduce a variant of hypergraph burning that uses an alternative propagation rule for how the fire spreads - if some fixed proportion of vertices are on fire in a hyperedge, then in the next round the entire hyperedge catches fire. This new variant has more potential for applications than the original model, and it is similarly viable for obtaining deep theoretical results. We obtain bounds which apply to general hypergraphs, and introduce the concept of the burning distribution, which describes how the model changes as the proportion ranges over (0,1). We also obtain computational results which suggest there is a strong correlation between the automorphism group order and the lazy burning number of a balanced incomplete block design.</description>

Abstract: High-order structures have been recognised as suitable models for systems going beyond the binary relationships for which graph models are appropriate. Despite their importance and surge in research on these structures, their random cases have been only recently become subjects of interest. One of these high-order structures is the oriented hypergraph, which relates couples of subsets of an arbitrary number of vertices. Here we develop the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model for oriented hypergraphs, which corresponds to the random realisation of oriented hyperedges of the complete oriented hypergraph. A particular feature of random oriented hypergraphs is that the ratio between their expected number of oriented hyperedges and their expected degree or size is 3/2 for large number of vertices. We highlight the suitability of oriented hypergraphs for modelling large collections of chemical reactions and the importance of random oriented hypergraphs to analyse the unfolding of chemistry.</description>

Abstract: We give a new construction of the model structure on the category of simplicial sets for homotopy $n$-types, originally due to Elvira-Donazar and Hernandez-Paricio, using a right transfer along the coskeleton functor. We observe that an analogous model structure can be constructed on the category of cubical sets, and use it to equip the category of (simple) graphs with a fibration category structure whose weak equivalences are discrete $n$-equivalences.</description>

      <title>Gromov's Approximating Tree and the All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pointed metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}, w)$ on $n$ points, its Gromov's approximating tree is a 0-hyperbolic pseudo-metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}_T)$ such that $\mathsf{dist}(x,w)=\mathsf{dist}_T(x,w)$ and $\mathsf{dist}(x, y)-2 \delta \log_2n \leq \mathsf{dist}_T (x, y) \leq \mathsf{dist}(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$ where $\delta$ is the Gromov hyperbolicity of $X$. On the other hand, the all pairs bottleneck paths (APBP) problem asks, given an undirected graph with some capacities on its edges, to find the maximal path capacity between each pair of vertices. In this note, we prove:
  $\bullet$ Computing Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its matrix of distances reduces to solving the APBP problem on an connected graph with $n$ vertices.
  $\bullet$ There is an explicit algorithm that computes Gromov's approximating tree for a graph from its adjacency matrix in quadratic time.
  $\bullet$ Solving the APBP problem on a weighted graph with $n$ vertices reduces to finding Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its distance matrix.</description>

      <title>Branching with a pre-specified finite list of $k$-sparse split sets for binary MILPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When branching for binary mixed integer linear programs with disjunctions of sparsity level $2$, we observe that there exists a finite list of $2$-sparse disjunctions, such that any other $2$-sparse disjunction is dominated by one disjunction in this finite list. For sparsity level greater than $2$, we show that a finite list of disjunctions with this property cannot exist. This leads to the definition of covering number for a list of splits disjunctions. Given a finite list of split sets $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-sparsity, and a given $k$-sparse split set $S$, let $\mathcal{F}(S)$ be the minimum number of split sets from the list $\mathcal{F}$, whose union contains $S \cap [0, \ 1]^n$. Let the covering number of $\mathcal{F}$ be the maximum value of $\mathcal{F}(S)$ over all $k$-sparse split sets $S$. We show that the covering number for any finite list of $k$-sparse split sets is at least $\lfloor k/2\rfloor $ for $k \geq 4$. We also show that the covering number of the family of $k$-sparse split sets with coefficients in $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ is upper bounded by $k-1$ for $k \leq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct perfect t-embeddings for regular hexagons of the hexagonal lattice, providing the first example, and hence proving existence, for graphs with an outer face of degree greater than four. The construction is in terms of the inverse Kasteleyn matrix and relies only on symmetries of the graph. Using known formulas for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix, we derive exact contour integral formulas for these embeddings and their origami maps. Through steepest descent analysis, we establish scaling limits, proving convergence of origami maps to a maximal surface in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$, and we verify structural rigidity conditions, leading to a new proof of convergence of height fluctuations to the Gaussian free field.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that $G$ is a graph of cardinality $\mu^+$ with chromatic number $\chi(G)\geq \mu^+$. One possible reason that this could happen is if $G$ contains a clique of size $\mu^+$. We prove that this is indeed the case when the edge relation is stable. When $G$ is a random graph (which is simple but not stable), this is not true. But still if in general the complete theory of $G$ is simple, $G$ must contain finite cliques of unbounded sizes.</description>

      <title>The complexity of computing the period and the exponent of a digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The period of a strongly connected digraph is the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all its cycles. The period of a digraph is the least common multiple of the periods of its strongly connected components that contain at least one cycle. These notions play an important role in the theory of Markov chains and the analysis of powers of nonnegative matrices. While the time complexity of computing the period is well-understood, little is known about its space complexity. We show that the problem of computing the period of a digraph is NL-complete, even if all its cycles are contained in the same strongly connected component. However, if the digraph is strongly connected, we show that this problem becomes L-complete. For primitive digraphs (that is, strongly connected digraphs of period one), there always exists a number $m$ such that there is a path of length exactly $m$ between every two vertices. We show that computing the smallest such $m$, called the exponent of a digraph, is NL-complete. The exponent of a primitive digraph is a particular case of the index of convergence of a nonnegative matrix, which we also show to be computable in NL, and thus NL-complete.</description>

      <title>M\"obius inversion and the bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating nonlinear functionals of probability distributions from samples is a fundamental statistical problem. The "plug-in" estimator obtained by applying the target functional to the empirical distribution of samples is biased. Resampling methods such as the bootstrap derive artificial datasets from the original one by resampling. Comparing the outcome of the plug-in estimator in the original and resampled datasets allows estimating and thus correcting the bias. In the asymptotic setting, iterations of this procedure attain an arbitrarily high order of bias correction, but finite sample results are scarce. This work develops a new theoretical understanding of bootstrap bias correction by viewing it as an iterative linear solver for the combinatorial operation of M\"obius inversion. It sharply characterizes the regime of linear convergence of the bootstrap bias reduction for moment polynomials. It uses these results to show its superalgebraic convergence rate for band-limited functionals. Finally, it derives a modified bootstrap iteration enabling the unbiased estimation of unknown order-$m$ moment polynomials in $m$ bootstrap iterations.</description>

      <title>Crystallizations of small covers over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ and the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A small cover is a closed manifold $M^n$ with a locally standard $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-action such that its orbit space is a simple convex polytope $P^n$. In this article, we study the crystallizations of small covers over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ and the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$. It is known that the small cover over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is $\mathbb{RP}^n$. For every $n\geq 2$, we prove that $\mathbb{RP}^n$ has a unique $2^n$-vertex crystallization. We also demonstrate that there are exactly $1 + 2^{n-1}$ D-J equivalence classes of small covers over the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$, where $n\geq 3$. For each $\mathbb{Z}_2$-characteristic function of $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$, we construct a $2^{n-1}(n+1)$-vertex crystallization of the small cover $M^n(\lambda)$ with regular genus $1 + 2^{n-4}(n^2 - 2n - 3)$, where $n\geq 4$. In particular, we construct four orientable and four non-orientable $\mathbb{RP}^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{S}^1$ up to D-J equivalence with the regular genus 6.</description>

Abstract: A non-uniform and inhomogeneous random hypergraph model is considered, which is a straightforward extension of the celebrated binomial random graph model $\mathbb G(n, p)$. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for small hypergraph count to be asymptotically normal, and complement them with convergence rate in both the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov distances. Next we narrow our attention to the homogeneous model and relate the obtained results to the fourth moment phenomenon. Additionally, a short proof of necessity of aforementioned conditions is presented, which seems to be absent in the literature even in the context of the model $\mathbb G(n, p)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral sparsification and discrepancy minimization are two well-studied areas that are closely related. Building on recent connections between these two areas, we generalize the "deterministic discrepancy walk" framework by Pesenti and Vladu [SODA~23] for vector discrepancy to matrix discrepancy, and use it to give a simpler proof of the matrix partial coloring theorem of Reis and Rothvoss [SODA~20]. Moreover, we show that this matrix discrepancy framework provides a unified approach for various spectral sparsification problems, from stronger notions including unit-circle approximation and singular-value approximation to weaker notions including graphical spectral sketching and effective resistance sparsification. In all of these applications, our framework produces improved results with a simpler and deterministic analysis.</description>

Abstract: While there have been many results on lower bounds for Max Cut in unweighted graphs, there are only few results for lower bounds for Max Cut in weighted graphs. In this paper, we launch an extensive study of lower bounds for Max Cut in weighted graphs. We introduce a new approach for obtaining lower bounds for Weighted Max Cut. Using it, Probabilistic Method, Vizing's chromatic index theorem, and other tools, we obtain several lower bounds for arbitrary weighted graphs, weighted graphs of bounded girth and triangle-free weighted graphs. We pose conjectures and open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey's Theorem guarantees for every graph H that any 2-edge-coloring of a sufficiently large complete graph contains a monochromatic copy of H. In 1962, Erdos conjectured that the random 2-edge-coloring minimizes the number of monochromatic copies of K_k, and the conjecture was extended by Burr and Rosta to all graphs. In the late 1980s, the conjectures were disproved by Thomason and Sidorenko, respectively. A classification of graphs whose number of monochromatic copies is minimized by the random 2-edge-coloring, which are referred to as common graphs, remains a challenging open problem. If Sidorenko's Conjecture, one of the most significant open problems in extremal graph theory, is true, then every 2-chromatic graph is common, and in fact, no 2-chromatic common graph unsettled for Sidorenko's Conjecture is known. While examples of 3-chromatic common graphs were known for a long time, the existence of a 4-chromatic common graph was open until 2012, and no common graph with a larger chromatic number is known.
  We construct connected k-chromatic common graphs for every k. This answers a question posed by Hatami, Hladky, Kral, Norine and Razborov [Combin. Probab. Comput. 21 (2012), 734-742], and a problem listed by Conlon, Fox and Sudakov [London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser. 424 (2015), 49-118, Problem 2.28]. This also answers in a stronger form the question raised by Jagger, Stovicek and Thomason [Combinatorica 16, (1996), 123-131] whether there exists a common graph with chromatic number at least four.</description>

Abstract: The following question was asked by Prendiville: given an $r$-colouring of the interval $\{2, \dotsc, N\}$, what is the minimum number of monochromatic solutions of the equation $xy = z$? For $r=2$, we show that there are always asymptotically at least $(1/2\sqrt{2}) N^{1/2} \log N$ monochromatic solutions, and that the leading constant is sharp. For $r=3$ and $r=4$ we obtain tight results up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor. We also provide bounds for more colours and other multiplicative equations.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for patterns in random permutations with a given number of inversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how the asymptotic structure of a random permutation of $[n]$ with $m$ inversions evolves, as $m$ increases, establishing thresholds for the appearance and disappearance of any classical, consecutive or vincular pattern. The threshold for the appearance of a classical pattern depends on the greatest number of inversions in any of its sum indecomposable components.</description>

      <title>Chordal graphs, even-hole-free graphs and sparse obstructions to bounded treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01299v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and study the following conjecture: for an integer $t\geq 4$ and a graph $H$, every even-hole-free graph of large enough treewidth has an induced subgraph isomorphic to either $K_t$ or $H$, if (and only if) $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph. The ``only if'' part follows from the properties of the so-called layered wheels due to Sintiari and Trotignon.
  Alecu, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and the author recently proved the conjecture in two special cases: (a) when $t=4$; and (b) when $H=cone (F)$ for some forest $F$; that is, $H$ is obtained from $F$ by adding a universal vertex. Our first result is a common strengthening: for an integer $t\geq 4$ and graphs $F$ and $H$, (even-hole, $cone(cone (F))$, $H$, $K_t$)-free graphs have bounded treewidth if and only if $F$ is a forest and $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph.
  Also, for general $t\geq 4$, we push the current state of the art further than (b) by settling the conjecture for the smallest choices of $H$ that are not coned forests. This follows from our second result: we prove the conjecture when $H$ is a crystal; that is, a graph obtained from several coned double stars by gluing them together along the middle edges of the double stars.
  In the first version of this paper, we suggested a strengthening of our main conjecture, that for every $t\geq 1$, every graph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph of treewidth $t$ which is either complete, complete bipartite, or $2$-degenerate. This strengthening has now been refuted by Chudnovsky and Trotignon [On treewidth and maximum cliques, arXiv:2405.07471, 2024].</description>

      <title>Reconstructing almost all of a point set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ from randomly revealed pairwise distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and suppose that the distance between each pair of points is revealed independently with probability $p$. We study when this information is sufficient to reconstruct large subsets of $V$, up to isometry.
  Strong results for $d=1$ have been obtained by Gir\~ao, Illingworth, Michel, Powierski, and Scott. In this paper, we investigate higher dimensions, and show that if $p&gt;n^{-2/(d+4)}$, then we can reconstruct almost all of $V$ up to isometry, with high probability. We do this by relating it to a polluted graph bootstrap percolation result, for which we adapt the methods of Balogh, Bollob\'as, and Morris.</description>

      <title>New scattered linearized quadrinomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14742v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $1&lt;t&lt;n$ be integers, where $t$ is a divisor of $n$. An R-$q^t$-partially scattered polynomial is a $\mathbb F_q$-linearized polynomial $f$ in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ that satisfies the condition that for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ such that $x/y\in\mathbb F_{q^t}$, if $f(x)/x=f(y)/y$, then $x/y\in\mathbb F_q$; $f$ is called scattered if this implication holds for all $x,y\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$. Two polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are said to be equivalent if their graphs are in the same orbit under the action of the group $\Gamma L(2,q^n)$. For $n&gt;8$ only three families of scattered polynomials in $\mathbb F_{q^n}[X]$ are known: $(i)$~monomials of pseudoregulus type, $(ii)$~binomials of Lunardon-Polverino type, and $(iii)$~a family of quadrinomials defined in [1,10] and extended in [8,13]. In this paper we prove that the polynomial $\varphi_{m,q^J}=X^{q^{J(t-1)}}+X^{q^{J(2t-1)}}+m(X^{q^J}-X^{q^{J(t+1)}})\in\mathbb F_{q^{2t}}[X]$, $q$ odd, $t\ge3$ is R-$q^t$-partially scattered for every value of $m\in\mathbb F_{q^t}^*$ and $J$ coprime with $2t$. Moreover, for every $t&gt;4$ and $q&gt;5$ there exist values of $m$ for which $\varphi_{m,q}$ is scattered and new with respect to the polynomials mentioned in $(i)$, $(ii)$ and $(iii)$ above. The related linear sets are of $\Gamma L$-class at least two.</description>

Abstract: In this survey we revisit {\sc finite subtraction}, one-heap subtraction games on finite rulesets. The main purpose is to give a general overview of the development, and specifically to draw attention to Flammenkamp's thesis (1997), where he, contrary to other studies, experimentally observes exponential eventual period length of the outcomes, for a carefully selected subclass of games. In addition, we contribute an appendix on {\sc finite excluded subtraction} by Suetsugu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say a finite word $x$ is a palindromic periodicity if there exist two palindromes $p$ and $s$ such that $|x| \geq |ps|$ and $x$ is a prefix of the word $(ps)^\omega = pspsps\cdots$. In this paper we examine the palindromic periodicities occurring in some classical infinite words, such as Sturmian words, episturmian words, the Thue-Morse word, the period-doubling word, the Rudin-Shapiro word, the paperfolding word, and the Tribonacci word, and prove a number of results about them. We also prove results about words with the smallest number of palindromic periodicities.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>Lattice theory of torsion classes: Beyond $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.01785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish a lattice theoretical framework to study the partially ordered set $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ of torsion classes over a finite-dimensional algebra $A$. We show that $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ is a complete lattice which enjoys very strong properties, as bialgebraicity and complete semidistributivity. Thus its Hasse quiver carries the important part of its structure, and we introduce the brick labelling of its Hasse quiver and use it to study lattice congruences of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$. In particular, we give a representation-theoretical interpretation of the so-called forcing order, and we prove that $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ is completely congruence uniform. When $I$ is a two-sided ideal of $A$, $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} (A/I)$ is a lattice quotient of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ which is called an algebraic quotient, and the corresponding lattice congruence is called an algebraic congruence. The second part of this paper consists in studying algebraic congruences. We characterize the arrows of the Hasse quiver of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ that are contracted by an algebraic congruence in terms of the brick labelling. In the third part, we study in detail the case of preprojective algebras $\Pi$, for which $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \Pi$ is the Weyl group endowed with the weak order. In particular, we give a new, more representation theoretical proof of the isomorphism between $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} k Q$ and the Cambrian lattice when $Q$ is a Dynkin quiver. We also prove that, in type $A$, the algebraic quotients of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \Pi$ are exactly its Hasse-regular lattice quotients.</description>

Abstract: We give several characterizations of when a complete first-order theory $T$ is monadically NIP, i.e. when expansions of $T$ by arbitrary unary predicates do not have the independence property. The central characterization is a condition on finite satisfiability of types. Other characterizations include decompositions of models, the behavior of indiscernibles, and a forbidden configuration. As an application, we prove non-structure results for hereditary classes of finite substructures of non-monadically NIP models that eliminate quantifiers.</description>

Abstract: We answer a question of Bardakov (Kourovka Notebook, Problem 19.8) which asks for the existence of a pair of natural numbers $(c, m)$ with the property that every element in the free group on the two-element set $\{a, b\}$ can be represented as a concatenation of $c$, or fewer, $m$-almost-palindromes in letters $a^{\pm 1}, b^{\pm 1}$. Here, an $m$-almost-palindrome is a word which can be obtained from a palindrome by changing at most $m$ letters. We show that no such pair $(c, m)$ exists. In fact, we show that the analogous result holds for all non-abelian free groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the abstract notion of a \emph{smoothable fine compactified Jacobian} of a nodal curve, and of a family of nodal curves whose general element is smooth. Then we introduce the notion of a combinatorial stability condition for line bundles and their degenerations. We prove that smoothable fine compactified Jacobians are in bijection with these stability conditions. We then turn our attention to \emph{fine compactified universal Jacobians}, that is, fine compactified Jacobians for the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_g$ of stable curves (without marked points). We prove that every fine compactified universal Jacobian is isomorphic to the one first constructed by Caporaso, Pandharipande and Simpson in the nineties. In particular, without marked points, there exists no fine compactified universal Jacobian unless $\gcd(d+1-g, 2g-2)=1$.</description>

      <title>Generalized GM-MDS: Polynomial Codes are Higher Order MDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GM-MDS theorem, conjectured by Dau-Song-Dong-Yuen and proved by Lovett and Yildiz-Hassibi, shows that the generator matrices of Reed-Solomon codes can attain every possible configuration of zeros for an MDS code. The recently emerging theory of higher order MDS codes has connected the GM-MDS theorem to other important properties of Reed-Solomon codes, including showing that Reed-Solomon codes can achieve list decoding capacity, even over fields of size linear in the message length.
  A few works have extended the GM-MDS theorem to other families of codes, including Gabidulin and skew polynomial codes. In this paper, we generalize all these previous results by showing that the GM-MDS theorem applies to any polynomial code, i.e., a code where the columns of the generator matrix are obtained by evaluating linearly independent polynomials at different points. We also show that the GM-MDS theorem applies to dual codes of such polynomial codes, which is non-trivial since the dual of a polynomial code may not be a polynomial code. More generally, we show that GM-MDS theorem also holds for algebraic codes (and their duals) where columns of the generator matrix are chosen to be points on some irreducible variety which is not contained in a hyperplane through the origin. Our generalization has applications to constructing capacity-achieving list-decodable codes as shown in a follow-up work by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi-Zhang, where it is proved that randomly punctured algebraic-geometric (AG) codes achieve list-decoding capacity over constant-sized fields.</description>

Abstract: We derive an asymptotic formula for the number of solutions in a given subfield to certain system of equations over finite fields. As an application, we construct new families of maximal cliques in generalized Paley graphs. Given integers $d\ge2$ and $q \equiv 1 \pmod d$, we show that for each positive integer $m$ such that $\operatorname{rad}(m) \mid \operatorname{rad}(d)$, there are maximal cliques of size approximately $q/m$ in the $d$-Paley graph defined on $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. We also confirm a conjecture of Goryainov, Shalaginov, and the second author on the maximality of certain cliques in generalized Paley graphs, as well as an analogous conjecture of Goryainov for Peisert graphs.</description>

Abstract: We describe the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) for a cyclic group when $p|N$ by factoring $x^N-1$ over finite fields and constructing the Fourier transform and its inverse using B\'{e}zout's identity for polynomials. For the symmetric group, in the modular case when $p|n!$ we construct the Peirce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents, yielding a change-of-basis matrix which generalizes the DFT. We compute the unitary DFT for the symmetric group over number fields containing sufficiently many square roots. For $n=3$, we compute the Galois group of the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial. All constructions are implemented in SageMath.</description>

      <title>Co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups</title>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. Associate a graph $\mathcal{E}_G$ (called the co-Engel graph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $[x, {}_k y] \neq 1$ and $[y, {}_k x] \neq 1$ for all positive integer $k$. This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was introduced by Abdollahi. Let $L(G)$ be the set of all left Engel elements of $G$. In this paper, we realize the induced subgraph of co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups $G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We write $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ to denote the subgraph of $\mathcal{E}_G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We also compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb indices of $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ for those groups. As a consequence, we determine (up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number is at most $4$ and $\mathcal{E}^-$ is toroidal or projective. Further, we show that $\coeng{G}$ is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the Hansen--Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Exceptional sets for length under restricted families of projections onto lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ is a Borel set of Hausdorff dimension $\dim A&gt;1$, and if $\rho_{\theta}$ is orthogonal projection to the line spanned by $( \cos \theta, \sin \theta, 1 )$, then $\rho_{\theta}(A)$ has positive length for all $\theta$ outside a set of Hausdorff dimension at most $\frac{3-\dim A}{2}$.</description>
