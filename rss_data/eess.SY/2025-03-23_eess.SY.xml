      <title>Prospects for endurance augmentation of small unmanned systems using butane-fueled thermoelectric generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of enhancing small (&lt;20 kg) drone endurance by exploiting the high energy density of hydrocarbons using a prototype generator based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) thermoelectric energy conversion technology. A proof-of-concept prototype was developed to vet design and engineering challenges and to bolster validity of resultant conclusions. The combination of the prototype performance and modeling suggests that endurance augmentation remains a difficult technical challenge with no clear immediate remedy despite many expectant alternatives. Across a sample of representative drones including ground- and air-based, multicopter and fixed wing drones, we report the following: from their current maximum values of 12%, thermoelectric (TE) generator module efficiencies must increase by over two times to achieve endurance parity with lithium batteries for VTOL multicopters. On the other hand, current TE efficiencies can compete with lithium batteries for some low power fixed wing and ground-based drones. Technical contributors for these results include weight of non-energy contributing components, low specific power and the associated tradeoff between specific power and specific energy due to fuel mass fraction, and lastly, low efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Distributed Consensus Optimization with Consensus ALADIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TThe paper proposes the Consensus Augmented Lagrange Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (Consensus ALADIN) algorithm, a novel approach for solving distributed consensus optimization problems (DC). Consensus ALADIN allows each agent to independently solve its own nonlinear programming problem while coordinating with other agents by solving a consensus quadratic programming (QP) problem. Building on this, we propose Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) Consensus ALADIN, a communication-and-computation-efficient Consensus ALADIN.BFGS Consensus ALADIN improves communication efficiency through BFGS approximation techniques and enhances computational efficiency by deriving a closed form for the consensus QP problem. Additionally, by replacing the BFGS approximation with a scaled identity matrix, we develop Reduced Consensus ALADIN, a more computationally efficient variant. We establish the convergence theory for Consensus ALADIN and demonstrate its effectiveness through application to a non-convex sensor allocation problem.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Linear Systems under Partial Observability: Sample Complexity and Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of stabilizing an unknown partially observable linear time-invariant (LTI) system. For fully observable systems, leveraging an unstable/stable subspace decomposition approach, state-of-art sample complexity is independent from system dimension $n$ and only scales with respect to the dimension of the unstable subspace. However, it remains open whether such sample complexity can be achieved for partially observable systems because such systems do not admit a uniquely identifiable unstable subspace. In this paper, we propose LTS-P, a novel technique that leverages compressed singular value decomposition (SVD) on the ''lifted'' Hankel matrix to estimate the unstable subsystem up to an unknown transformation. Then, we design a stabilizing controller that integrates a robust stabilizing controller for the unstable mode and a small-gain-type assumption on the stable subspace. We show that LTS-P stabilizes unknown partially observable LTI systems with state-of-the-art sample complexity that is dimension-free and only scales with the number of unstable modes, which significantly reduces data requirements for high-dimensional systems with many stable modes.</description>

      <title>System Identification Under Bounded Noise: Optimal Rates Beyond Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System identification is a fundamental problem in control and learning, particularly in high-stakes applications where data efficiency is critical. Classical approaches, such as the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate under Gaussian noise assumptions, where $T$ is the number of samples. This rate has been shown to match the lower bound. However, in many practical scenarios, noise is known to be bounded, opening the possibility of improving sample complexity. In this work, we establish the minimax lower bound for system identification under bounded noise, proving that the $O(1/T)$ convergence rate is indeed optimal. We further demonstrate that OLS remains limited to an {$\Omega(1/\sqrt{T})$} convergence rate, making it fundamentally suboptimal in the presence of bounded noise. Finally, we instantiate two natural variations of OLS that obtain the optimal sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Safe On-Orbit Dislodging of Deployable Structures via Robust Adaptive MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel robust adaptive model predictive controller for on-orbit dislodging. We consider the scenario where a servicer, equipped with a robot arm, must dislodge a client, a time-varying system composed of an underpowered jammed solar panel with a hybrid hinge system on a space station. Our approach leverages online set-membership identification to reduce the uncertainty to provide robust safety guarantees during dislodging despite bounded disturbances while balancing exploration and exploitation effectively in the parameter space. The feasibility of the developed robust adaptive MPC method is also examined through dislodging simulations and hardware experiments in zero-gravity and gravity environments, respectively. In addition, the advantages of our method are shown through comparison experiments with several state-of-the-art control schemes for both accuracy of parameter estimation and control performance.</description>

      <title>Throughput Maximizing Takeoff Scheduling for eVTOL Vehicles in On-Demand Urban Air Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by using electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles to provide on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand scenarios. In this paper, we present a centralized framework for conflict-free takeoff scheduling of eVTOLs in on-demand UAM systems. Specifically, we provide a scheduling policy, called VertiSync, which jointly schedules UAM vehicles for servicing trip requests and rebalancing, subject to safety margins and energy requirements. We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the demand threshold at which the average waiting time transitions from being stable to being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy maximizes throughput for sufficiently large fleet size and if the UAM network has a certain symmetry property. We demonstrate the performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles, and show that it significantly reduces average passenger waiting time compared to a first-come first-serve scheduling policy.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Testing of Foreseeable Misuse by the Driver applicable for Highly Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With Highly Automated Driving (HAD), the driver can engage in non-driving-related tasks. In the event of a system failure, the driver is expected to reasonably regain control of the Automated Vehicle (AV). Incorrect system understanding may provoke misuse by the driver and can lead to vehicle-level hazards. ISO 21448, referred to as the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF), defines misuse as usage of the system by the driver in a way not intended by the system manufacturer. Foreseeable Misuse (FM) implies anticipated system misuse based on the best knowledge about the system design and the driver behaviour. This is the underlying motivation to propose simulation-based testing of FM. The vital challenge is to perform a simulation-based testing for a SOTIF-related misuse scenario. Transverse Guidance Assist System (TGAS) is modelled for HAD. In the context of this publication, TGAS is referred to as the "system," and the driver is the human operator of the system. This publication focuses on implementing the Driver-Vehicle Interface (DVI) that permits the interactions between the driver and the system. The implementation and testing of a derived misuse scenario using the driving simulator ensure reasonable usage of the system by supporting the driver with unambiguous information on system functions and states so that the driver can conveniently perceive, comprehend, and act upon the information.</description>

      <title>CoIn-SafeLink: Safety-critical Control With Cost-sensitive Incremental Random Vector Functional Link Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) play a crucial role in achieving the safety-critical control of robotic systems theoretically. However, most existing methods rely on the analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which is often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. In this paper, a novel CBF construction approach, called CoIn-SafeLink, is proposed based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing an appropriate cost function, CoIn-SafeLink achieves differentiated sensitivities to safe and unsafe samples, effectively achieving zero false-negative risk in unsafe sample classification. Additionally, an incremental update theorem for CoIn-SafeLink is proposed, enabling precise adjustments in response to changes in the unsafe region. Finally, the gradient analytical expression of the CoIn-SafeLink is provided to calculate the control input. The proposed method is validated on a 3-degree-of-freedom drone attitude control system. Experimental results demonstrate that the method can effectively learn the unsafe region boundaries and rapidly adapt as these regions evolve, with an update speed approximately five times faster than comparison methods.

      <title>SoK: Trusted Execution in SoC-FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged at the forefront of edge computing to combat the lack of trust between system components. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are commonly used as edge computers but were not created with security as a primary consideration. Thus, FPGA-based edge computers are increasingly the target of cyberattacks. We analyze the existing literature to systematize the applications and features of FPGA-based TEEs. We identified 27 primary studies related to different types of System-on-Chip FPGA-based TEEs. Across a wide range of applications and features, the availability of extensible solutions is limited. Most solutions focus on specific features and applications, whereas few solutions focus on feature-rich, comprehensive TEEs that can be utilized across computer systems. Whether TEEs are specific or extensible, the paucity of published studies provides evidence of research gaps. This SoK delineates these gaps revealing opportunities for researchers and developers.</description>

      <title>Subgradient Method for System Identification with Non-Smooth Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a subgradient-based algorithm to solve the system identification problem for linear time-invariant systems with non-smooth objectives. This is essential for robust system identification in safety-critical applications. While existing work provides theoretical exact recovery guarantees using optimization solvers, the design of fast learning algorithms with convergence guarantees for practical use remains unexplored. We analyze the subgradient method in this setting where the optimization problems to be solved change over time as new measurements are taken, and we establish linear convergence results for both the best and Polyak step sizes after a burn-in period. Additionally, we characterize the asymptotic convergence of the best average sub-optimality gap under diminishing and constant step sizes. Finally, we compare the time complexity of standard solvers with the subgradient algorithm and support our findings with experimental results. This is the first work to analyze subgradient algorithms for system identification with non-smooth objectives.</description>

      <title>Deep Q-Learning with Gradient Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel reinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target update mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In the standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online network's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being periodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by providing consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update period must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric gradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target tracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates with continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which effectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings. Additionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard DQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an effective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Ground and Flight Locomotion for Two-Wheeled Drones via Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to motion planning for two-wheeled drones that can drive on the ground and fly in the air. Conventional methods for two-wheeled drone motion planning typically rely on gradient-based optimization and assume that obstacle shapes can be approximated by a differentiable form. To overcome this limitation, we propose a motion planning method based on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, enabling navigation through arbitrarily shaped obstacles by switching between driving and flight modes. To handle the instability and rapid solution changes caused by mode switching, our proposed method switches the control space and utilizes the auxiliary controller for MPPI. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enables navigation in unstructured environments and achieves effective obstacle avoidance through mode switching.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep B-Spline Networks for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning provides an approach to combining data and governing physics laws for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, efficiently solving PDEs with varying parameters and changing initial conditions and boundary conditions (ICBCs) with theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. We propose a hybrid framework that uses a neural network to learn B-spline control points to approximate solutions to PDEs with varying system and ICBC parameters. The proposed network can be trained efficiently as one can directly specify ICBCs without imposing losses, calculate physics-informed loss functions through analytical formulas, and requires only learning the weights of B-spline functions as opposed to both weights and basis as in traditional neural operator learning methods. We provide theoretical guarantees that the proposed B-spline networks serve as universal approximators for the set of solutions of PDEs with varying ICBCs under mild conditions and establish bounds on the generalization errors in physics-informed learning. We also demonstrate in experiments that the proposed B-spline network can solve problems with discontinuous ICBCs and outperforms existing methods, and is able to learn solutions of 3D dynamics with diverse initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Federated Digital Twin Construction via Distributed Sensing: A Game-Theoretic Online Optimization with Overlapping Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel federated framework for constructing the digital twin (DT) model, referring to a living and self-evolving visualization model empowered by artificial intelligence, enabled by distributed sensing under edge-cloud collaboration. In this framework, the DT model to be built at the cloud is regarded as a global one being split into and integrating from multiple functional components, i.e., partial-DTs, created at various edge servers (ESs) using feature data collected by associated sensors. Considering time-varying DT evolutions and heterogeneities among partial-DTs, we formulate an online problem that jointly and dynamically optimizes partial-DT assignments from the cloud to ESs, ES-sensor associations for partial-DT creation, and as well as computation and communication resource allocations for global-DT integration. The problem aims to maximize the constructed DT's model quality while minimizing all induced costs, including energy consumption and configuration costs, in long runs. To this end, we first transform the original problem into an equivalent hierarchical game with an upper-layer two-sided matching game and a lower-layer overlapping coalition formation game. After analyzing these games in detail, we apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm and particularly develop a switch rules-based overlapping coalition formation algorithm to obtain short-term equilibria of upper-layer and lower-layer subgames, respectively. Then, we design a deep reinforcement learning-based solution, called DMO, to extend the result into a long-term equilibrium of the hierarchical game, thereby producing the solution to the original problem. Simulations show the effectiveness of the introduced framework, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over counterparts.</description>

      <title>One-Point Residual Feedback Algorithms for Distributed Online Convex and Non-convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper mainly addresses the distributed online optimization problem where the local objective functions are assumed to be convex or non-convex. First, the distributed algorithms are proposed for the convex and non-convex situations, where the one-point residual feedback technology is introduced to estimate gradient of local objective functions. Then the regret bounds of the proposed algorithms are derived respectively under the assumption that the local objective functions are Lipschitz or smooth, which implies that the regrets are sublinear. Finally, we give two numerical examples of distributed convex optimization and distributed resources allocation problem to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Reachability-Guaranteed Optimal Control for the Interception of Dynamic Targets under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intercepting dynamic objects in uncertain environments involves a significant unresolved challenge in modern robotic systems. Current control approaches rely solely on estimated information, and results lack guarantees of robustness and feasibility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to tackle the interception of targets whose motion is affected by known and bounded uncertainty. Our approach introduces new techniques of reachability analysis for rigid bodies, leveraged to guarantee feasibility of interception under uncertain conditions. We then propose a Reachability-Guaranteed Optimal Control Problem, ensuring robustness and guaranteed reachability to a target set of configurations. We demonstrate the methodology in the case study of an interception maneuver of a tumbling target in space.</description>

      <title>EVSOAR: Security Orchestration, Automation and Response via EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, driven by the innovation in the automotive industry, e.g., automomous, electric, or connnected vehicles. Current efforts to address these challenges are constrained by the limited computational resources of vehicles and the reliance on connected infrastructures. This motivated the foundation of Vehicle Security Operations Centers (VSOCs) that extend IT-based Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to cover the entire automotive ecosystem, both the in-vehicle and off-vehicle scopes. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools are considered key for impelementing an effective cybersecurity solution. However, existing state-of-the-art solutions depend on infrastructure networks such as 4G, 5G, and WiFi, which often face scalability and congestion issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel SOAR architecture EVSOAR that leverages the EV charging stations for connectivity and computing to enhance vehicle cybersecurity. Our EV-specific SOAR architecture enables real-time analysis and automated responses to cybersecurity threats closer to the EV, reducing the cellular latency, bandwidth, and interference limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in latency, stability, and scalability through the infrastructure and the capacity to deploy computationally intensive applications, that are otherwise infeasible within the resource constraints of individual vehicles.</description>

      <title>GraFIT: A toolbox for fast and accurate frequency response identification in Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency response function (FRF) measurements are widely used in Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors, e.g., for the design of controllers, calibrating signals and diagnostic problems with system dynamics. The aim of this paper is to present GraFIT: a toolbox that enables fast, inexpensive, and accurate identification of FRF measurements for GW detectors compared to the commonly used approaches, including common spectral analysis techniques. The toolbox consists of a single function to estimate the frequency response function for both open-loop and closed-loop systems and for arbitrary input and output dimensions. The toolbox is validated on two experimental case studies of the Virgo detector, illustrating more than a factor 3 reduction in standard deviation of the estimate for the same measurement times, and comparable standard deviations with up to 10 times less data for the new method with respect to the currently implemented Spectral Analysis method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment Portfolio of Thyristor- and IGBT-based Electrolysis Rectifiers in Utility-scale Renewable P2H Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems require rectifiers to supply power to electrolyzers (ELZs). Two main types of rectifiers, insulated-gate bipolar transistor rectifiers (IGBT-Rs) and thyristor rectifiers (TRs), offer distinct tradeoffs. IGBT-Rs provide flexible reactive power control but are costly, whereas TRs are more affordable with lower power loss but consume a large amount of uncontrollable reactive power. A mixed configuration of rectifiers in utility-scale ReP2H systems could achieve an decent tradeoff and increase overall profitability. To explore this potential, this paper proposes an optimal investment portfolio model. First, we model and compare the active and reactive power characteristics of ELZs powered by TRs and IGBT-Rs. Second, we consider the investment of ELZs, rectifiers, and var resources and coordinate the operation of renewables, energy storage, var resources, and the on-off switching and load allocation of multiple ELZs. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model based on weighted information gap decision theory (W-IGDT) is developed to address the uncertainties of the renewable power and hydrogen price, and we apply the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm to accelerate its solution. Case studies demonstrate that optimal rectifier configurations increase revenue by at most 2.56% compared with using only TRs or IGBT-Rs, as well as those in existing projects. Under the optimal portfolio, reactive power compensation investment is nearly eliminated, with a preferred TR-to-IGBT-R ratio of 3:1.</description>

      <title>Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Guidance for Target Tracking subject to Intermittent Measurements using Motion Model Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel guidance law for target tracking applications where the target motion model is unknown and sensor measurements are intermittent due to unknown environmental conditions and low measurement update rate. In this work, the target motion model is represented by a transformer neural network and trained by previous target position measurements. This transformer motion model serves as the prediction step in a particle filter for target state estimation and uncertainty quantification. The particle filter estimation uncertainty is utilized in the information-driven guidance law to compute a path for the mobile agent to travel to a position with maximum expected entropy reduction (EER). The computation of EER is performed in real-time by approximating the information gain from the predicted particle distributions relative to the current distribution. Simulation and hardware experiments are performed with a quadcopter agent and TurtleBot target to demonstrate that the presented guidance law outperforms two other baseline guidance methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of MPC for tracking using ADMM by decoupling its semi-banded structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) for tracking formulation presents numerous advantages compared to standard MPC, such as a larger domain of attraction and recursive feasibility even when abrupt changes in the reference are produced. As a drawback, it includes some extra decision variables in its related optimization problem, leading to a semi-banded structure that differs from the banded structure encountered in standard MPC. This semi-banded structure prevents the direct use of the efficient algorithms available for banded problems. To address this issue, we present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers that explicitly takes advantage of the underlying semi-banded structure of the MPC for tracking.</description>

      <title>Set-membership target search and tracking within an unknown cluttered area using cooperating UAVs equipped with vision systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of target search and tracking using a fleet of cooperating UAVs evolving in some unknown region of interest containing an a priori unknown number of moving ground targets. Each drone is equipped with an embedded Computer Vision System (CVS), providing an image with labeled pixels and a depth map of the observed part of its environment. Moreover, a box containing the corresponding pixels in the image frame is available when a UAV identifies a target. Hypotheses regarding information provided by the pixel classification, depth map construction, and target identification algorithms are proposed to allow its exploitation by set-membership approaches. A set-membership target location estimator is developed using the information provided by the CVS. Each UAV evaluates sets guaranteed to contain the location of the identified targets and a set possibly containing the locations of targets still to be identified. Then, each UAV uses these sets to search and track targets cooperatively.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Waveform Generated Metasurface: A New Paradigm for Direct Modulation and Beamforming Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04544v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information Metasurface, also known as reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has gained significant attention owing to its impressive abilities in electromagnetic (EM) wave manipulation with simple structures. Numerous studies focus on achieving efficient and versatile information transmission using RIS across various fields like wireless communication, radar detection, integrated sensing, and communications, among others. Previous studies demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve reflection modulation by utilizing the superposition of the quantified reflection coefficient (RC) of each unit but suffer from the computing complexity of codebook sequence, the safety of communication, and the flexibility of modulation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel concept of information metasurface, namely AWG-RIS, which is capable of independently producing arbitrary baseband waveforms and beam patterns through a design that decouples magnitude and phase, without changing the beam pattern. The AWG-RIS functions as a reflection mixer, directly embedding the intended signal into the incoming EM waves. Subsequently, we developed an analysis framework and introduced the waveform factor and beamforming factor into the new model, offering theoretical support for the transition from the control signal to the outgoing electromagnetic wave. Additionally, we unveil the world's first prototype showcasing passive arbitrary waveform generation while maintaining the beam pattern unaltered. Leveraging the decoupling of direct modulation and beamforming, we explore additional applications in several domains relative to traditional RISs. Finally, we present experiments that confirm the generation of arbitrary waveforms and particular spectrograms.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the sparse actuation problem for nonlinear systems represented in the Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. We propose a convex optimization framework that concurrently determines actuator magnitude limits and the state-feedback law that guarantees a user-specified closed-loop performance in the $\mathcal{H}_2/\mathcal{H}_\infty$ sense. We also demonstrate that sparse actuation is achieved when the actuator magnitude-limits are minimized in the $l_1$ sense. This is the first paper that addresses this problem for LPV systems. The formulation is demonstrated in a vibration control problem for a flexible wing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework to model Formula 1 racing dynamics, where multiple cars interact physically and strategically. Aerodynamic wake effects, trajectory optimization, and energy management are integrated by means of physical models. We describe the minimum lap time problem with two agents as either a Nash or a Stackelberg game, and by employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions during the problem formulation, we recover the structure of a nonlinear program. In addition, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions, using the Nash costs as upper bounds. The resulting strategies are analyzed through case studies. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. Exploiting the structural similarities of the game formulations, we are able to compare symmetric and hierarchical strategies to analyze competitive racing dynamics. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals typical Formula 1 strategic behaviors. The proposed methodology closes the gap between theoretical game theory and real-world racing, with potential applications in motorsport engineering and autonomous racing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future surgical care demands real-time, integrated data to drive informed decision-making and improve patient outcomes. The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.</description>

Abstract: Ensuring liveness and safety of autonomous and cyber-physical systems remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when multiple safety constraints are present. This letter advances the theoretical foundations of safety-filter Quadratic Programs (QP) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF)-Control Barrier Function (CBF) controllers by establishing a unified analytical framework for studying their stability properties. We derive sufficient feasibility conditions for QPs with multiple CBFs and formally characterize the conditions leading to undesirable equilibrium points at possible intersecting safe set boundaries. Additionally, we introduce a stability criterion for equilibrium points, providing a systematic approach to identifying conditions under which they can be destabilized or eliminated. Our analysis extends prior theoretical results, deepening the understanding of the conditions of feasibility and stability of CBF-based safety filters and the CLF-CBF QP framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13479v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A faster response with commendable accuracy in intelligent systems is essential for the reliability and smooth operations of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of such intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and (ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100% for most of the operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Contraction Theory for Nonlinear Stability Analysis and Learning-based Control: A Tutorial Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.00675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contraction theory is an analytical tool to study differential dynamics of a non-autonomous (i.e., time-varying) nonlinear system under a contraction metric defined with a uniformly positive definite matrix, the existence of which results in a necessary and sufficient characterization of incremental exponential stability of multiple solution trajectories with respect to each other. By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit the systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is, therefore, to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery Guarantees for Parameterized Nonlinear System Identification Problem under Sparse Disturbances or Semi-Oblivious Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of learning a nonlinear dynamical system by parameterizing its dynamics using basis functions. We assume that disturbances occur at each time step with an arbitrary probability $p$, which models the sparsity level of the disturbance vectors over time. These disturbances are drawn from an arbitrary, unknown probability distribution, which may depend on past disturbances, provided that it satisfies a zero-mean assumption. The primary objective of this paper is to learn the system's dynamics within a finite time and analyze the sample complexity as a function of $p$. To achieve this, we examine a LASSO-type non-smooth estimator, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for its well-specifiedness and the uniqueness of the global solution to the underlying optimization problem. We then provide exact recovery guarantees for the estimator under two distinct conditions: boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of the basis functions. We show that finite-time exact recovery is achieved with high probability, even when $p$ approaches 1. Unlike prior works, which primarily focus on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) disturbances and provide only asymptotic guarantees for system learning, this study presents the first finite-time analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems under a highly general disturbance model. Our framework allows for possible temporal correlations in the disturbances and accommodates semi-oblivious adversarial attacks, significantly broadening the scope of existing theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Online Distributed Seeking for Generalized Nash Equilibrium of Nonmonotone Online Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper mainly investigates a class of distributed generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking problems for online nonmonotone game with time-varying coupling inequality constraints. Based on a time-varying control gain, a novel continuous-time distributed GNE seeking algorithm is proposed, which realizes the constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound, matching those of the criteria for online optimization problems. Furthermore, to reduce unnecessary communication among players, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism involving internal variables is introduced into the distributed GNE seeking algorithm, while the constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound are still achieved. Also, the Zeno behavior is strictly prohibited. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>SOUS VIDE: Cooking Visual Drone Navigation Policies in a Gaussian Splatting Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new simulator, training approach, and policy architecture, collectively called SOUS VIDE, for end-to-end visual drone navigation. Our trained policies exhibit zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with robust real-world performance using only onboard perception and computation. Our simulator, called FiGS, couples a computationally simple drone dynamics model with a high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting scene reconstruction. FiGS can quickly simulate drone flights producing photorealistic images at up to 130 fps. We use FiGS to collect 100k-300k image/state-action pairs from an expert MPC with privileged state and dynamics information, randomized over dynamics parameters and spatial disturbances. We then distill this expert MPC into an end-to-end visuomotor policy with a lightweight neural architecture, called SV-Net. SV-Net processes color image, optical flow and IMU data streams into low-level thrust and body rate commands at 20 Hz onboard a drone. Crucially, SV-Net includes a learned module for low-level control that adapts at runtime to variations in drone dynamics. In a campaign of 105 hardware experiments, we show SOUS VIDE policies to be robust to 30% mass variations, 40 m/s wind gusts, 60% changes in ambient brightness, shifting or removing objects from the scene, and people moving aggressively through the drone's visual field. Code, data, and experiment videos can be found on our project page: https://stanfordmsl.github.io/SousVide/.</description>
