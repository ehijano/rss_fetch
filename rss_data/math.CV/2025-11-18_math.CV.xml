      <title>Bohr phenomena for slice regular functions over Quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slice regular functions are a generalization of holomorphic functions to the setting of quaternions (and more generally, Clifford algebras). In this paper, we first establish the Bohr inequality for slice starlike functions and slice close-to-convex functions over quaternions $\mathbb{H}$. Next, we present a generalization of the Bohr inequality, and improved versions of the Bohr inequality for slice regular functions on the open unit ball $\mathbb{B}$ of $\mathbb{H}$. Finally, we provide a refined version of the Bohr inequality for slice regular functions $f$ on $\mathbb{B}$ such that $ {\rm Re}(f(q)) \leq 1 $ for all $q \in \mathbb{B}$. All the results are demonstrated to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Generating all Ahlfors currents by a single entire curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \(X\) be a compact complex manifold possessing the \emph{Runge approximation property on discs}, meaning that every holomorphic map from a closed disc into \(X\) is approximable by a global holomorphic map from \(\mathbb{C}\). We construct an entire curve \(F : \mathbb{C} \to X\) such that the associated family of concentric holomorphic discs \(\{F|_{\overline{\mathbb{D}}_r}\}_{r&gt;0}\) generates all Ahlfors currents on \(X\), thereby settling a conjecture of Sibony.</description>

      <title>Distribution of lengths of closed saddle connections on moduli space of large genus translation surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_g$ be a closed surface of genus $g$ and $\H_g$ be the moduli space of Abelian differentials on $S_g$. A stratum of $\H_g$, together with the Masur-Veech measure, becomes a probability space. Then the number of closed saddle connections with lengths in $[\frac{a}{\sqrt{g}},\frac{b}{\sqrt{g}}]$ on a random flat surface in the stratum is a random variable. We prove that when $g\to \infty$, the distribution of the random variable converges to a Poisson distributed random variable. This result answers a question of Masur, Rafi and Randecker.</description>

      <title>On cubic Blaschke products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every cubic Blaschke product has a unique hyperbolic inflection point in the unit disk and, moreover, this point lies at the hyperbolic midpoint of the two critical points. Using this structure result for cubic Blaschke products, we give an explicit expression in terms of the parameters which determines when cubic Blaschke products are elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>A neural optimization framework for free-boundary diffeomorphic mapping problems and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free-boundary diffeomorphism optimization is a core ingredient in the surface mapping problem but remains notoriously difficult because the boundary is unconstrained and local bijectivity must be preserved under large deformation. Numerical Least-Squares Quasiconformal (LSQC) theory, with its provable existence, uniqueness, similarity-invariance and resolution-independence, offers an elegant mathematical remedy. However, the conventional numerical algorithm requires landmark conditioning, and cannot be applied into gradient-based optimization. We propose a neural surrogate, the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), that embeds LSQC energy into a multiscale mesh-spectral architecture. Next, we propose the SBN guided optimization framework SBN-Opt which optimizes free-boundary diffeomorphism for the problem, with local geometric distortion explicitly controllable. Extensive experiments on density-equalizing maps and inconsistent surface registration demonstrate our SBN-Opt's superiority over traditional numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Grauert's direct image theorem via superconnections and desingularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new differential-geometric proof of Grauert's theorem on the coherence of the higher direct image of a coherent sheaf under a proper holomorphic morphism between complex analytic spaces. In the smooth case, our approach is based on the antiholomorphic superconnection introduced by Block and further developed by Bismut-Shen-Wei. The required finiteness results follow from elliptic theory. In the singular case, we reduce the problem to the smooth setting using Hironaka's desingularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study projectively flat holomorphic vector bundles over Riemann surfaces. To each such bundle, we naturally assign a Wronskian line bundle. The main idea is a notion of the division of two meromorphic sections. Abel's identity is interpreted as the first Chern class of the Wronskian line bundle.</description>

      <title>Exact holomorphic solution of the Hodge-dual minimal surface: a confining quantum QCD string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic solution for the quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in four dimensions, which provides a geometric fixed point of the Yang-Mills Wilson loop equation. The area of this surface is expressed through the eigenvalues of the Douglas-Gram matrix of the boundary loop, and is identical for the self-dual and anti-self-dual chiralities related by parity. We prove the Confinement Theorem by showing that the effective string tension sigma_eff[C] (ratio of our Hodge dual area to a Euclidean one bounded by the same loop) is bounded as sigma_eff[C]&gt;= sqrt(2) , remaining finite and positive for all regular loops. Consequently, the Wilson loop decays exponentially with the Euclidean area, providing a purely geometric proof of confinement. Quantization of the quadratic holomorphic action yields a quantum string, with a universal constant correction for each of the two chiral strings. The worldsheet theory is one-loop exact. This construction defines a solvable quantum Hodge-dual string theory reproducing the QCD area law with explicit tension dependence on the loop shape.</description>

      <title>Non-existence of a holomorphic embedding of the Sobolev loop space into the projective Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to understand the properties of meromorphic mappings with values in two model complex Hibert manifolds: projective Hilbert space $\pp(l^2)$ and Sobolev loop space of the Riemann sphere $L\pp^1$. It occurs that these properties are quite different. Based on our study we obtain as a corollary that $L\pp^1$ does not admit a closed holomorphic embedding to $\pp(l^2)$. In other words $L\pp^1$ is {\slsf not} a projective Hilbert variety despite of the fact that it is K\"ahler and meromorphic functions separate points on it. Moreover, we prove that $L\pp^1$ doesn't admit even a non-degenerate meromorphic map to $\pp (l^2)$.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna theory of the Hahn difference operators and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the version of Nevanlinna theory based on Hahn difference operator $\mathcal{D}_{q,c}(g)=\frac{g(qz+c)-g(z)}{(q-1)z+c}$ for meromorphic function of zero order in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. We first establish the logarithmic derivative lemma and the second fundamental theorem for the Hahn difference operator. Furthermore, the deficiency relation, Picard's theorem and the five-value theorem are extended to the setting of Hahn difference operators by applying the second fundamental theorem. Finally, we also consider the solutions of complex linear Hahn difference equations and Fermat type Hahn difference equations.</description>

      <title>Winding quotients for virtual period maps of rank 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We illustrate a rank 1 model of virtual period maps and their associated winding quotient, where the winding quotient is a new phenomenon appeared in a recent study of virtual period maps and it requires a reformulation of the classical inversion problem for the period maps. We answer to the new inversion problem by introducing the q-multiplicatively periodic function, whose pull-back to the winding covering space is the Weierstrass p-function up to a correction by Eisenstein series E2. The function appears also in the study of mathematical physics as the propagator on elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Commutation relations for two-sided radial SLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the commutation relation for 2-radial SLE in the unit disc starting from two boundary points. We follow the framework introduced by Dub\'{e}dat. Under an additional requirement of the interchangeability of the two curves, we classify all locally commuting 2-radial SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (0,8)$: it is either a two-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with spiral of constant spiraling rate or a chordal SLE$_\kappa$ weighted by a power of the conformal radius of its complement. Namely, for fixed $\kappa$ and starting points, we have exactly two one-parameter continuous families of locally commuting 2-radial SLE. Two-sided radial SLE with spiral is a generalization of two-sided radial SLE (without spiral) and satisfies the resampling property. We also discuss the semiclassical limit of the commutation relation as $\kappa \to 0$. In particular, we show that the limit for the second family with an appropriately chosen power of conformal radius is a chord that minimizes a modified chordal Loewner energy, which is unique only when the endpoints are not antipodal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the classes of holomorphic $p$-contact manifolds and holomorphic $s$-symplectic manifolds that generalise the classical holomorphic contact and holomorphic symplectic structures. After observing their basic properties and exhibiting a wide range of examples, we give two types of general conceptual results involving the former class of manifolds: structure theorems and unobstructedness theorems. The latter type generalises to our context the classical Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem for a type of small deformations of complex structures that generalise the small essential deformations previously introduced for the Iwasawa manifold and for Calabi-Yau page-$1$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclicity of Weighted shifts on weighted Bergman spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the continuity, and dynamical properties (hypercyclicity, periodic vectors, and chaos) for a weighted backward shift $B_w$ on a weighted Bergman space $A^p_{\phi}$ based on the norm estimates of coefficient functionals on $A^p_{\phi}$. Here, the weight function $\phi(z)$ is mostly radial, but our work will also involve a (non-radial) subharmonic weight. We provide a complete characterization of hypercyclic shifts $B_w$ on $A^p_{\phi}$ when $\phi$ is a radial weight. The coefficient multipliers obtained in this paper for certain weights are new.</description>

Abstract: We study double-sided actions of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ on $SL(3,\mathbb{C})/U$ and the associated quotients, where $U$ is a maximal unipotent subgroup of $SL(3,\mathbb{C})$. The main results of this paper are a sufficient condition for the double-sided quotient to agree with the quotient in terms of the geometric invariant theory (GIT), and an explicit necessary and sufficient condition for $SL(3,\mathbb{C})/U$ to agree with the $\chi$-stable locus in its affine closure. We apply this result to characterize certain complex structures on $SU(3)$ which are not left invariant by means of the GIT quotient.</description>
