      <title>Sturm-Liouville problems on graphs with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study characteristic functions and describe asymptotics of the eigenvalues for the spectral Sturm-Liouville problem on graphs equipped with Robin-Kirhhoff boundary conditions. Also, we show how to recover the coefficients in the Robin conditions for the quantum graphs provided the shape of the graphs and some Robin eigenvalues are known.</description>

      <title>The critical case for the concentration of eigenfunctions on singular Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary with a certain class of critical singular Riemannian metrics that are singular at the boundary. The corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator can be seen as a Grushin-type operator plus a potential. We show in the critical case that the average density of eigenfunctions for the Laplace-Beltrami operator with eigenvalues below $\lambda&gt;0$ is distributed over all length scales between $\lambda^{-1/2}$ and $1$ near the boundary. We give a precise description of this distribution as $\lambda\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>An Introductory Guide to Koopman Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman operators provide a linear framework for data-driven analyses of nonlinear dynamical systems, but their infinite-dimensional nature presents major computational challenges. In this article, we offer an introductory guide to Koopman learning, emphasizing rigorously convergent data-driven methods for forecasting and spectral analysis. We provide a unified account of error control via residuals in both finite- and infinite-dimensional settings, an elementary proof of convergence for generalized Laplace analysis -- a variant of filtered power iteration that works for operators with continuous spectra and no spectral gaps -- and review state-of-the-art approaches for computing continuous spectra and spectral measures. The goal is to provide both newcomers and experts with a clear, structured overview of reliable data-driven techniques for Koopman spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Davis-Kahan Theorem under a moderate gap condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Davis-Kahan theorem provides an efficient bound on the perturbation of eigenspaces of a matrix under a large (eigenvalue) gap condition. In this paper, we consider the case when the gap is moderate. Using a bootstrapping argument, we obtain a new bound which is efficient when the perturbation matrix is uncorrelated to the ground matrix. We believe that this bound is sharp up to a logarithmic term.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for radial conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of characterizing sequences of real numbers that arise as spectra of Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) maps for elliptic operators has attracted considerable attention over the past fifty years. In this article, we address this question in the simple setting of DtN maps associated with a rotation-invariant elliptic operator $\nabla \cdot (\gamma\nabla \centerdot )$ in the ball in Euclidean space. We show that the spectrum of such a DtN operator can be expressed as a universal term, determined solely by the boundary values of the conductivity $\gamma$, plus a sequence of Hausdorff moments of an integrable function, which we call the Born approximation of $\gamma$. We also show that this object is locally determined from the boundary by the corresponding values of the conductivity, a property that implies a local uniqueness result for the Calder\'on Problem in this setting. We also give a stability result: the functional mapping the Born approximation to its conductivity is H\"older stable in suitable Sobolev spaces. Finally, in order to refine the characterization of the Born approximation, we analyze its regularity properties and their dependence on the conductivity.</description>

      <title>Note on the Construction of Structure Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares (TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which, although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion, provided they are sufficiently concentrated.</description>

      <title>Grassmanian Interpolation of Low-Pass Graph Filters: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the filter interpolation.</description>

      <title>Non-compact inaudibility of Naturally Reductive property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Naturally reductive manifolds are an important class of Riemannian manifolds because they provide examples that generalize the locally symmetric ones. A property is said to be inaudible if there exists a unitary operator which intertwines the Laplace-Beltrami operator of two Riemannian manifolds such that one of them satisfies the property and the other does not.
  In this paper, we study the relation between 2-step nilpotent Lie groups and the naturally reductive property to prove that this property is inaudible, using a pair of non-compact 11-dimensional generalized Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov. Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>

      <title>On generalized inverses of matrices associated with certain graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate generalized inverses of matrices associated with two classes of digraphs: double star digraphs and D-linked stars digraphs. For double star digraphs, we determine the Drazin index and derive explicit formulas for the Drazin inverse. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the Moore-Penrose inverse and give its explicit expression whenever it exists. For D-linked stars digraphs, we characterize when the group inverse exists and obtain its explicit form. In the singular case where BC = 0, we express the Drazin index of the matrix in terms of the Drazin index of the base digraph matrix. Additionally, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for Moore--Penrose invertibility and derive explicit formulas in that case. Our results reveal a clear connection between the algebraic structure of generalized inverses and the combinatorial properties of these graph classes, providing a unified framework for group, Drazin, and Moore-Penrose invertibility.</description>

Abstract: We prove eigenvalue bounds for Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta_g+V$ on compact manifolds with complex potentials $V$. The bounds depend only on an $L^q$-norm of the potential, and they are shown to be optimal, in a certain sense, on the round sphere and more general Zoll manifolds. These bounds are natural analogues of Frank's \cite{MR2820160} results in the Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fundamental Gap Estimate on Convex Domains in Gaussian Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sharp lower bound for the fundamental gap on convex domains in Gaussian spaces, the difference between the first two eigenvalues of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main result establishes that the gap is bounded below by the gap of the corresponding one-dimensional model, confirming the Gaussian analogue of the fundamental gap conjecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalized gap of the one-dimensional model is monotonically increasing with the diameter and prove the sharpness of our estimate. Beyond the fundamental gap, we also establish improved log-concavity properties for the Dirichlet heat kernel on convex domains in Gaussian spaces. Our work on Gaussian spaces complements the existing results of Andrews and Clutterbuck and Ni for Euclidean domains, as well as the work of Seto, Wang, and Wei for spherical domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym bounds for eigenfunctions of Blair--Sogge to a larger range of exponents, which is optimal in odd dimensions. On manifolds of constant sectional curvature we introduce a new anisotropic variant of the microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym norm that further enlarges the admissible $p$-range. As a corollary, we obtain improved $L^p$ bounds for Hecke--Maass forms on compact hyperbolic $3$-manifolds by combining with a recent result of Hou. Further applications include sharp $L^q\!\to\!L^p$ estimates for H\"ormander operators in odd dimensions, improved $L^q\!\to\!L^p$ Fourier extension bounds, and improved bounds for the Bochner--Riesz conjecture in $\mathbb R^3$.</description>

      <title>From small eigenvalues to large cuts, and Chowla's cosine problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every graph with average degree $d$ and smallest adjacency eigenvalue $|\lambda_n|\leq d^{\gamma}$ contains a clique of size $d^{1-O(\gamma)}$. A simple corollary of this yields the first polynomial bound for Chowla's cosine problem (1965): for every finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$, the minimum of the cosine polynomial satisfies $$\min_{x\in [0, 2\pi]}\sum_{a\in A}\cos(ax)\leq -|A|^{1/10-o(1)}.$$
  Another application makes significant progress on the problem of MaxCut in $H$-free graphs initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz in the 1970's. We show that every $m$-edge graph with no clique of size $m^{1/2-\delta}$ has a cut of size at least $m/2+m^{1/2+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\delta)&gt;0$.</description>
