      <title>Deceptive Planning Exploiting Inattention Blindness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decision-making with rational inattention in settings where agents have perception constraints. In such settings, inaccurate prior beliefs or models of others may lead to inattention blindness, where an agent is unaware of its incorrect beliefs. We model this phenomenon in two-player zero-sum stochastic games, where Player 1 has perception constraints and Player 2 deceptively deviates from its security policy presumed by Player 1 to gain an advantage. We formulate the perception constraints as an online sensor selection problem, develop a value-weighted objective function for sensor selection capturing rational inattention, and propose the greedy algorithm for selection under this monotone objective function. When Player 2 does not deviate from the presumed policy, this objective function provides an upper bound on the expected value loss compared to the security value where Player 1 has perfect information of the state. We then propose a myopic decision-making algorithm for Player 2 to exploit Player 1's beliefs by deviating from the presumed policy and, thereby, improve upon the security value. Numerical examples illustrate how Player 1 persistently chooses sensors that are consistent with its priors, allowing Player 2 to systematically exploit its inattention.</description>

      <title>Reach together: How populations win repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In repeated games, players choose actions concurrently at each step. We consider a parameterized setting of repeated games in which the players form a population of an arbitrary size. Their utility functions encode a reachability objective. The problem is whether there exists a uniform coalition strategy for the players so that they are sure to win independently of the population size. We use algebraic tools to show that the problem can be solved in polynomial space. First we exhibit a finite semigroup whose elements summarize strategies over a finite interval of population sizes. Then, we characterize the existence of winning strategies by the existence of particular elements in this semigroup. Finally, we provide a matching complexity lower bound, to conclude that repeated population games with reachability objectives are PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work investigates the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs in the context of a two-player finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player, measured or estimated at each stage, affect the state and cost function of the other player. To mitigate these effects, we propose an adjusted control policy that optimally compensates for the deviations under the stated information structure and can, under certain conditions, exploit them to improve performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a representative numerical example.</description>

      <title>Explainable Information Design</title>

Abstract: The optimal signaling schemes in information design (Bayesian persuasion) problems often involve non-explainable randomization or disconnected partitions of state space, which are too intricate to be audited or communicated. We propose explainable information design in the context of information design with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use $K$-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE) -- the ratio between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and unrestricted signaling scheme -- is exactly $1/2$ in the worst case, meaning that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling schemes by a factor of 2.
  We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But for Lipschitz utility functions, an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find an explainable signaling scheme that provides a $1/2$ approximation to the optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.
  A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme (which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that achieves $1/2$ fraction of the expected utility of the former. We use this tool in the proofs of both our PoE result and algorithmic result.</description>
