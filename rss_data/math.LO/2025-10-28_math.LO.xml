      <title>Embedding stable groups into algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting a proof of Bouscaren and Delon, we show that every type-definable connected group in a given stable theory of fields embeds into an algebraic group, under a condition on the definable closure. We also present general hypotheses which yield a uniform description of the definable closure in such theories of fields.
  The setting includes in particular the theories of separably closed fields of arbitrary degree of imperfection and differentially closed fields of arbitrary characteristic.</description>

      <title>Operators on complemented posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complemented poset P, we can assign to every element x of P the set x^+ of all its complements. We study properties of the operator ^+ on P, in particular, we are interested in the case when x^+ forms an antichain or when ^+ is involutive or antitone. We apply ^+ to the set Min U(x,y) of all minimal elements of the upper cone U(x,y) of x,y and to the set Max L(x,y) of all maximal elements of the lower cone L(x,y) of x,y. By using ^+ we define four binary operators on P and investigate their properties that are close to adjointness. We present an example of a uniquely complemented poset that is not Boolean. In the last section we study the orthogonality relation induced by complementation. We characterize when two elements of the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of P are orthogonal to each other. Finally, we extend the orthogonality relation from elements to subsets and we prove that two non-empty subsets of P are orthogonal to each other if and only if their convex hulls are orthogonal to each other within the poset of all non-empty convex subsets of P.</description>

      <title>Adding cofinal countable sequences through multiple regular cardinals by ssp forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a direct construction of stationary set preserving forcings that make $\omega$-cofinal all the members of some arbitrary set $\mathcal{K}$ of regular cardinals $\kappa &gt; \omega_1$. In addition, it is made possible to ensure that no other uncountable regular cardinals from the ground model acquire countable cofinality in the forcing extension. Our method is elementary, being based on a combinatorial argument by Foreman and Magidor together with generalizations of typical side-condition arguments and needs no assumptions beyond $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>Coherent Conditions: Algebraic Geometry for Arbitrary Classes of Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal algebraic geometry is generalised from solutions of equations in a single algebra to the study of $\varphi$- or $K$-spectra, akin to the prime spectrum of a ring. We explore their basic properties and constructions, give a correspondence between certain quantifier-free propositions and closed sets in the Zariski topology of a free algebra, and show the connection with current UAG. Lastly, equationally Noetherian classes and irreducible spectra are explored.</description>

      <title>Finite model property of pretransitive analogues of (w)K4 and GL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A normal modal logic is pretransitive, if the modality corresponding to the transitive closure of an accessibility relation is expressible in it. In the present work we establish the finite model property for pretransitive generalizations of K4, wK4, GL, and their extensions by canonical subframe-hereditary formulas.</description>

      <title>The adjacent Hindman's theorem and the $\mathbb Z$-Ramsey's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the restriction of Ramsey's theorem that arises from considering only translation-invariant colourings of pairs, and show that this has the same strength (both from the viewpoint of Reverse Mathematics and from the viewpoint of Computability Theory) as the {\em Adjacent Hindman's Theorem}, proposed by L. Carlucci (Arch. Math. Log. {\bf 57} (2018), 381--359). We also investigate some higher dimensional versions of both of these statements.</description>

      <title>Categories of orthosets and adjointable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orthoset is a non-empty set together with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation $\perp$, called the orthogonality relation. An orthoset with 0 is an orthoset augmented with an additional element 0, called falsity, which is orthogonal to every element. The collection of subspaces of a Hilbert space that are spanned by a single vector provides a motivating example.
  We say that a map $f \colon X \to Y$ between orthosets with 0 possesses the adjoint $g \colon Y \to X$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, $f(x) \perp y$ if and only if $x \perp g(y)$. We call $f$ in this case adjointable. For instance, any bounded linear map between Hilbert spaces induces a map with this property. We discuss in this paper adjointability from several perspectives and we put a particular focus on maps preserving the orthogonality relation.
  We moreover investigate the category OS of all orthosets with 0 and adjointable maps between them. We especially focus on the full subcategory iOS of irredundant orthosets with 0. iOS can be made into a dagger category, the dagger of a morphism being its unique adjoint. iOS contains dagger subcategories of various sorts and provides in particular a framework for the investigation of projective Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>A Fibonacci-Based G\"odel Numbering: $\Delta_0$ Semantics Without Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an additive G\"odel framework in which self-reference and incompleteness arise through bounded recursion rather than unbounded multiplication. Using Zeckendorf representations and a bit-lane encoding of finite sequences, we construct a primitive-recursive G\"odel numbering that is fully $\Delta_0$-definable within weak arithmetic. This enables diagonalization, substitution, and provability to be formalized without exponentiation or factorization.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of limit models in a first order setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally introduced by Kolmann and Shelah as a surrogate for saturated models, limit models have been established as natural and useful objects when studying abstract elementary classes. Shelah began the study of when (multiple notions of) limit models exist for first order theories. In this paper we look at their structure.
  In superstable theories it is known that all limit models are isomorphic, but in the strictly stable case the number of non-isomorphic limit models was not well understood. Here we characterise the full spectrum of limit models in the first order stable setting, by a short and simple argument using only the familiar machinery of stable first order theories:
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Let $T$ be a complete $\lambda$-stable theory where $\lambda \geq |\operatorname{L}(T)| + \aleph_0$. Let $\delta_1, \delta_2 &lt; \lambda^+$ be limit ordinals where $\operatorname{cf}(\delta_1)&lt; \operatorname{cf}(\delta_2)$. Let $N_l$ be a $(\lambda, \delta_l)$-limit model for $l = 1, 2$. Then $N_1$ and $N_2$ are isomorphic if and only if $\operatorname{cf}(\delta_1) \geq \kappa_r(T)$.
  Moreover, if $\kappa_r(T) = \aleph_\alpha$, there are exactly $|\alpha| + 1$ limit models up to isomorphism.
  In the context of first order stable theories, this reduces the proof of the main result of arXiv:2503.11605 from 19 pages to 2. We hope this will make limit models a more comprehensible and accessible tool in first order model theory.</description>

      <title>A discrete-time temporal deontic STIT logic based on interpreted systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a STIT ('see to it that') logic with discrete temporal operators and deontic operators in which we can formalize and reason about legal concepts such as persistent duty and the dynamic concept of power from Hohfeld. As our main technical contribution, we show that this logic is sound and complete with respect to the semantics based on interpreted systems and is decidable.</description>
