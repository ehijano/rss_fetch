      <title>Instability and warping in vertically oscillating accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many accretion discs have been found to be distorted: either warped due a misalignment in the system, or non-circular as a result of orbital eccentricity or tidal deformation by a binary companion. Warped, eccentric, and tidally distorted discs are not in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus exhibit vertical oscillations in the direction perpendicular to the disc, a phenomenon that is absent in circular and flat discs. In extreme cases, this vertical motion is manifested as a vertical `bouncing' of the gas, potentially leading to shocks and heating, as observed in recent global numerical simulations. In this paper we isolate the mechanics of vertical disc oscillations by means of quasi-2D and fully 3D hydrodynamic local (shearing-box) models. To determine the numerical and physical dissipation mechanisms at work during an oscillation we start by investigating unforced oscillations, examining the effect of initial oscillation amplitude, as well as resolution, boundary conditions, and vertical box size on the dissipation and energetics of the oscillations. We then drive the oscillations by introducing a time-dependent gravitational potential. A key result is that even a purely vertically oscillating disc is (parametrically) unstable to developing inertial waves, as we confirm through a linear stability analysis. The most important of these has the character of a bending wave, whose radial wavelength depends on the frequency of the vertical oscillation. The nonlinear phase of the instability exhibits shocks, which dampen the oscillations, although energy can also flow from the bending wave back to the vertical oscillation.</description>

      <title>A Pileup of Coronal Mass Ejections Produced the Largest Geomagnetic Storm in Two Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest geomagnetic storm in two decades occurred in 2024 May with a minimum $D_{\rm st}$ of $-412$ nT. We examine its solar and interplanetary origins by combining multipoint imaging and in situ observations. The source active region, NOAA AR 13664, exhibited extraordinary activity and produced successive halo eruptions, which were responsible for two complex ejecta observed at the Earth. In situ measurements from STEREO A, which was $12.6^{\circ}$ apart, allow us to compare the ``geo-effectiveness" at the Earth and STEREO A. We obtain key findings concerning the formation of solar superstorms and how mesoscale variations of coronal mass ejections affect geo-effectiveness: (1) the 2024 May storm supports the hypothesis that solar superstorms are ``perfect storms" in nature, i.e., a combination of circumstances resulting in an event of an unusual magnitude; (2) the first complex ejecta, which caused the geomagnetic superstorm, shows considerable differences in the magnetic field and associated ``geo-effectiveness" between the Earth and STEREO A, despite a mesoscale separation; and (3) two contrasting cases of complex ejecta are found in terms of the geo-effectiveness at the Earth, which is largely due to different magnetic field configurations within the same active region.</description>

      <title>MHD waves in the partially ionized plasma: from single to multi-fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Chapter outlines the basic properties of waves in solar partially ionized plasmas. It provides a summary of the main sets of equations, from the single-fluid formalism, to the multi-fluid one, giving examples for purely hydrogen, and for hydrogen-helium plasmas. It then discusses the solutions for waves under the single-fluid frame: the influence of the ambipolar diffusion, diamagnetic effect, and the Hall effect on the propagation, dissipation, and mode conversion of the magnetohydrodynamic waves. The Chapter continues by outlining the wave solutions in the multi-fluid formalism: the influence of the elastic inter-particle collisions into the propagation, damping and dissipation of different magnetohydrodynamic modes. Both parts discuss linear and non-linear wave solutions, and the effects of the gravitational stratification of the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>A search for mode coupling in magnetic bright points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Magnetic bright points (MBPs) are one of the smallest manifestations of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere and are observed to extend from the photosphere up to the chromosphere. As such, they represent an excellent feature to use in searches for types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and mode coupling in the solar atmosphere. Aims. In this work, we aim to study wave propagation in the lower solar atmosphere by comparing intensity oscillations in the photosphere with the chromosphere via a search for possible mode coupling, in order to establish the importance of these types of waves in the solar atmosphere, and their contribution to heating the chromosphere. Methods. Observations were conducted in July 2011 with the ROSA and the HARDCam instruments at the Dunn Solar Telescope. We used wavelet analysis to identify traveling MHD waves and derive frequencies in the G-band and H$\alpha$wave bands. We isolated a large sample of MBPs using an automated tracking algorithm throughout our observations. Two dozen of the brightest MBPs were selected from the sample for further study. Results. We find oscillations in the G-band MBPs, with frequencies between 1.5 and 3.6 mHz. Corresponding MBPs in the lower solar chromosphere observed in H$\alpha$ show a frequency range of 1.4 to 4.3 mHz. In about 38\% of the MBPs, the ratio of H$\alpha$ to G-band frequencies was near two. Thus, these oscillations show a form of mode coupling where the transverse waves in the photosphere are converted into longitudinal waves in the chromosphere. Conclusions. From simple estimates we find an energy flux of $\approx$45 $\times 10^{3}$ W m$^{-2}$ and show that the energy flowing through MBPs is enough to heat the chromosphere, and mode coupling is important in helping us understand the types of MHD waves in the lower solar atmosphere and the overall energy budget.</description>

      <title>Photo-nuclear reaction rates of $^{157,159}$Ho and $^{163,165}$Tm and their impact in the $\gamma$--process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable photo-nuclear reaction rates at the stellar conditions are essential to understand the origin of the heavy stable neutron-deficient isotopes between $^{74}$Se and $^{196}$Hg-p-nuclei, however, many reaction rates of relevance still have to rely on the Hauser-Feshbach model due to rare experimental progress. One such case is in the mass range of 160 for Dy, Er, Ho and Tm isotopes. In this work we attempt to constrain the Hauser-Feshbach model in the TALYS package by reproducing the available experimental data of $^{160}$Dy($p,\gamma$)$^{161}$Ho and $^{162}$Er($p,\gamma$)$^{163}$Tm in the $A\sim 160$ mass region, and examine the effects of level density, gamma strength function and the optical model potential. The constrained model then allows us to calculate the reaction rates of $^{157, 159}$Ho($\gamma$, $p$) and $^{163,165}$Tm($\gamma$, $p$) for the $\gamma$-process nucleosynthesis in carbon-deflagration SNe Ia model. Our recommended rates differ from the JINA REACLIB by more than 1 order of magnitude in the temperature range of 2-3 GK. This results in the changes of final abundance of $p$-nuclei in the $A\sim 160$ mass range by -5.5-3\% from those with JINA, which means that the ($\gamma$, $p$) reactions uncertainty is not predominant for the synthesis of these nuclei.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the spectroscopic masses of 249 evolved stars using asteroseismology with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to understand planet formation is through studying the correlations between planet occurrence rates and stellar mass. However, measuring stellar mass in the red giant regime is very difficult. In particular, the spectroscopic masses of certain evolved stars, often referred to as "retired A-stars", have been questioned in the literature. Efforts to resolve this mass controversy using spectroscopy, interferometry and asteroseismology have so far been inconclusive. A recent ensemble study found a mass-dependent mass offset, but the result was based on only 16 stars. With NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we expand the investigation of the mass discrepancy to a total of 92 low-luminosity stars, synonymous with the retired A-stars. We measure their characteristic oscillation frequency, $\mathrm{\nu}_{\mathrm{max}}$, and the large frequency separation, $\mathrm{\Delta\nu}$, from their TESS photometric time series. Using these measurements and asteroseismic scaling relations, we derive asteroseismic masses and compare them with spectroscopic masses from five surveys, to comprehensively study the alleged mass-dependent mass offset. We find a mass offset between spectroscopy and seismology that increases with stellar mass. However, we note that adopting the seismic mass scale does not have a significant effect on the planet occurrence-mass-metallicity correlation for the so-called retired A-stars. We also report seismic measurements and masses for 157 higher luminosity giants (mostly helium-core-burning) from the spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>IBEX Observations of Elastic Scattering of Interstellar Helium by Solar Wind Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IBEX-Lo instrument on the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission observes primary and secondary interstellar helium in its 4 lowest energy steps. Observations of these helium populations have been systematically analyzed and compared to simulations using the analytic full integration of neutrals model (aFINM). A systematic difference is observed between the simulations and observations of secondary helium during solar cycle (SC) 24. We show that elastic scattering of primary helium by solar wind protons, which redistributes atoms from the core of the flux distribution, provides an explanation of the observed divergence from simulations. We verify that elastic scattering forms a halo in the wings of the primary He distribution in the spin-angle direction. Correcting the simulation for the effects of elastic scattering requires an increase of the estimated density of primary helium compared to previous estimates by Ulysses/GAS. Thus, based on our analysis of IBEX observations and $\chi ^2$ minimization of simulation data that include the effects of elastic scattering, any estimation of neutral interstellar helium density at 1 AU by direct detection of the peak flux of neutral helium needs to be adjusted by $~\sim$ 10%</description>

      <title>Characterization of blue and yellow straggler stars of Berkeley 39 using Swift/UVOT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize blue straggler stars (BSS) and yellow straggler stars (YSS) of an open cluster (OC) Berkeley 39 using multi-wavelength observations including Swift/UVOT. Our analysis also makes use of ultraviolet (UV) data from GALEX, optical data from Gaia DR3 and Pan-STARRS, and infrared data from 2MASS, Spitzer/IRAC, and WISE. Berkeley 39 is a ~6 Gyr old Galactic OC located at a distance of ~4200 pc. We identify 729 sources as cluster members utilizing a machine learning algorithm, ML-MOC, on Gaia DR3 data. Of these, 17 sources are classified as BSS candidates and four as YSS candidates. We construct multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 16 BSS and 2 YSS candidates, within the Swift/UVOT field, to analyze their properties. Out of these, 8 BSS candidates and both the YSS candidates are successfully fitted with single-component SEDs. Five BSS candidates show marginal excess in the near-UV (fractional residual &lt; 0.3 in all but one UVOT filter), whereas three BSS candidates show moderate to significant excess in the near-UV (fractional residual &gt; 0.3 in at least two UVOT filters). We present the properties of the BSS and YSS candidates, estimated based on the SED fits.</description>

      <title>Undersampling effects on observed periods of coronal oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Recent observations of decayless transverse oscillations have shown two branches in the relationship between periods and loop lengths. One is a linear relationship, interpreted as a standing mode. The other shows almost no correlation and has not yet been interpreted conclusively. Aims. We investigated the undersampling effect on observed periods of decayless oscillations. Methods. We considered oscillating coronal loops that closely follow the observed loop length distribution. Assuming that all oscillations are standing waves, we modeled a signal that represents decayless oscillations where the period is proportional to the loop length and the amplitude and phase are randomly drawn. A downsampled signal was generated from the original signal by considering different sample rates that mimic temporal cadences of telescopes, and periods for sampled signals were analysed using the fast Fourier transform. Results. When the sampling cadence is getting closer to the actual oscillation period, a tendency for overestimating periods in short loops is enhanced. The relationship between loop lengths and periods of the sampled signals shows the two branches as in the observation. Conclusions. We find that long periods of decayless oscillations occurring in short loops could be the result of undersampling.</description>

      <title>Self-similar solutions of oscillatory reconnection: parameter study of magnetic field strength and background temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory reconnection is a specific type of time-dependent reconnection which involves periodic changes in the magnetic topology of a null point. The mechanism has been reported for a variety of magnetic field strengths and configurations, background temperatures and densities. All these studies report an oscillation in the current density at the null point, but also report a variety of periods, amplitudes and overall behaviors. We conduct a parametric study for equilibrium magnetic field strength and initial background temperature, solving 2D resistive MHD equations around a magnetic X-point. We introduce a parameter space for the ratio of internal-to-magnetic energy and find self-similar solutions for simulations where this ratio is below 0.1 (which represents a magnetically-dominated environment or, equivalently, a low-beta plasma). Self-similarity can be seen in oscillations in the current density at the null (including amplitude and period), Ohmic heating and the temperature generated via reconnection jets. The parameter space of energy ratios also allows us to contextualize previous studies of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism and bring those different studies together into a single unified understanding.</description>

      <title>Linking Transients to their Host Galaxies: II. A Comparison of Host Galaxy Properties and Rate Dependencies across Supernova Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the latest dataset of supernova (SN) host galaxies to investigate how the host properties -- stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, absolute magnitude, and colour -- differ across SN types, with redshift-driven selection effects controlled. SN Ib and Ic host galaxies, on average, are more massive, metal-rich, and redder than SN II hosts. For subtypes, SN Ibn and Ic-BL have bluer hosts than their normal SN Ib and Ic siblings; SN IIb has consistent host properties with SN Ib, while hosts of SN IIn are more metal-rich than those of SN II. Hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernovae feature bluer and lower luminosity hosts than most subtypes of core-collapse supernova (CC SN). Assuming simple proportionality of CC SN rates and host star formation rates (SFRs) does not recover the observed mean host properties; either a population of long-lived progenitors or a metallicity-dependent SN production efficiency better reproduces the observed host properties. Assuming the latter case, the rates of SN II are insensitive to host metallicity, but the rates of SN Ib and Ic are substantially enhanced in metal-rich hosts by a factor of ~10 per dex increase in metallicity. Hosts of SN Ia are diverse in their observed properties; subtypes including SN Ia-91T, Ia-02cx, and Ia-CSM prefer star-forming hosts, while subtypes like SN Ia-91bg and Ca-rich prefer quiescent hosts. The rates of SN Ia-91T, Ia-02cx, and Ia-CSM are closely dependent on, or even proportional to, their host SFRs, indicating relatively short-lived progenitors. Conversely, the rates of SN Ia-91bg and Ca-rich transients are proportional to the total stellar mass, favoring long-lived progenitors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated and ongoing all-sky imaging survey in the narrowband H$\alpha$ wavelength. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers, and is presented here in its first stage of refinement for rigorous scientific use. Each field is exposed through an H$\alpha$ filter with a 3nm bandwidth for a total of four hours, with a pixel scale of 3.2 arcsec. Here, we introduce the first Data Release of the MDW H$\alpha$ Survey (Data Release 0, or DR0), spanning 238 fields in the region of Orion (~3100 deg$^2$). DR0 includes: calibrated mean fields, star-removed mean fields, a point source catalog matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), and mosaics.</description>

Abstract: Aims. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A (~1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation &gt;1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. Methods. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 Mearth. Combining these data (resolution ~1.1arcsec ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution ~0.7arcsec ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation (&gt;1000 AU). Results. We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10^4 AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23+0.6-0.4 Mearth for primary disks and 3.88+0.3-0.3 Mearth for secondary disks.</description>

      <title>orbitize! v3: Orbit fitting for the High-contrast Imaging Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: orbitize! is a package for Bayesian modeling of the orbital parameters of resolved binary objects from time series measurements. It was developed with the needs of the high-contrast imaging community in mind, and has since also become widely used in the binary star community. A generic orbitize! use case involves translating relative astrometric time series, optionally combined with radial velocity or astrometric time series, into a set of derived orbital posteriors. This paper is published alongside the release of orbitize! version 3.0, which has seen significant enhancements in functionality and accessibility since the release of version 1.0 (Blunt et al., 2020).</description>

      <title>Gravity or turbulence? VII. The Schmidt-Kennicutt law, the star formation efficiency, and the mass density of clusters from gravitational collapse rather than turbulent support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time ($\eff$), mirroring observational studies, in numerical simulations of filamentary molecular clouds undergoing gravitational contraction. We find that {\it a)} collapsing clouds accurately replicate the observed SK relations for galactic clouds and {\it b)} the so-called efficiency per free-fall time ($\eff$) is small and constant in space and in time, with values similar to those found in local clouds. This constancy is a consequence of the similar radial scaling of the free-fall time and the internal mass in density structures with spherically-averaged density profiles near $r^{-2}$. We additionally show that {\it c)} the star formation rate (SFR) increases rapidly in time; {\it d)} the low values of $\eff$ are due to the different time periods over which $\tauff$ and $\tausf$ are evaluated, together with the fast increasing SFR, and {\it e)} the fact that star clusters are significantly denser than the gas clumps from which they form is a natural consequence of the fast increasing SFR, the continuous replenishment of the star-forming gas by the accretion flow, and the near $r^{-2}$ density profile generated by the collapse Finally, we argue that the interpretation of $\eff$ as an efficiency is problematic because its maximum value is not bounded by unity, and because the total gas mass in the clouds is not fixed, but rather depends on the environment where clouds are embedded. In summary, our results show that the SK relation, the typical observed values of $\eff$, and the mass density of clusters arise as a natural consequence of gravitational contraction.</description>

      <title>Denoising medium resolution stellar spectra with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We trained denoiser autoencoding neural networks on medium resolution simulated optical spectra of late-type stars to demonstrate that the reconstruction of the original flux is possible at a typical relative error of a fraction of a percent down to a typical signal-to-noise ratio of 10 per pixel. We show that relatively simple networks are capable of learning the characteristics of stellar spectra while still flexible enough to adapt to different values of extinction and fluxing imperfections that modifies the overall shape of the continuum, as well as to different values of Doppler shift. Denoised spectra can be used to find initial values for traditional stellar template fitting algorithms and - since evaluation of pre-trained neural networks is significantly faster than traditional template fitting - denoiser networks can be useful when a fast analysis of the noisy spectrum is necessary, for example during observations, between individual exposures.</description>

      <title>SWEET-Cat: A view on the planetary mass-radius relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SWEET-Cat (Stars With ExoplanETs Catalogue) was originally introduced in 2013, and since then, the number of confirmed exoplanets has increased significantly. A crucial step for a comprehensive understanding of these new worlds is the precise and homogeneous characterization of their host stars. We used a large number of high-resolution spectra to continue the addition of new stellar parameters for planet-host stars in SWEET-Cat following the new detection of exoplanets listed both at the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia and at the NASA exoplanet archive. We obtained high-resolution spectra for a significant number of these planet-host stars, either observed by our team or collected through public archives. For FGK stars, the spectroscopic stellar parameters were derived for the spectra following the same homogeneous process using ARES+MOOG as for the previous SWEET-Cat releases. The stellar properties are combined with the planet properties to study possible correlations that could shed more light into the star-planet connection studies. We increase the number of stars with homogeneous parameters by 232 ($\sim$ 25\% - from 959 to 1191). We then focus on the exoplanets with both mass and radius determined to review the mass-radius relation where we find consistent results with the ones previously reported in the literature. For the massive planets we also revisit the radius anomaly where we confirm a metallicity correlation for the radius anomaly already hinted in previous results.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength spectroscopic analysis of the ULX Holmberg II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are high-mass X-ray binaries with an X-ray luminosity above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. These ULXs can be powered by black holes that are more massive than $20M_\odot$, accreting in a standard regime, or lighter compact objects accreting supercritically. There are only a few ULXs with known optical or UV counterparts, and their nature is debated. Determining whether optical/UV radiation is produced by the donor star or by the accretion disc is crucial for understanding ULX physics and testing massive binary evolution. We conduct, for the first time, a fully consistent multi-wavelength spectral analysis of a ULX and its circumstellar nebula. We aim to establish the donor star type and test the presence of strong disc winds in the prototypical ULX Holmberg II X-1 (Ho II X-1). We intent to obtain a realistic spectral energy distribution of the ionising source, which is needed for robust nebula analysis. We acquired new UV spectra of Ho II X-1 with the HST and complemented them with archival optical and X-ray data. We explored the spectral energy distribution of the source and analysed the spectra using the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and the photoionisation code Cloudy. Our analysis of the X-ray, UV, and optical spectra of Ho II X-1 and its nebula consistently explains the observations. We do not find traces of disc wind signatures in the UV and the optical, rejecting previous claims of the ULX being a supercritical accretor. The optical/UV counterpart of HoII X-1 is explained by a B-type supergiant donor star. Thus, the observations are fully compatible with Ho II X-1 being a close binary consisting of an $\gtrsim 66\,M_\odot$ black hole accreting matter from an $\simeq 22 M_\odot$ B-supergiant companion. Also, we propose a possible evolution scenario for the system, suggesting that Ho II X-1 is a potential gravitational wave source progenitor.</description>

Abstract: Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf 2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2 pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800 AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum. Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1 km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1 Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of 6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of 1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.</description>

      <title>Effect of time-varying X-ray emission from stellar flares on the ionization of protoplanetary disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of $\gtrsim10$ keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of simplifications in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of $ 10^{35}$ erg, X-ray photons with $\gtrsim 5$ keV increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays down to $z \approx 0.1R$. The contribution of flare X-rays to the ionization at the midplane depends on the disk parameters such as disk mass and dust settling. We also find that the 10-year-averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Supersonic Solar Wind: Parker's Theory Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine and propose to fundamentally modify the classical theory of solar wind formation. To form a supersonic solar wind, the classical theory requires that a subsonic flow speed must start at a specific initial speed from the coronal base, called eigenspeed, go along a continuous eigenfunction, and reach the sonic point, which is where the flow speed equals the sonic speed, while the critical condition, which is where the effective driving force is zero, is satisfied. Any mismatch between the sonic point and critical condition distances results in either subsonic winds when the initial speed is below the eigenspeed, or no solar wind when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. Because the critical condition is determined by the solar wind temperature profile, which depends on ionization process at the top of the chromosphere and the heating process around the coronal base but not by the processes at the sonic point, the required match between the two is generally not met and hence the momentum equation in the conventional theory encounters difficulty when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. To resolve the difficulty, we propose a discontinuity between the sonic point and the critical condition to reach supersonic solar wind solutions. As a result, supersonic solar winds can be produced when the initial speed in the coronal base is greater than the eigenspeed. The critical solution or eigen function provided by the conventional solar wind model describes the condition that separates the supersonic solar winds from subsonic ones.</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using machine-learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions, given spectro-photometric data. To this end, we build a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra) without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we are able to interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we use high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE, and GES), complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have parallaxes. We achieve median uncertainties (at $G\approx16$) of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeed in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone fitting methods we employed in earlier work, especially for the parameters $A_V$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity. Finally, we showcase some applications of this new catalogue (e.g. extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

      <title>Evolution of stars with 60 and 200 Msun: predictions for WNh stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the evolution of two massive stars at solar metallicity (Z=0.014) taken from Romagnolo et al. (2024, Paper I); by running evolution models for initial masses 60 and 200 Msun, using MESA and GENEC. For the mass loss, we adopt the self-consistent m-CAK prescription for the optically thin winds of OB-stars, a semi-empirical formula for H-rich thick wind of WNh stars, and a hydrodynamically consistent formula for the H-poor thick wind of classical Wolf-Rayet stars. We set initial rotation as 40% of the critical angular velocity, overshooting =0.5, Tayler-Spruit for the angular momentum transport, and Ledoux criterion for the convective layers. Both codes predict different tracks across the HRD. For the 60 Msun case, Genec models predict a more efficient rotational mixing and more chemically homogeneous evolution, whereas MESA model predicts a large radial expansion post-MS reaching the LBV phase. For the 200 Msun case, differences are less relevant because their evolution is dominated by wind mass loss with a weaker dependence on internal mixing, and only the treatment for superadiabacity creates an impact during the He-burning stage. The switch of the mass loss based on the proximity to the Eddington factor instead of the removal of outer layers, implies the existence of WNh stars with a large mass fraction of hydrogen at the surface formed from initial masses $\gtrsim60$ Msun. These stars are constrained in a Teff range of the HR diagram which corresponds to the MS band, in agreement with the observations of Galactic WNh stars. While our models employ a fixed $\Gamma_e$ threshold for the switch to thick winds, rather than a continuous thin-to-thick wind model, the good reproduction of observations supports the robustness of the wind model upgrades introduced in Paper I, allowing its application to studies of late-stage stellar evolution before core collapse.</description>

      <title>Automated detection of exploding granules with SDO/HMI data</title>

Abstract: Exploding granules on the solar surface play a major role in the dynamics of the outer part of the convection zone, especially in the diffusion of the magnetic field. We aim to develop an automated procedure able to investigate the location and evolution of exploding granules over the solar surface and to get rid of visual detection. We used sequences of observations of intensity and Doppler velocity, as well as magnetograms, provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The automated detection of the exploding granules was performed by applying criteria on either three or two parameters: the granule area, the amplitude of the velocity field divergence, and, at the disc centre, the radial Doppler velocity. Our analyses show that granule area and divergence amplitudes are sufficient to detect the largest exploding granules; thus, we can automatically detect them, not only at the disc centre, but across the whole solar surface. Using a 24-hour-long observation sequence, we have demonstrated the important contribution of the most dynamic exploding granules in the diffusion of the magnetic field in the quiet Sun. Indeed, we have shown that the most intense exploding granules are sufficient to build a large part of the photospheric network. We have also applied our procedure on Hinode observations to locate the exploding granules relative to trees of fragmenting granules (TFGs). We conclude that, during a first phase of about 300 minutes after the birth of a TFG, exploding granules are preferentially located on its edge. Finally, we also show that the distribution of exploding granules is homogeneous (at the level of our measurement errors) over the solar surface without a significant dependency on latitude.</description>

      <title>The coevolution of migrating planets and their pulsating stars through episodic resonance locking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are expected to form far from their host star and move toward close-in, circular orbits via a smooth, monotonic decay due to mild and constant tidal dissipation. Yet, three systems have recently been found exhibiting planet-induced stellar pulsations suggesting unexpectedly strong tidal interactions. Here we combine stellar evolution and tide models to show that dynamical tides raised by eccentric gas giants can give rise to chains of resonance locks with multiple modes, enriching the dynamics seen in single-mode resonance locking of circularized systems. These series of resonance locks yield orders-of-magnitude larger changes in eccentricity and harmonic pulsations relative to those expected from a single episode of resonance locking or nonresonant tidal interactions. Resonances become more frequent as a star evolves off the main sequence providing an alternative explanation to the origin of some stellar pulsators and yielding the concept of "dormant migrating giants". Evolution trajectories are characterized by competing episodes of inward/outward migration and spin-up/-down of the star which are sensitive to the system parameters, revealing a new challenge in modeling migration paths and in contextualizing the observed populations of giant exoplanets and stellar binaries. This sensitivity however offers a new window to constrain the stellar properties of planetary hosts via tidal asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various nonaxisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 20 and a rate similar to Type Ib/c supernovae, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>

      <title>Blue supergiants as a progenitor of intermediate-luminosity red transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current perspective about the explosions of massive hydrogen-rich blue supergiants is that they resemble SN 1987A. These so-called peculiar Type II supernovae, however, are one of the rarest types of supernovae and may not hence be the fate of all blue supergiants. In this work, we explore other explosion scenarios for blue supergiants. We create synthetic light curves from the explosions of blue supergiant models born from binary mergers, over a range of explosion energies and 56Ni masses. We find that blue supergiant explosions may also lead to intermediate-luminosity red transients. We thus identify two categories of supernovae possible from blue supergiant explosions: those with high 56Ni masses (&gt; ~ 0.01 Msun) result in slow-rising, dome-shaped light curves like SN 1987A. Lower 56Ni masses result in low-luminosity, short-plateau light curves resembling some intermediate-luminosity red transients and Type II supernovae like SN 2008bp, which are possible from the explosions of compact blue supergiants and not from the far more extended red supergiants. Our results indicate that blue supergiant explosions are more diverse than SN 1987A-like events and may be hidden among different kinds of transients, explaining the possible discrepancies between the expected fraction of blue supergiants born from binary mergers and the observed fraction of SN 1987A-like supernovae.</description>

      <title>Viewing explosion models of type Ia supernovae via the insight from terrestrial cellular detonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cellular structure is considered to be a key as a criterion in initiation, propagation, and quenching of terrestrial detonation. While a few studies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have addressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment will benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present study, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing on the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering process for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are quantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that widely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation of detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing to apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical problems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>
