      <title>An introduction to tensors for path signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fit-for-purpose introduction to tensors and their operations. It is envisaged to help the reader become acquainted with its underpinning concepts for the study of path signatures. The text includes exercises, solutions and many intuitive explanations. The material discusses direct sums and tensor products as two possible operations that make the Cartesian product of vectors spaces a vector space. The difference lies in linear Vs multilinear structures -- the latter being the suitable one to deal with path signatures. The presentation is offered to understand tensors in a deeper sense than just a multidimensional array. The text concludes with the prime example of an algebra in relation to path signatures: the 'tensor algebra'.
  This manuscript is the extended version (with two extra sections) of a chapter to appear in Open Access in a forthcoming Springer volume 'Signatures Methods in Finance: An Introduction with Computational Applications'. The two additional sections here discuss the factoring of tensor product expressions to a minimal number of terms. This problem is not critical for path signatures theory, but is an elegant way of becoming familiar with the language of tensors and tensor products that are used throughout the forthcoming volume. A GitHub repository is attached.</description>
