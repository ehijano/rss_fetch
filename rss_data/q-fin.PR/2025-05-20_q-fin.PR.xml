      <title>The Stablecoin Discount: Evidence of Tether's U.S. Treasury Bill Market Share in Lowering Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins represent a critical bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional finance, with Tether (USDT) dominating the sector as the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. By Q1 2025, Tether directly held approximately $98.5 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, representing 1.6% of all outstanding Treasury bills, making it one of the largest non-sovereign buyers in this crucial asset class, on par with nation-state-level investors. This paper investigates how Tether's market share of U.S. Treasury bills influences corresponding yields. The baseline semi-log time trend model finds that a 1% increase in Tether's market share is associated with a 1-month yield reduction of 3.8%, corresponding to 14-16 basis points. However, threshold regression analysis reveals a critical market share threshold of 0.973%, above which the yield impact intensifies significantly. In this high regime, a 1% market share increase reduces 1-month yields by 6.3%. At the end of Q1 2025, Tether's market share placed it firmly within this high-impact regime, reducing 1-month yields by around 24 basis points relative to a counterfactual. In absolute terms, Tether's demand for Treasury Bills equates to roughly $15 billion in annual interest savings for the U.S. government. Aligning with theories of liquidity saturation and nonlinear price impact, these results highlight that stablecoin demand can reduce sovereign funding costs and provide a potential buffer against market shocks.</description>

      <title>Filtering in a hazard rate change-point model with financial and life-insurance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous-time filtering framework for estimating a hazard rate subject to an unobservable change-point. This framework arises naturally in both financial and insurance applications, where the default intensity of a firm or the mortality rate of an individual may experience a sudden jump at an unobservable time, representing, for instance, a shift in the firm's risk profile or a deterioration in an individual's health status. By employing a progressive enlargement of filtration, we integrate noisy observations of the hazard rate with default-related information. We characterise the filter, i.e. the conditional probability of the change-point given the information flow, as the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by the innovation process enriched with the discontinuous component. A sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the filter's behaviour under various information structures are provided. Our framework further allows for the derivation of an explicit formula for the survival probability conditional on partial information. This result applies to the pricing of credit-sensitive financial instruments such as defaultable bonds, credit default swaps, and life insurance contracts. Finally, a numerical analysis illustrates how partial information leads to delayed adjustments in the estimation of the hazard rate and consequently to mispricing of credit-sensitive instruments when compared to a full-information setting.</description>

      <title>Portfolios Generated by Contingent Claim Functions, with Applications to Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis of the theories of portfolio generating functions and option pricing. The theory of portfolio generation is extended to measure the value of portfolios generated by positive C^{2,1} functions of asset prices X_1,... , X_n directly, rather than with respect to a numeraire portfolio. If a portfolio generating function satisfies a specific partial differential equation, then the value of the portfolio generated by that function will replicate the value of the function. This differential equation is a general form of the Black-Scholes equation. Similar results apply to contingent claim functions, which are portfolio generating functions that are homogeneous of degree 1. With the addition of a riskless asset, an inhomogeneous portfolio generating function V : R^{+n} x [0, T] \to R^+ can be extended to an equivalent contingent claim function \hat{V} : R^+ x R^{+n} x [0, T] \to R^+ that generates the same portfolio and is replicable if and only if V is replicable. Several examples are presented.</description>
