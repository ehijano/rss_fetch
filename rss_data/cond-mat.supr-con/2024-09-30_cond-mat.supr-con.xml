      <title>Capping effects on spin and charge excitations in parent and superconducting Nd1-xSrxNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in infinite layer nickelates Nd1-xSrxNiO2 has so far been achieved only in thin films raising questions on the role of substrates and interfaces. Given the challenges associated with their synthesis it is imperative to identify their intrinsic properties. We use Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) to investigate the influence of the SrTiO3 capping layer on the excitations of Nd1-xSrxNiO2 (x = 0 and 0.2). Spin excitations are observed in parent and 20% doped Nd1-xSrxNiO2 regardless of capping, proving that magnetism is intrinsic to infinite-layer nickelates and appears in a significant fraction of their phase diagram. In parent and superconducting Nd1-xSrxNiO2, the spin excitations are slightly hardened in capped samples compared to the non-capped ones. Additionally, a weaker Ni - Nd charge transfer peak at ~ 0.6 eV suggests that the hybridization between Ni 3d and Nd 5d orbitals is reduced in capped samples. From our data, capping induces only minimal differences in Nd1-xSrxNiO2 and we phenomenologically discuss these differences based on the reconstruction of the SrTiO3 - NdNiO2 interface and other mechanisms such as crystalline disorder.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</description>

      <title>Correlation between unconventional superconductivity and strange metallicity revealed by operando superfluid density measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange-metal behavior has been observed in superconductors ranging from cuprates to pressurized nickelates, but its relationship to unconventional superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we perform operando superfluid density measurements on ion-gated FeSe films. We observe for the first time a synchronized evolution of superconducting condensate and the strange-metal phase with electron doping. A linear scaling between zero-temperature superfluid density and the strange-metal resistivity coefficient is further established, which nails down a direct link between the formation of superfluid in the superconducting state and the scattering of carriers in the strange-metal normal state. Remarkably, the scaling also applies for different iron-based and cuprate superconductors despite their distinct electronic structures and pairing symmetries. Such a correlation can be reproduced in a theoretical calculation on the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model by considering a cooperative effect of quantum critical fluctuation and disorder. These findings indicate a fundamental principle governing superconducting condensation and strange-metal scattering in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Keldysh-Usadel formalism unravels crossed Andreev reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a process that creates entanglement between spatially separated electrons and holes. Such entangled pairs have potential applications in quantum information processing, and it is therefore relevant to determine how the probability for CAR can be increased. CAR competes with another non-local process called elastic cotunneling (EC), which does not create entanglement. In conventional normal metal/superconductor/normal metal heterostructures, earlier theoretical work predicted that EC dominates over CAR. Nevertheless, we show numerically that when the Keldysh-Usadel equations are solved self-consistently in the superconductor, CAR can dominate over EC. Self-consistency is necessary both for the conversion from a quasiparticle current to a supercurrent and to describe the spatial variation of the order parameter correctly. A requirement for the CAR probability to surpass the EC probability is that the inverse proximity effect is small. Otherwise, the subvoltage density of states becomes large and EC is strengthened by quasiparticles flowing through the superconductor. Therefore, CAR becomes dominant in the non-local transport with increasing interface resistance and length of the superconducting region. Our results show that even the simplest possible experimental setup with easily accessible normal metals and superconductors can provide dominant CAR by designing the experimental parameters correctly. We also find that spin-splitting in the superconductor increases the subvoltage density of states, and thus always favors EC over CAR. Finally, we tune the chemical potential in the leads such that transport is governed by electrons of one spin type. This can increase the CAR probability at finite values of the spin-splitting compared to using a spin-degenerate voltage bias, and provides a way to control the spin of the conduction electrons electrically.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>

      <title>Stripes, pair density wave, and holon Wigner crystal in single-band Hubbard model on diagonal square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the Hubbard model on wide diagonal square cylinders, rotated by $\pi/4$ relative to the regular lattice orientation. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations with a large number of states, we convincingly demonstrate the development of a unidirectional charge density wave (CDW) characterized by infinite-length stripes along the primitive vector of square lattice in models with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'=-0.1\sim -0.3$ and doping $\delta \sim 14\%$. Intriguingly, analysis of pair-pair correlation functions along these stripes reveals incommensurate pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity with diverged susceptibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first controlled numerical evidence of dominant PDW in the single-band Hubbard model on square lattices. At lower doping $\delta \sim 10\%$, we observed the formation of an additional CDW order within each stripe, which aligns across different stripes, forming a holon Wigner crystal phase. The spin pattern retains antiferromagnetic stripes with anti-phase domain walls. The ordering momentum of this emerged CDW order is remarkably close to the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs in the PDW phase, suggesting a multifaceted relationship between CDW and PDW ordering.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Elementary Vortex Pinning in Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of practical superconductors and enables their diverse applications. However, the underlying mechanism of vortex pinning has long been elusive, lacking a clear microscopic explanation. Here using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy vortex bound states away from EF, creating a "mini" gap that effectively lowers the system energy and enhances pinning. By measuring the local density-of-states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and estimated the pinning force via the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The results are consistent with bulk critical current measurement. Furthermore, we show that a general microscopic quantum model incorporating defect-vortex interaction can naturally capture our observation. It suggests that the local pairing near pinned vortex core is actually enhanced compared to unpinned vortex, which is beyond the traditional understanding that non-superconducting regions pin vortices. Our study thus unveils a general microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning in superconductors, and provides insights for enhancing the critical current of practical superconductors.</description>

      <title>Evolution of dissipative regimes in atomically thin $\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{CaCu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$ superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoelectric transport has been widely used to study Abrikosov vortex dynamics in unconventional superconductors. However, only a few thermoelectric studies have been conducted near the dimensional crossover that occurs when the vortex-vortex interaction length scale becomes comparable to the sample size. Here we report the effects of finite size on the dissipation mechanisms of the Nernst effect in the optimally doped $\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{CaCu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$ high-temperature superconductor, down to the atomic length limit. To access this regime, we develop a new generation of thermoelectric chips based on silicon nitride microprinted circuit boards. These chips ensure optimized signals while preventing sample deterioration. Our results demonstrate that lateral confinement at the nanoscale can effectively reduce vortex dissipation. Investigating vortex dissipation at the micro- and nano-scale is essential for creating stable, miniaturized superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Low-energy optical sum-rule in moir\'e graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few layers of graphene at small twist-angles have emerged as a fascinating platform for studying the problem of strong interactions in regimes with a nearly quenched single-particle kinetic energy and non-trivial band topology. Starting from the strong-coupling limit of twisted bilayer graphene with a vanishing single-electron bandwidth and interlayer-tunneling between the same sublattice sites, we present an {\it exact} analytical theory of the Coulomb interaction-induced low-energy optical spectral weight at all {\it integer} fillings. In this limit, while the interaction-induced single-particle dispersion is finite, the optical spectral weight vanishes identically at integer fillings. We study corrections to the optical spectral weight by systematically including the effects of experimentally relevant strain-induced renormalization of the single-electron bandwidth and interlayer tunnelings between the same sublattice sites. Given the relationship between the optical spectral weight and the diamagnetic response that controls superconducting $T_c$, our results highlight the relative importance of specific parent insulating phases in enhancing the tendency towards superconductivity when doped away from integer fillings.</description>
