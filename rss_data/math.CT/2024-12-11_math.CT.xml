      <title>Enhanced 2-categorical structures, two-dimensional limit sketches and the symmetry of internalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many structures of interest in two-dimensional category theory have aspects that are inherently strict. This strictness is not a limitation, but rather plays a fundamental role in the theory of such structures. For instance, a monoidal fibration is - crucially - a strict monoidal functor, rather than a pseudo or lax monoidal functor. Other examples include monoidal double categories, double fibrations, and intercategories. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon from the perspective of enhanced 2-categories, which are 2-categories having a distinguished subclass of 1-cells representing the strict morphisms. As part of our development, we introduce enhanced 2-categorical limit sketches and explain how this setting addresses shortcomings in the theory of 2-categorical limit sketches. In particular, we establish the symmetry of internalisation for such structures, entailing, for instance, that a monoidal double category is equivalently a pseudomonoid in an enhanced 2-category of double categories, or a pseudocategory in an enhanced 2-category of monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is concrete, bicomplete, and symmetric closed monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vec}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: When $\mathcal C$ is pivotal, we prove that $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators perserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.</description>

      <title>On The Telescopic Picard Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any prime $p$ and height $n \ge 1$, the telescopic Picard group $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathrm{Sp}_{Tn})$ contains a subgroup of the form $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}/a_p(p^n-1)$, where $a_p = 1$ if $p = 2$ and $a_p = 2$ if $p$ is odd. Using Kummer theory, we obtain an $(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^\times \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/n)$-Galois extension of $\mathbb{S}_{T(n)}$, obtaining the first example of a lift of a non-Abelian Galois extension of the $K(n)$-local sphere to the telescopic world, at arbitrary positive height and prime. Our proof proceeds by setting up a higher categorical framework for the periodicity theorem, utilizing the symmetries of this framework to construct Picard elements.</description>

Abstract: C-systems were defined by Cartmell as the algebraic structures that correspond exactly to generalised algebraic theories. B-systems were defined by Voevodsky in his quest to formulate and prove an initiality conjecture for type theories. They play a crucial role in Voevodsky's construction of a syntactic C-system from a term monad.
  In this work, we construct an equivalence between the category of C-systems and the category of B-systems, thus proving a conjecture by Voevodsky. We construct this equivalence as the restriction of an equivalence between more general structures, called CE-systems and E-systems, respectively. To this end, we identify C-systems and B-systems as "stratified" CE-systems and E-systems, respectively; that is, systems whose contexts are built iteratively via context extension, starting from the empty context.</description>

      <title>Fiber 2-Functors and Tambara-Yamagami Fusion 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, a strong categorification of the notion of a group-theoretical fusion 1-category. Physically speaking, such fusion 2-categories arise by gauging subgroups of a global symmetry. We show that group-theoretical fusion 2-categories are completely characterized by the property that the braided fusion 1-category of endomorphisms of the monoidal unit is Tannakian. Then, we describe the underlying finite semisimple 2-category of group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and, more generally, of certain 2-categories of bimodules. We also partially describe the fusion rules of group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and investigate the group gradings of such fusion 2-categories. Using our previous results, we classify fusion 2-categories admitting a fiber 2-functor. Next, we study fusion 2-categories with a Tambara-Yamagami defect, that is $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded fusion 2-categories whose non-trivially graded factor is $\mathbf{2Vect}$. We classify these fusion 2-categories, and examine more closely the more restrictive notion of Tambara-Yamagami fusion 2-categories. Throughout, we give many examples to illustrate our various results.</description>

      <title>The Boolean spectrum of a Grothendieck category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A notion of support for objects in any Grothendieck category is introduced. This is based on the spectral category of a Grothendieck category and uses its Boolean lattice of localising subcategories. The support provides a classification of all subcategories that are closed under arbitrary coproducts, subobjects, and essential extensions. There is also a notion of exact support which classifies certain thick subcategories. As an application, the coproduct decompositions of objects are described in terms of Boolean lattices. Also, for any ring Crawley-Boevey's correspondence between definable subcategories of modules and closed subsets of the Ziegler spectrum is extended.</description>

      <title>Flat quasi-coherent sheaves as directed colimits, and quasi-coherent cotorsion periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every flat quasi-coherent sheaf on a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme is a directed colimit of locally countably presentable flat quasi-coherent sheaves. More generally, the same assertion holds for any countably quasi-compact, countably quasi-separated scheme. Moreover, for three categories of complexes of flat quasi-coherent sheaves, we show that all complexes in the category can be obtained as directed colimits of complexes of locally countably presentable flat quasi-coherent sheaves from the same category. In particular, on a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme, every flat quasi-coherent sheaf is a directed colimit of flat quasi-coherent sheaves of finite projective dimension. In the second part of the paper, we discuss cotorsion periodicity in category-theoretic context, generalizing an argument of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada. As the main application, we deduce the assertion that any cotorsion-periodic quasi-coherent sheaf on a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme is cotorsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify rank one 2-representations of SL2, GL2 and SO3 web categories. The classification is inspired by similar results about quantum groups, given by reducing the problem to the classification of bilinear and trilinear forms, and is formulated such that it can be adapted to other web categories.</description>

      <title>Cauchy identities for staircase matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Cauchy identity expresses the product of terms $(1 - x_i y_j)^{-1}$ for $(i,j)$ indexing entries of a rectangular $m\times n$-matrix as a sum over partitions $\lambda$ of products of Schur polynomials: $s_{\lambda}(x)s_{\lambda}(y)$. Algebraically, this identity comes from the decomposition of the symmetric algebra of the space of rectangular matrices, considered as a $\mathfrak{gl}_m$-$\mathfrak{gl}_n$-bi-module. We generalize the Cauchy decomposition by replacing rectangular matrices with arbitrary staircase-shaped matrices equipped with the left and right actions of the Borel upper-triangular subalgebras. For any given staircase shape $\mathsf{Y}$ we describe left and right "standard" filtrations on the symmetric algebra of the space of shape $\mathsf{Y}$ matrices. We show that the subquotients of these filtrations are tensor products of Demazure and opposite van der Kallen modules over the Borel subalgebras. On the level of characters, we derive three distinct expansions for the product $(1 - x_i y_j)^{-1}$ for $(i,j) \in \mathsf{Y}$. The first two expansions are sums of products of key polynomials $\kappa_\lambda(x)$ and (opposite) Demazure atoms $a^{\mu}(y)$. The third expansion is an alternating sum of products of key polynomials $\kappa_{\lambda}(x)\,\kappa^{\mu}(y)$.</description>
