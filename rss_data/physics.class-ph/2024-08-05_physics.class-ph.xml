      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling processes is presented and validated against finite element simulations. The model generalizes the classical Slab Method of cold rolling, and for the first time is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long-aspect-ratio roll gaps. The model is based on the asymptotic Method of Multiple-Scales, with the systematic assumptions of a long thin roll gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on the long length scale of the roll gap length $\hat{\ell}$, and matches with Slab Theory. The next-order correction varies on both the long length scale and the short length scale of the workpiece thickness $2\hat{h}_0$, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through-thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, the model is shown to compare well with finite element simulations using realistic elasticity and hardening material models. These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>
