      <title>BatSort: Enhanced Battery Classification with Transfer Learning for Battery Sorting and Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery recycling is a critical process for minimizing environmental harm and resource waste for used batteries. However, it is challenging, largely because sorting batteries is costly and hardly automated to group batteries based on battery types. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning-based approach for battery-type classification and address the daunting problem of data scarcity for the application. We propose BatSort which applies transfer learning to utilize the existing knowledge optimized with large-scale datasets and customizes ResNet to be specialized for classifying battery types. We collected our in-house battery-type dataset of small-scale to guide the knowledge transfer as a case study and evaluate the system performance. We conducted an experimental study and the results show that BatSort can achieve outstanding accuracy of 92.1% on average and up to 96.2% and the performance is stable for battery-type classification. Our solution helps realize fast and automated battery sorting with minimized cost and can be transferred to related industry applications with insufficient data.</description>

      <title>Neural networks can be FLOP-efficient integrators of 1D oscillatory integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that neural networks can be FLOP-efficient integrators of one-dimensional oscillatory integrands. We train a feed-forward neural network to compute integrals of highly oscillatory 1D functions. The training set is a parametric combination of functions with varying characters and oscillatory behavior degrees. Numerical examples show that these networks are FLOP-efficient for sufficiently oscillatory integrands with an average FLOP gain of 1000 FLOPs. The network calculates oscillatory integrals better than traditional quadrature methods under the same computational budget or number of floating point operations. We find that feed-forward networks of 5 hidden layers are satisfactory for a relative accuracy of 0.001. The computational burden of inference of the neural network is relatively small, even compared to inner-product pattern quadrature rules. We postulate that our result follows from learning latent patterns in the oscillatory integrands that are otherwise opaque to traditional numerical integrators.</description>

      <title>Martinize2 and Vermouth: Unified Framework for Topology Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the vermouth library, the martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network, and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard HT applications.</description>

      <title>Economical-Epidemiological Analysis of the Coffee Trees Rust Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coffee leaf rust is a prevalent botanical disease that causes a worldwide reduction in coffee supply and its quality, leading to immense economic losses. While several pandemic intervention policies (PIPs) for tackling this rust pandemic are commercially available, they seem to provide only partial epidemiological relief for farmers. In this work, we develop a high-resolution economical-epidemiological model that captures the rust pandemic's spread in coffee tree farms and its associated economic impact. Through extensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly of small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the world, our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any profit without directly tackling the rust pandemic. Furthermore, even in the hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological state and the weather in advance, any rust pandemic-related efforts can only amount to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case, any rust pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses, indicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are anticipated.</description>
