      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in machine learning on nuclear binding energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly employed in nuclear theory, however, the uncertainties that arise from the complex parameter manifold encoded by the neural networks are often overlooked. Epistemic uncertainties arising from training the same network multiple times for an ensemble of initial weight sets offer a first insight into the confidence of machine learning predictions, but they often come with a high computational cost. Instead, we apply a single-model uncertainty quantification method called {\Delta}-UQ that gives epistemic uncertainties with one-time training. We demonstrate our approach on a 2-feature model of nuclear binding energies per nucleon with proton and neutron number pairs as inputs. We show that {\Delta}-UQ can produce reliable and self-consistent epistemic uncertainty estimates and can be used to assess the degree of confidence in predictions made with deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group, which provides a fundamental framework for linking different scales. We uncover a universal transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This work establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <title>Lepton capture rates due to isotopes of vanadium in astrophysical environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lepton (electron and positron) capture rates on iron-regime nuclei are an essential element for modeling the late stages in the evolution of massive stars that end as core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae. Previous simulation studies suggest that lepton capture (LC) rates on isotopes of vanadium have a substantial effect in regulating the electron fraction (Ye) during the final evolutionary phases. The present work involves the calculation of LC rates for 22 isotopes of vanadium using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The considered mass range is from A = 43 to 64. The LC rates are computed over stellar densities ranging from 10^1 to 10^11 g/cm^3 and temperatures in the range 10^7 to 3 x 10^10 K. A comparison of our LC rates with those obtained using other models (IPM and LSSM) is also presented. Compared to other models, the pn-QRPA rates at high temperature (3 x 10^10 K) are larger by 1-2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Structure Properties of even-even Chromium Isotopes and the E ect of Deformation on Calculated Electron Capture Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the role of nuclear deformation on the calculated electron capture cross section (ECC) of even-even chromium (Cr) isotopes. We first determined the nuclear structure properties of these nuclei within the interacting boson model-1 (IBM-1). The energy spectra and E2 transition probabilities were calculated by fitting the parameters in the model formalism. The analysis of the potential energy surface was also performed to predict the geometric shape of the Cr nuclei by plotting their contour plot in the plane of (beta, gamma) deformation parameters. Later, we calculated the ECC within the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. In particular, we studied how the calculated ECC changed with different values of the nuclear deformation parameter. The calculated Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions were widely spread among the daughter states. The total GT strength decreased with increasing value of the beta parameter. The computed ECC values, however, increased with increasing beta values of the Cr isotopes.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure properties and decay rates of molybdenum isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron capture and beta-minus decay are the dominant decay processes during the late phases of the evolution of heavy stars. Previous simulation results show that weak rates on isotopes of Molybdenum (Mo) have a meaningful contribution during the development of phases of stars before they go supernova. The relative abundance, coupled with the stellar weak rates on Mo isotopes, may change the lepton-to-baryon content of the core material. Here, we report on the calculation of nuclear structure properties of Mo isotopes from mass number 82 to 138, employing the RMF model. Later, we calculate the weak decay rates of these isotopes using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. In the first step, the ground-state nuclear properties of Mo isotopes such as binding energy per nucleon, neutron and proton separation energies, charge radii, total electric quadrupole moments, and the deformation parameter of electric quadrupole moments have been calculated using the density-dependent version of the RMF model with DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 functionals. The calculated electric quadrupole deformation parameters have been used in a deformed pn-QRPA calculation in the second phase of this work to calculate half-lives and weak decay rates for these Mo isotopes in stellar matter. We calculate the electron capture and beta-decay rates over an extensive range of temperature (0.01 x 10^9 K to 30 x 10^9 K) and density (10 to 10^11 g/cm^3). Our study can prove useful for simulation of presupernova evolution processes of stars.</description>

      <title>Unified treatment for in-medium light and heavy clusters with RMF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown that light nuclei such as $^4$He, $^8$Be, and $^{12}$C can be well described by RMF models, which enables a unified description for nuclei with baryon numbers $A\gtrsim4$. In this work, we propose a hybrid treatment for investigating the clustering phenomenon in nuclear medium, where clusters ranging from light nuclei (e.g., $^3$H, $^3$He, and $^4$He) to heavy ones (e.g., $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb) can be treated in a unified manner. In particular, assuming a spherical Wigner-Seitz cell, the clusters are fixed by solving the Dirac equations imposing the Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition, while the nuclear medium are treated with Thomas-Fermi approximation and take constant densities. In the presence of nuclear medium, the clusters eventually become unbound as density increases, while the root-mean-square charge radii increase. For clusters with different proton and neutron numbers $N_p \neq N_n$, their binding energies varies with the proton fraction of nuclear medium, which are less significant for clusters with $N_p = N_n$. The uncertainties of density functionals on the clustering phenomenon are investigated as well adopting 8 different functionals. Based on the obtained results, an analytical formula describing the binding energies of in-medium clusters is then obtained. The results presented in this work should be useful to understand the clustering phenomenon in both heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent random phase approximation for particle-number fluctuations and correlations in deep-inelastic collisions of $^{144}$Sm+$^{144}$Sm and $^{154}$Sm+$^{154}$Sm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation mechanism underlying non-equilibrium transport in low-energy heavy-ion reactions remains unclear. Although the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method provides a reasonable description of average reaction outcomes and one-body dissipation, it is known to significantly underestimate fluctuations of observables. The purpose of this work is to investigate deep-inelastic collisions of 144Sm+144Sm and 154Sm+154Sm with microscopic mean-field approaches and to show a predominant role of one-body dissipation as well as one-body fluctuations and correlation in low-energy heavy-ion reactions. Three dimensional TDHF calculations are carried out for 144Sm+144Sm at Ecm=500 MeV and 154Sm+154Sm at Ecm=485 MeV for a range of impact parameters with Skyrme SLy5 energy density functional. Backward time evolutions are performed as well to evaluate fluctuations and correlation in nucleon numbers within time-dependent random phase approximation (TDRPA). With TDRPA we calculate mass- and charge-number fluctuations, as well as the correlation between neutron and proton transfers, for each impact parameter. We demonstrate that TDRPA quantitatively reproduces the experimental \sigma_{AA}^2-TKEL distributions, whereas it systematically underestimates the charge fluctuation, \sigma_{ZZ}. The double-differential cross sections of reaction products are calculated, showing good agreement with the experimental data. We confirm a long-thought characteristic property that the closed-shell structure limits nucleon transfer at small energy losses, based on our microscopic TDHF and TDRPA calculations.</description>

      <title>Implication of shell quenching in scandium isotopes around N=20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shell closure structures are commonly observed phenomena associated with nuclear charge radii throughout the nuclide chart. Inspired by recent studies demonstrating that the abrupt change can be clearly observed in the charge radii of the scandium isotopic chain across the neutron number $N=20$, we further review the underlying mechanism of the enlarged charge radii for $^{42}$Sc based on the covariant density functional theory. The pairing correlations are tackled by solving the state-dependent Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equations. Meanwhile, the neutron-proton correlation around the Fermi surface derived from the simultaneously unpaired proton and neutron is appropriately considered in describing the systematic evolution of nuclear charge radii. The calculated results suggest that the abrupt increase in charge radii across the $N=20$ shell closure seems to be improved along the scandium isotopic chain if the strong neutron-proton correlation is properly included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a vibrational interpretation and good U(5) symmetry are maintained for the majority of low-lying normal states in $^{110,112,114,116}$Cd isotopes, consistent with the empirical data. The observed deviations from this paradigm are properly treated by an interacting boson model Hamiltonian which breaks the U(5) symmetry in selected non-yrast states, while securing a weak mixing with coexisting SO(6)-like intruder states. The results demonstrate the relevance of the U(5) partial dynamical symmetry notion to this series of isotopes.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the GUDE functionals which consist of pion exchanges derived from chiral effective field theory and a Skyrme-like part. Certain pion terms lead to significant improvements in the description of ground-state energies, indicating they might be useful ingredients for true ab initio energy density functionals. In addition, we present estimates of the statistical parameter uncertainties of the GUDE functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brief excursion into the three-body problem is presented for graduate students in nuclear physics or anyone at a similar stage. Starting from single-particle coordinates, a step-by-step derivation of the Shcr\"{o}dinger equation in Jacobi coordinates is outlined. Laplace operators are explicitly transformed through the chain rule for multivariable calculus. The transformation of Faddeev equations from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates is elaborated upon. In all transformations (from single-particle coordinates to Jacobi coordinates, rotation between Jacobi coordinates and from Jacobi coordinates to hyperspherical coordinates) the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is computed to show how volume elements transform. The projection of Faddeev equations on a hyperspherical harmonics basis is explicitly carried out to obtain the coupled hyperradial equations that define the hyperspherical harmonics method.</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb-nuclear breakup of 6,7Li projectiles with heavy deformed 232Th target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of both Coulomb and nuclear couplings and their interference effects in the breakup processes of 6,7Li with a non-spherical nucleus 232Th has been evaluated. The continuum discretized coupled channel(CDCC) calculations are carried out in a nonstandard way, using short-range imaginary potentials for the fragment-target interaction at energies close to the Coulomb barrier. The present calculations employing short-range imaginary potentials exhibit better agreement with the experimental elastic scattering angular distributions than those using standard systematic value (0.78xWSPP ) used to describe elastic scattering. Including the excitation of the 232Th inelastic shows significant coupling effects on the elastic scattering below the barrier energies compared to higher incident energies. Subsequently, the CDCC framework was used to analyze the nuclear, Coulomb, and total breakup predictions separately. The breakup cross sections for the 6Li+232Th system are greater than those for the 7Li+232Th system across various energies. The present study predicts destructive Coulomb-nuclear interference in the breakup processes involving both 6Li and 7Li projectile nuclei with the deformed 232Th target. Additionally, the breakup reaction cross-sections are compared with experimentally measured fusion cross-sections near the barrier energies for both 6,7Li+232Th systems.</description>

      <title>Universality of $SU(\infty)$ relaxation dynamics for $SU(n_f)$-symmetric spin-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-models, where the $N$ spins interact pairwise with a $SU(n_f)$ symmetry preserving hamiltonian, famously simplify in the large $n_f$, $N$ limits, as derived by Sachdev and Ye when exploring mean-field behavior of spin-glasses. We present numerical evidence that for a large class of models, the large $n_f$ limit is not necessary: the same dynamical equations can describe the relaxation processes at high temperatures for a set of classical models inspired from mean-field treatments of interacting dense neutrino gases, up to times set by the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the correlation function. After a simple rescaling of time, the dynamics display a surprising universality, being identical for any value of $n_f$ as long as the rank of the coupling matrix is small. As a corollary of our results, we find that the direct interaction approximation originating from the study of stochastic flows in fluid turbulence should be thought of as only a short-time approximation for generic random coupling systems.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy for exotic hadrons and nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In high energy collision experiments with multiple hadron productions, the momentum distribution of the measured hadron pair shows a correlation due to the final state hadron interactions and the quantum statistics. In the past, this femtoscopy technique has been developed to extract the information of the emission source from the momentum correlation functions. Recently, correlation function measurement is utilized also as a new method to determine the hadron interactions. In fact, the ALICE collaboration at LHC measures the correlation functions with various hadron pairs, for which the standard scattering experiment is difficult, providing remarkable progress in the study of the hadron interactions. In this contribution, we introduce the theoretical method to calculate the correlation functions, and present recent results on the study of the antikaon-nucleon interactions and hyperon-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Event shape dependence of symmetry plane correlations using the Gaussian estimator in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC using AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetry plane correlations (SPCs) can be useful in characterizing the direction of the anisotropic emission of produced particles in the final state. The study of SPCs provides an independent method to understand the transport properties of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions. Similar to anisotropic flow coefficients, which are largely influenced by the initial spatial anisotropy, SPCs also depend upon the participant plane correlation measured using the participating nucleons of the collision overlap region. In this paper, SPCs have been studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV using the event generator AMPT. In addition to their behaviour with the changing centrality of the collision, their event shape dependence has also been studied for the first time, using the event shape classifier transverse spherocity. The Gaussian estimator has been used to evaluate the correlations, and these have been compared to the participant plane correlations defined in an analogous way to the symmetry plane correlations and a qualitative match has been found between them. These event-shape differentiated symmetry plane correlations can be used to deduce the presence of higher-order anisotropies in the initial energy distribution, thus giving insight into the initial geometry of the colliding system, among other applications like model development and model testing using Bayesian analyses.</description>

      <title>Extracting Meson Distribution Amplitudes from Nonlocal Euclidean Correlations at Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first complete result for the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) hard matching kernel indispensable for a precision extraction of light meson distribution amplitudes from lattice calculations of equal-time nonlocal Euclidean correlation functions. The results are given in both coordinate and momentum space, with the renormalization and matching accomplished in a state-of-the-art scheme. Our results can be used in both large-momentum effective theory and short-distance factorization approaches. Notably, our coordinate space kernel is directly applicable to nonsinglet quark unpolarized and helicity generalized parton distributions as well. We also illustrate the numerical impact of the NNLO matching, using the pion distribution amplitude as an example.</description>

      <title>Prompt and non-prompt production of charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we use machine learning (ML) based models to separate the prompt and non-prompt production of heavy flavour hadrons, such as $D^0$ and J/$\psi$, in proton-proton collisions at LHC energies. For this purpose, we use PYTHIA~8 to generate events, which provides a good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements of charm hadron production. The input features for the ML models are experimentally measurable. The prediction accuracy of the ML models used in this study reaches up to 99\%. The ML models can be useful in providing precise track-level identification, which is not possible in experiments with traditional methods. The contribution also discusses future applications of the ML models to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt heavy quark hadrons.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Baryon Stopping at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon exhibits a rich internal structure governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), where its electric charge arises from valence quarks, while its spin and mass emerge from complex interactions among valence quarks, sea (anti-)quarks, and gluons. At the advent of QCD, an alternative hypothesis emerged suggesting, at high energies, the transport of a nucleon's baryon number could be traced by a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields connecting its three valence quarks, forming a $Y$-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. Recent measurements by the STAR experiment are compatible with this scenario. In light of these measurements, this study aims to explore the mechanisms of baryon transport in high-energy nuclear collisions using the PYTHIA-8 framework, which incorporates a state-of-the-art hadronization model with advanced Color Flow (CF) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanisms which mimic signatures of a baryon junction. Within this model setup, we investigate (i) the rapidity slope of the net-baryon distributions in photon-included processes ($\gamma$+p) and (ii) baryon over charge transport in the isobaric (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. Our study highlights the importance of the CF and CR mechanisms in PYTHIA-8, which plays a crucial role in baryon transport. The results show that the CF and CR schemes significantly affect the isobaric baryon-to-charge ratio, leading to different predictions for baryon stopping and underscoring the need to account for CF and CR effects in comparisons with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the deuteron mass radius via near-threshold $\rho^0$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ meson photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the near-threshold photoproduction of the $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons on a deuterium target, leveraging published datasets from the DESY and SLAC facilities. In our extraction of the deuteron mass radius, we employ a dipole-form scalar gravitational form factor to effectively model the $|t|$-dependence of the differential cross sections associated with vector meson photoproductions. Utilizing the vector-meson dominance model alongside a low-energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theorem assumption, we derive the deuteron mass radius from the near-threshold photoproduction data of the $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ mesons. The mass radii obtained from various datasets demonstrate consistency within the statistical uncertainties, yielding an average value of $2.07 \pm 0.15$ fm. This precision surpasses previous estimates solely based on the $\phi$ meson photoproduction data. Our findings provide novel constraints for theoretical nuclear structure models and significantly enhance our understanding of the mass distribution within the deuteron.</description>

      <title>Probing the Sivers Asymmetry with Transverse Energy-Energy Correlators in the Small-$x$ Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate transverse energy-energy correlators (TEECs) for both polarized and unpolarized targets in the small-$x$ regime at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Focusing on the approximately back-to-back electroproduction of a hadron-electron pair, we apply transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization formulas that incorporate TMD evolution for both event-shape observables and expand them in terms of the small-$x$ dipole amplitude. This allows us to write the TEEC off the transversely polarized proton in terms of a C-odd interaction, corresponding to an odderon exchange. Due to the charge-conjugation-odd nature of the small-$x$ quark Sivers function, we restrict the sum over final hadronic states to positively and negatively charged hadrons separately. We present numerical predictions for the TEEC Sivers asymmetry at the EIC and find the magnitude of the asymmetry to be on the $0.1 \%$ level. This channel offers a promising avenue for benchmarking the still largely unconstrained odderon amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are important quantities in describing nucleon structures. They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of the nucleonic states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or multi-nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. Compared with the experimental data, we find that dPDFs can explain the behaviour of the EMC effect. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\sin^2\theta_W$ by using dPDFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of conducting low-energy nuclear physics studies, including nuclear structure and decay, at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and $eA$ scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies. However, we have also shown that the fragmentation cross-sections at the EIC are about 1,000 times smaller than those at the LHC. At the LHC, the fragmentation of uranium nuclei displays characteristic double-hump mass distributions from fission events, while at the EIC, fragmentation is dominated by neutron emission and fewer few fission products, about 10,000 smaller number of events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies $\bar{p}$-Ca atom spectra in light of the strong shifts and level widths, using the optical model with several types of parametric coefficients. The spectroscopic quantities are obtained as the eigenvalues of the Dirac equation, where the nuclear densities computed via nuclear Density Functional Theory and the effect of the anomalous magnetic moment are incorporated. The results indicate that the isovector term's contribution to the optical potential is crucial for explaining the systematical differences in the strong shifts between $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. Furthermore, it is found that both the strong shifts and the level widths exhibit significant dependence on the nuclear density profiles. These findings provide critical insights into the nuclear structures, particularly in the context of Calcium isotopes, by offering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying nuclear-hadron properties.</description>

      <title>Properties of a kaon-condensed phase in hyperon-mixed matter with three-baryon forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coexistent phase of kaon condensates and hyperons [($Y$+$K$) phase] in beta equilibrium with electrons and muons is investigated as a possible form of dense hadronic phase with multi-strangeness. The effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon-baryon and kaon-kaon interactions is utilized within chiral symmetry approach in combination with the interaction model between baryons. For the baryon-baryon interactions, we adopt the minimal relativistic mean-field theory with exchange of scalar mesons and vector mesons between baryons without including the nonlinear self-interacting meson field terms. In addition, the universal three-baryon repulsion and the phenomenological three-nucleon attraction are introduced as density-dependent effective two-body potentials. The repulsive effects leading to stiff equation of state at high densities consist of both the two-baryon repulsion via the vector-meson exchange and the universal three-baryon repulsion. Interplay of kaon condensates with hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense matter is clarified, and resulting onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase and characteristic features of the system are presented. It is shown that the slope $L$ of the symmetry energy controls the two-baryon repulsion beyond the saturation density and resulting stiffness of the equation of state. The stiffness of the equation of state in turn controls admixture of hyperons and the onset and development of kaon condensates as a result of competing effect between kaon condensates and hyperons. The equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase becomes stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. Static properties of neutron stars with the ($Y$+$K$) phase are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EOS constraints within an instantaneous nonlocal chiral quark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: (1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, \mbox{(2) the maximum} mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than \mbox{2.0 M$_\odot$} and (3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between 0.5-0.7 $M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range 2.15-2.22 $M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of 1.2-2.0 $M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>

      <title>SU(3) analysis for B(E2) anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: B(E2) anomaly is becoming a hot topic in the field of nuclear structure. Since the B(E2) anomaly was experimentally found, understanding the mechanism of its production has become an important problem. Theoretical studies have found that the SU3-IBM and other extended IBM theories can give explanations, but different mechanisms were found. In this paper, the concept ``SU(3) analysis'' for B(E2) anomaly is proposed, and some new conclusions are obtained. The SU(3) third-order interaction $[L\times Q \times L]^{(0)}$ and level-crossing are both vital for the emergence of the B(E2) anomaly. This technique can help us to better understand the realistic reason of the B(E2) anomaly.</description>

      <title>Double shape quantum phase transitions in the SU3-IBM: new $\gamma$-soft phase and the shape phase transition from the new $\gamma$-soft phase to the prolate shape</title>

Abstract: Shape quantum phase transition is an important topic in nuclear structure. In this paper, we begin to study the shape quantum phase transition in the SU3-IBM. In this new proposed model, spherical-like spectra was found to resolve the spherical nucleus puzzle, which is a new $\gamma$-soft rotational mode. In this paper, the shape phase transition along the new $\gamma$-soft line is first discussed, and then the neighbouring case at the prolate side is also studied. We find that double shape phase transitions occur along a single parameter path. The new $\gamma$-softness is really a shape phase and the shape phase transition from the new $\gamma$-soft phase to the prolate shape is found. The experimental support is also found and $^{108}$Pd may be the critical nucleus.</description>

      <title>Magnetic moments of $\frac{1}{2}^-$ baryon resonances in hot and dense strange hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work primarily focusses on determining the magnetic moments of $\frac{1}{2}^-$ baryon resonances in the presence of hot and dense hadronic matter. In the chiral $SU(3)$ quark mean field model approach, we have essentially accounted for the effects on in-medium scalar meson fields to investigate the impact of high densities on the in-medium baryon masses and their constituent quarks. In light of chiral constituent quark model $\chi$CQM, we have calculated the magnetic moments of $\frac{1}{2}^-$ baryon resonances and scrutinized the effects due to its internal constituents: the valence quarks, sea quarks and the orbital moment of sea quarks. Furthermore, we have investigated the effective baryonic magnetic moments for the finite magnitudes of isospin asymmetry and strangeness fraction.</description>

      <title>Gluons in the $\eta'$ and in nucleon resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of gluon dynamics in $\eta'$ physics and in nucleon resonances where excitations of gluonic potentials may also be important. Interesting phenomenology includes a possible narrow near threshold resonance in $\eta'$ photoproduction and whether the parity doublets observed in the higher mass nucleon resonance spectrum might be hinting at a possible second minimum in the confinement potential corresponding to supercritical confinement.</description>

      <title>Correlations between the Neutron Star Mass-Radius Relation and the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic method of inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) relations to high accuracy. In principle, a specified $\mathcal{E}\mbox{-}P$ relation gives a unique $M\mbox{-}R$ relation, and vice-versa. Our method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>
