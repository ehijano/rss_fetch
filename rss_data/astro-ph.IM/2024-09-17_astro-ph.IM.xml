      <title>Understanding posterior projection effects with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern applications of Bayesian inference, such as in cosmology, are based on complicated forward models with high-dimensional parameter spaces. This considerably limits the sampling of posterior distributions conditioned on observed data. In turn, this reduces the interpretability of posteriors to their one- and two-dimensional marginal distributions, when more information is available in the full dimensional distributions. We show how to learn smooth and differentiable representations of posterior distributions from their samples using normalizing flows, which we train with an added evidence error loss term, to improve accuracy in multiple ways. Motivated by problems from cosmology, we implement a robust method to obtain one and two-dimensional posterior profiles. These are obtained by optimizing, instead of integrating, over other parameters, and are thus less prone than marginals to so-called projection effects. We also demonstrate how this representation provides an accurate estimator of the Bayesian evidence, with log error at the 0.2 level, allowing accurate model comparison. We test our method on multi-modal mixtures of Gaussians up to dimension 32 before applying it to simulated cosmology examples.

      <title>On the Potential of Spectroastrometry with Photonic Lanterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of photonic lantern (PL) fiber fed spectrometers for two-dimensional spectroastrometry. Spectroastrometry, a technique for studying small angular scales by measuring centroid shifts as a function of wavelength, is typically conducted using long-slit spectrographs. However, slit-based spectroastrometry requires observations with multiple position angles to measure two-dimensional spectroastrometric signals. In a typical configuration of PL-fed spectrometers, light from the focal plane is coupled into the few-moded PL, which is then split into several single-mode outputs, with the relative intensities containing astrometric information. The single-moded beams can be fed into a high-resolution spectrometer to measure wavelength-dependent centroid shifts. We perform numerical simulations of a standard 6-port PL and demonstrate its capability of measuring spectroastrometric signals. The effects of photon noise, wavefront errors, and chromaticity are investigated. When the PL is designed to have large linear responses to tip-tilts at the wavelengths of interest, the centroid shifts can be efficiently measured. Furthermore, we provide mock observations of detecting accreting protoplanets. PL spectroastrometry is potentially a simple and efficient technique for detecting spectroastrometric signals.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dimensionality Reduction of SDSS Spectral Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution stellar spectra offer valuable insights into atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions. However, their inherent complexity and high-dimensionality present challenges in fully utilizing the information they contain. In this study, we utilize data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) to explore latent representations of chemical abundances by applying five dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, Autoencoder, and VAE. Through this exploration, we evaluate the preservation of information and compare reconstructed outputs with the original 19 chemical abundance data. Our findings reveal a performance ranking of PCA &lt; UMAP &lt; t-SNE &lt; VAE &lt; Autoencoder, through comparing their explained variance under optimized MSE. The performance of non-linear (Autoencoder and VAE) algorithms has approximately 10\% improvement compared to linear (PCA) algorithm. This difference can be referred to as the "non-linearity gap." Future work should focus on incorporating measurement errors into extension VAEs, thereby enhancing the reliability and interpretability of chemical abundance exploration in astronomical spectra.</description>

      <title>Observers' Data Access Portal: Realtime Streaming for Astronomical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The W. M. Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) has released the Observers Data Access Portal (ODAP), a web-application that delivers astronomical data from the W. M. Keck Observatory to the scheduled program's principal investigator and their collaborators anywhere in the world in near real-time. Data files and their associated metadata are streamed to a user's desktop machine moments after they are written to disk and archived in KOA. The ODAP User Interface is built in React and uses the WebSocket protocol to stream data between KOA and the user. This document describes the design of the tool, challenges encountered, shows how ODAP is integrated into the Keck observing model, and provides an analysis of usage metrics.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Binary Classification Via Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric binary candidates have risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to automatically classify whether a set of stars belong to an astrometric binary pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia DR3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores, with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991, and an AUC of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of astrometric binaries.</description>

      <title>ANNZ+: an enhanced photometric redshift estimation algorithm with applications on the PAU Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ANNZ is a fast and simple algorithm which utilises artificial neural networks (ANNs), it was known as one of the pioneers of machine learning approaches to photometric redshift estimation decades ago. We enhanced the algorithm by introducing new activation functions like tanh, softplus, SiLU, Mish and ReLU variants; its new performance is then vigorously tested on legacy samples like the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Stripe-82 samples from SDSS, as well as modern galaxy samples like the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). This work focuses on testing the robustness of activation functions with respect to the choice of ANN architectures, particularly on its depth and width, in the context of galaxy photometric redshift estimation. Our upgraded algorithm, which we named ANNZ+, shows that the tanh and Leaky ReLU activation functions provide more consistent and stable results across deeper and wider architectures with &gt; 1 per cent improvement in root-mean-square error ($\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$) and 68th percentile error ($\sigma_{68}$) when tested on SDSS data sets. While assessing its capabilities in handling high dimensional inputs, we achieved an improvement of 11 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$ and 6 per cent in $\sigma_{68}$ with the tanh activation function when tested on the 40-narrowband PAUS dataset; it even outperformed ANNZ2, its supposed successor, by 44 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$. This justifies the effort to upgrade the 20-year-old ANNZ, allowing it to remain viable and competitive within the photo-z community today. The updated algorithm ANNZ+ is publicly available at https://github.com/imdadmpt/ANNzPlus.</description>

      <title>Precision speckle interferometry with CMOS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speckle polarimeter (SPP) is a facility instrument of the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of SAI MSU. By design it is a combination of a speckle interferometer and a dual--beam polarimeter. In 2022 we performed a major upgrade of the instrument. New version of the instrument features Hamamatsu ORCA-Quest qCMOS C15550-20UP, having subelectron readout noise, as a main detector, as opposed to EMCCD Andor iXon 897 used in previous version. Optical distortions present in the instrument are considered as they directly affect the accuracy of the speckle interferometric astrometric measurements of binary stars. We identified the Atmospheric Dispersion Compensator (ADC) as the main source of distortions which are not constant and depend on the rotational angles of ADCs prisms. Distortions are estimated using internal calibration light source and multiple binary stars measurements. Method for their correction is developed. Flux ratio estimates are subject to CMOS-specific negative factors: spatially correlated noise and flux-dependent pixel-to-pixel sensitivity difference. We suggest ways to mitigate these factors. The use of speckle transfer function measured using a reference star further improves flux ratio estimation performance. We discuss the precision of the estimates of position angle, separation and flux ratio of binary stars.</description>

      <title>Real-bogus scores for active anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the task of anomaly detection in modern time-domain photometric surveys, the primary goal is to identify astrophysically interesting, rare, and unusual objects among a large volume of data. Unfortunately, artifacts -- such as plane or satellite tracks, bad columns on CCDs, and ghosts -- often constitute significant contaminants in results from anomaly detection analysis. In such contexts, the Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) algorithm allows tailoring the output of anomaly detection pipelines according to what the expert judges to be scientifically interesting. We demonstrate how the introduction real-bogus scores, obtained from a machine learning classifier, improves the results from AAD. Using labeled data from the SNAD ZTF knowledge database, we train four real-bogus classifiers: XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Trees. All the models perform real-bogus classification with similar effectiveness, achieving ROC-AUC scores ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. Consequently, we select the Random Forest model as the main model due to its simplicity and interpretability. The Random Forest classifier is applied to 67 million light curves from ZTF DR17. The output real-bogus score is used as an additional feature for two anomaly detection algorithms: static Isolation Forest and AAD. While results from Isolation Forest remained unchanged, the number of artifacts detected by the active approach decreases significantly with the inclusion of the real-bogus score, from 27 to 3 out of 100. We conclude that incorporating the real-bogus classifier result as an additional feature in the active anomaly detection pipeline significantly reduces the number of artifacts in the outputs, thereby increasing the incidence of astrophysically interesting objects presented to human experts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light pollution is a growing environmental issue that affects astronomy, ecosystems, human health. To address this, we introduce the Free Dark Sky Meter (FreeDSM), an affordable IoT-based photometer designed for continuous light pollution monitoring. FreeDSM uses an ESP32 microcontroller with integrated sensors for light, temperature, and humidity, and operates on an open-source platform. Data from multiple devices are centralized and processed using the Gambons model, which leverages Gaia satellite data for accurate real-time assessments of natural light levels. This project is part of the Gaia4Sustainability initiative.</description>

      <title>J-UBIK: The JAX-accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from multiple instruments. To facilitate the high-fidelity imaging of these signals, we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we present J-UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the JAX-accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J-UBIK streamlines the implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X-ray observations, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for the near- and mid-infrared. The aim is to expand this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J-UBIK enables efficient generation of high-fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored to specific research objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of Sherpa, an open source Python project, and discuss its development history, broad design concepts and capabilities. Sherpa contains powerful tools for combining parametric models into complex expressions that can be fit to data using a variety of statistics and optimization methods. It is easily extensible to include user-defined models, statistics, and optimization methods. It provides a high-level User Interface for interactive data-analysis, such as within a Jupyter notebook, and it can also be used as a library component, providing fitting and modeling capabilities to an application. We include a few examples of Sherpa applications to multiwavelength astronomical data. The code is available GitHub: https://github.com/sherpa/sherpa</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Focus diverse phase retrieval test results on broadband continuous wavefront sensing in space telescope applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous wavefront sensing benefits space observatories in on-orbit optical performance maintenance. To measure the phase of a wavefront, phase retrieval is an attractive technique as it uses multiple point spread function (PSF) images that are acquired by the telescope itself without extra metrology systems nor complicated calibration. The focus diverse phase retrieval utilizes PSFs from predetermined defocused positions to enhance the dynamic range of the algorithm. We describe an updated visible light active optics testbed with the addition of a linear motorized focus stage. The performance of the phase retrieval algorithm in broadband is tested under various cases. While broadband pass filters have advantages in higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the performance of phase retrieval can be restricted due to blurred image caused by diffraction and increased computing cost. We used multiple bandpass filters (10 nm, 88 nm, and 150 nm) and investigated effects of bandwidth on the accuracy and required image acquisition conditions such as SNR, reaching accuracies below 20 nm RMS wavefront error at the widest bandwidth. We also investigated the dynamic range of the phase retrieval algorithm depending on the bandwidth and required amount of defocus to expand dynamic range. Finally, we simulated the continuous wavefront sensing and correction loop with a range of statistically generated representative telescope disturbance time series to test for edge cases.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Knobs and dials of retrieving JWST transmission spectra. I. The importance of p-T profile complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of using multipoint p-T profiles of varying complexity on the retrieval of synthetically generated hot Jupiter transmission spectra modelled after state-of-the-art observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-39~b with JWST. We perform homogenised atmospheric retrievals with the TauREx retrieval framework on a sample of synthetically generated transmission spectra, accounting for varying cases of underlying p-T profiles, cloud-top pressures, and expected noise levels. These retrievals are performed using a fixed-pressure multipoint p-T prescription with increasing complexity, ranging from isothermal to an eleven-point profile. We evaluate the performance of the retrievals based on the Bayesian model evidence, and the accuracy of the retrievals compared to the known input parameters. We find that performing atmospheric retrievals using an isothermal prescription for the pressure-temperature profile consistently results in wrongly retrieved atmospheric parameters when compared to the known input parameters. For an underlying p-T profile with a fully positive lapse rate, we find that a two-point profile is sufficient to retrieve the known atmospheric parameters, while under the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion, we find that a more complex profile is necessary. Our investigation shows that, for a data quality scenario mirroring state-of-the-art observations of a hot Jupiter with JWST, an isothermal p-T prescription is insufficient to correctly retrieve the known atmospheric parameters. We find a model complexity preference dependent on the underlying pressure-temperature structure, but argue that a p-T prescription on the complexity level of a four-point profile should be preferred. This represents the overlap between the lowest number of free parameters and highest model preference in the cases investigated in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication of dielectrics at low temperature is required for temperature-sensitive detectors. For superconducting detectors, such as transition edge sensors and kinetic inductance detectors, AlMn is widely studied due to its variable superconducting transition temperature at different baking temperatures. Experimentally only the highest baking temperature determines AlMn transition temperature, so we need to control the wafer temperature during the whole process. In general, the highest process temperature happens during dielectric fabrication. Here, we present the cryogenic microwave performance of Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$, SiN$_{x}$ and $\alpha$-Si using ICPCVD at low temperature of 75 $^{\circ}$C. The dielectric constant, internal quality factor and TLS properties are studied using Al parallel plate resonators.</description>

      <title>Classifications for Exoplanet and Exoplanetary Systems -- Could it be developed? I. Exoplanet classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a star is described as a spectral class G2V, we know its approximate mass, temperature, age, and size. At more than 5,700 exoplanets discovered, it is a natural developmental step to establish a classification for them, such as for example, the Harvard classification for stars. This exoplanet classification has to be easily interpreted and present the most relevant information about them and divides them into groups based on certain characteristics. We propose an exoplanet classification, which using an easily readable code, may inform you about a exoplanet's main characteristics. The suggested classification code contains four parameters by which we can quickly determine the range of temperature, mass, density and their eccentricity. The first parameter concerns the mass of an exoplanet in the form of the units of the mass of other known planets, where e.g. M represents the mass of Mercury, E that of Earth, N Neptune, or J Jupiter. The second parameter is the mean Dyson temperature of the extoplanet's orbit, for which we established four main classes: F represents the Frozen class, W the Water class, G the Gaseous class, and R the Roaster class. The third parameter is eccentricity and the fourth parameter is surface attribute which is defined as the bulk density of the exoplanet, where g represents a gaseous planet, w - water planet, t - terrestrial planet, i - iron planet and s - super dense planet. The classification code for Venus, could be EG0t (E - mass in the range of the mass of the Earth, G - Gaseous class, temperature in the range from 450 to 1000 K, 0 - circular or nearly circular orbit, t - terrestrial surface), for Earth it could be EW0t (W - Water class - a possible Habitable zone). This classification is very helpful in, for example, quickly delimiting if a planet can be found in the Habitable zone; if it is terrestrial or not.</description>

      <title>Exploring the time variability of the Solar Wind using LOFAR pulsar data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision pulsar timing is highly dependent on precise and accurate modeling of any effects that impact the data. It was shown that commonly used Solar Wind models do not accurately account for variability in the amplitude of the Solar wind on both short and long time scales. In this study, we test and validate a new, cutting-edge Solar wind modeling method included in the \texttt{enterprise} software suite through extended simulations, and we apply it to investigate temporal variability in LOFAR data. Our model testing scheme in itself provides an invaluable asset for pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. As improperly accounting for the solar wind signature in pulsar data can induce false-positive signals, it is of fundamental importance to include in any such investigations. We employ a Bayesian approach utilizing a continuously varying Gaussian process to model the solar wind referred to as Solar Wind Gaussian Process (SWGP). We conduct noise analysis on eight pulsars from the LOFAR dataset with most pulsars having a timespan of $\sim 11$ years encompassing one full solar activity cycle. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the electron density at 1 AU and the ecliptic latitude (ELAT) of the pulsar. Pulsars with $|ELAT|&lt; 3^{\circ}$ exhibit significantly higher average electron densities. We observe distinct temporal patterns in electron densities in different pulsars. In particular, pulsars within $|ELAT|&lt; 3^{\circ}$ exhibit similar temporal variations, while the electron densities of those outside this range correlate with the solar activity cycle. The continuous variability in electron density offered in this model represents a substantial improvement over previous models, which assume a single value for piece-wise bins of time. This advancement holds promise for solar wind modeling in future International Pulsar Timing Array data combinations.</description>

      <title>TV Mon - post mass transfer Algol type binary with $\delta$ Scuti pulsations in primary component</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the detached eclipsing binary TV~Mon using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey and ASAS-SN, CoRoT photometry. We applied multiple-epochs spectral fitting to derive RV and spectral parameters. The analysis of eclipses in CoRoT data told us relative sizes of the stellar components and almost edge-on circular orbit. Combining spectral and photometrical solution we estimated masses and radii of the components: $M_{A,B}=2.063\pm0.033,~0.218\pm0.004~M_\odot$, $R_{A,B}=2.427\pm0.014,~2.901\pm0.016~R_\odot$. SED analysis and Gaia parallax allowed us to get estimation of temperatures $T_{A,B}=7624^{+194}_{-174},~5184^{+130}_{-123}$ K and distance $d=907\pm11$ pc. We identified three $\delta$ Scuti type pulsation frequencies in primary component, while we also suspect TV~Mon having a long period variability with period $P_{\rm long}\sim128$ days and spot activity in secondary component. This system experienced intensive mass transfer and mass ratio reversal in the past, currently showing no signs of mass transfer in the spectra. The low mass component will lose its outer envelope and shrink to the helium white dwarf, which mass and orbital period are in good agreement with evolutionary models predictions.</description>

Abstract: Lunar reference systems represent a fundamental aspect of lunar exploration. This paper presents a review of the topic in the context of the ESA lunar programme, MoonLight. This paper describes the current state of the art in the definition of the lunar reference frame and introduces TCL, a lunar time scale based on IAU resolutions. It also proposes several possible implementations of this time scale for orbiting and ground-based clocks. Finally, it provides an assessment of the improvement of the lunar reference frame that would result from the addition of lunar retro-reflectors on the Moon surface and the use of orbiter altimetry. This document is an appendix dedicated to lunar reference system definition of a more global document dedicated to the presentation of new concepts in orbit determination and time synchronization of a lunar radio navigation system.</description>

Abstract: Within the RoadMap project we investigated the microphysical aspects of particle collisions during saltation on the Martian surface in laboratory experiments. Following the size distribution of ejected particles, their aerodynamic properties and aggregation status upon ejection, we now focus on the electrification and charge distribution of ejected particles. We analyzed rebound and ejection trajectories of grains in a vacuum setup with a strong electric field of 100 kV/m and deduced particle charges from their acceleration. The ejected particles have sizes of about 10 to 100 microns. They carry charges up to $10^5$ e or charge densities up to $&gt; 10^7$ e/mm$^2$. Within the given size range, we find a small bias towards positive charges.</description>

      <title>Identifying activity induced RV periodicities and correlations using Central Line Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radial velocity (RV) method of exoplanet detection requires mitigation of nuisance signals arising from stellar activity. Using analytic cool and facular spot models, we explore the use of central line moments (CLMs) for recovering and monitoring rotation induced RV variability. Different spot distribution patterns, photosphere-spot contrast ratios and the presence or absence of the convective blueshift lead to differences in CLM signals between M dwarfs and G dwarfs. Harmonics of the rotation period are often recovered with the highest power in standard periodogram analyses. By contrast, we show the true stellar rotation may be more reliably recovered with string length minimisation. For solar minimum activity levels, recovery of the stellar rotation signal from CLMs is found to require unfeasibly high signal-to-noise observations. The stellar rotation period can be recovered at solar maximum activity levels from CLMs for reasonable cross-correlation function (CCF) signal-to-noise ratios $&gt; 1000 - 5000$. The CLMs can be used to recover and monitor stellar activity through their mutual correlations and correlations with RV and bisector inverse span. The skewness of a CCF, a measure of asymmetry, is described by the third CLM, $M_3$. Our noise-free simulations indicate the linear RV vs $M_3$ correlation is up to 10 per cent higher than the RV vs bisector inverse span correlation. We find a corresponding $\sim 5$ per cent increase in linear correlation for CARMENES observations of the M star, AU Mic. We also assess the effectiveness of the time derivative of the second CLM, $M_2$, for monitoring stellar activity.</description>

      <title>The CRAFT Coherent (CRACO) upgrade I: System Description and Results of the 110-ms Radio Transient Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results from a new backend on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Commensal Realtime ASKAP Fast Transient COherent (CRACO) upgrade. CRACO records millisecond time resolution visibility data, and searches for dispersed fast transient signals including fast radio bursts (FRB), pulsars, and ultra-long period objects (ULPO). With the visibility data, CRACO can localise the transient events to arcsecond-level precision after the detection. Here, we describe the CRACO system and report the result from a sky survey carried out by CRACO at 110ms resolution during its commissioning phase. During the survey, CRACO detected two FRBs (including one discovered solely with CRACO, FRB 20231027A), reported more precise localisations for four pulsars, discovered two new RRATs, and detected one known ULPO, GPM J1839-10, through its sub-pulse structure. We present a sensitivity calibration of CRACO, finding that it achieves the expected sensitivity of 11.6 Jy ms to bursts of 110 ms duration or less. CRACO is currently running at a 13.8 ms time resolution and aims at a 1.7 ms time resolution before the end of 2024. The planned CRACO has an expected sensitivity of 1.5 Jy ms to bursts of 1.7 ms duration or less, and can detect 10x more FRBs than the current CRAFT incoherent sum system (i.e., 0.5-2 localised FRBs per day), enabling us to better constrain the FRB emission mechanism model and use them as cosmological probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the numerical relativity module within AthenaK, an open source performance-portable astrophysics code designed for exascale computing applications. This module employs the Z4c formulation to solve the Einstein equations. We demonstrate its accuracy through a series of standard numerical relativity tests, including convergence of the gravitational waveform from binary black hole coalescence. Furthermore, we conduct scaling tests on OLCF Frontier and NERSC Perlmutter, where AthenaK exhibits excellent weak scaling efficiency of 80% on up to 65,536 AMD MI250X GPUs on Frontier (relative to 4 GPUs) and strong scaling efficiencies of 84% and 77% on AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs on Frontier and Perlmutter respectively. Additionally, we observe a significant performance boost, with two orders of magnitude speedup ($\gtrsim 200\times$) on a GPU compared to a single CPU core, affirming that AthenaK is well-suited for exascale computing, thereby expanding the potential for breakthroughs in numerical relativity research.</description>

Abstract: In this work we employ the methods of archaeoastronomy to analyze the orientation, possibly astronomical, of numerous groups of chullpa funerary towers, mainly from the 12th to 16th centuries, located in the Lauca River valley of the central Bolivian highlands. Despite their great historical relevance, both regarding the beliefs and funerary customs of the local populations and the characteristics of the landscape in the highlands, little is known about the relationship of these mortuary monuments with the sky. Several authors, from chroniclers of the colonial era to more modern explorers, indicate that the tomb towers of these regions are oriented in such a way that important parts of their structure (in general, the entrances of the chullpas) point towards the sunrise on the eastern horizon, in order to be imbued with the first rays of the Sun. However, the sunrise changes its location noticeably at different times of the year. Given the lack of written information or other forms of original documentation, in order to affirm the use of a systematic orientation, it is necessary to measure a statistically significant number of monuments. We present here the results of the analysis of the precise spatial orientation of the entrances of 80 towers measured in situ during field work in the Lauca River valley. We find that, except for a few, all the buildings have the openings' axes oriented towards the east and within the solar range, between the extreme azimuths of the annual movement of the Sun as it crosses the local horizon, with a notable concentration of entrances that point slightly towards the north of due east. Our work is the first systematic study of the orientations of the chullpa towers of the Lauca River and can provide crucial information to understand the evolution and scope of the chullpa phenomenon in the Bolivian highlands and in the entire surrounding region.</description>

Abstract: Photonic lanterns are waveguide devices enabling high throughput single mode spectroscopy and high angular resolution. We aim to present the first on-sky demonstration of a photonic lantern (PL) operating in visible light, to measure its throughput and assess its potential for high-resolution spectroscopy of compact objects. We used the SCExAO instrument (a double stage extreme AO system installed at the Subaru telescope) and FIRST mid-resolution spectrograph (R 3000) to test the visible capabilities of the PL on internal source and on-sky observations. The best averaged coupling efficiency over the PL field of view was measured at 51% +/- 10% with a peak at 80%. We also investigate the relationship between coupling efficiency and the Strehl ratio for a PL, comparing them with those of a single-mode fiber (SMF). Findings show that in the AO regime, a PL offers better coupling efficiency performance than a SMF, especially in the presence of low spatial frequency aberrations. We observed Ikiiki (alpha Leo - mR = 1.37) and `Aua (alpha Ori - mR = -1.17) at a frame rate of 200 Hz. Under median seeing conditions (about 1 arcsec measured in H band) and large tip/tilt residuals (over 20 mas), we estimated an average light coupling efficiency of 14.5% +/- 7.4%, with a maximum of 42.8% at 680 nm. We were able to reconstruct both star's spectra, containing various absorption lines. The successful demonstration of this device opens new possibilities in terms of high throughput single-mode fiber-fed spectroscopy in the Visible. The demonstrated on-sky coupling efficiency performance would not have been achievable with a single SMF injection setup under similar conditions, partly because the residual tip/tilt alone exceeded the field of view of a visible SMF (18 mas at 700 nm). Thus emphasizing the enhanced resilience of PL technology to such atmospheric disturbances. The additional</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Extraction Against Non-Stationary Instrumental Noises with Deep Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Sapce-borne gravitational wave antennas, such as LISA and LISA-like mission (Taiji and Tianqin), will offer novel perspectives for exploring our Universe while introduce new challenges, especially in data analysis. Aside from the known challenges like high parameter space dimension, superposition of large number of signals etc., gravitational wave detections in space would be more seriously affected by anomalies or non-stationarities in the science measurements. Considering the three types of foreseeable non-stationarities including data gaps, transients (glitches), and time-varying noise auto-correlations, which may come from routine maintenance or unexpected disturbances during science operations, we developed a deep learning model for accurate signal extractions confronted with such anomalous scenarios. Our model exhibits the same performance as the current state-of-the-art models do for the ideal and anomaly free scenario, while shows remarkable adaptability in extractions of coalescing massive black hole binary signal against all three types of non-stationarities and even their mixtures. This also provide new explorations into the robustness studies of deep learning models for data processing in space-borne gravitational wave missions.</description>

      <title>A likelihood framework for cryogenic scintillating calorimeters used in the CRESST dark matter search</title>

Abstract: Cryogenic scintillating calorimeters are ultrasensitive particle detectors for rare event searches, particularly for the search for dark matter and the measurement of neutrino properties. These detectors are made from scintillating target crystals generating two signals for each particle interaction. The phonon (heat) signal precisely measures the deposited energy independent of the type of interacting particle. The scintillation light signal yields particle discrimination on an event-by-event basis. This paper presents a likelihood framework modeling backgrounds and a potential dark matter signal in the two-dimensional plane spanned by phonon and scintillation light energies. We apply the framework to data from CaWO$_4$-based detectors operated in the CRESST dark matter search. For the first time, a single likelihood framework is used in CRESST to model the data and extract results on dark matter in one step by using a profile likelihood ratio test. Our framework simultaneously fits (neutron) calibration data and physics (background) data and allows combining data from multiple detectors. Although tailored to CaWO$_4$-targets and the CRESST experiment, the framework can easily be expanded to other materials and experiments using scintillating cryogenic calorimeters for dark matter search and neutrino physics.</description>
