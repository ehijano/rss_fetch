      <title>The core in the housing market model with fractional endowments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the core concept in a generalization of the housing market model where agents own fractional endowments while maintaining ordinal preferences. Recognizing that individuals are easier than coalitions to block an allocation, we adopt a definition in which individuals block an allocation if their received assignments do not first-order stochastically dominate their endowment, while a non-singleton coalition blocks an allocation if they can reallocate their endowments to obtain new assignments that first-order stochastically dominate their original assignments. Our findings show that, unlike the original model, the strong core may be empty, while the weak core is nonempty. The weak core always contains elements that satisfy equal treatment of equals, but it may not contain elements satisfying equal-endowment no envy.</description>

      <title>Efficient and fair trading mechanisms for resource exchange in market design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.06878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method using parameterized linear equations to define trading mechanisms in market design models. Our method adeptly addresses challenges arising from factors such as complex endowments or coarse priorities, while offering flexibility to incorporate fairness concerns through the selection of equation parameters. Applying this method to models including fractional endowment exchange, priority-based allocation, and house allocation with existing tenants, we obtain new mechanisms that are both efficient and fair in these models.</description>

      <title>Efficient and fair trading mechanisms on the full preference domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.09340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yu and Zhang (2025) introduce a new method for defining trading mechanisms in market design and apply it to develop new mechanisms that achieve efficiency and fairness in various models. However, their assumption of strict preferences limits its applicability. This paper extends their approach to the full preference domain, allowing for indifferences while preserving key efficiency and fairness properties. As a corollary, we generalize the probabilistic serial mechanism in the house allocation model to the full preference domain without relying on operations research tools.</description>

      <title>LQG Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses information design in a workhorse model of network games, where agents have linear best responses, the information designer maximizes a quadratic objective, and the payoff-relevant state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and establish strong duality to characterize the optimal information structure. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is given by a simple linear relationship between the induced equilibrium strategy profile and the state. Leveraging this characterization, we show that the state is fully revealed in an aggregative form for welfare maximization, while individual agents may remain only partially informed. When agent roles are interchangeable, the optimal information structure inherits the same degree of symmetry, which facilitates computation. In such cases, we show that the optimal amount of information revealed to each agent is closely linked to the network's chromatic number.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Matching Framework for Faster Child Adoptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Caseworkers in foster care systems match waiting children to adoptive homes. We use dynamic matching market design to characterize a class of mechanisms that incentivize expedient matches that homes can accept or decline. We design mechanisms satisfying fairness and limited strategy-proofness. They also avoid costly patience. Our empirically-based simulations suggest the mechanisms could increase adoptions by at least 25% versus the status quo. A naive dynamic extension of Deferred Acceptance does not attain these benefits. Our mechanisms sidestep direct preference elicitation by predicting preferences, and they are robust to prediction error.</description>

      <title>Making school choice lotteries transparent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lotteries are commonly employed in school choice to fairly resolve priority ties; however, current practices typically keep students uninformed about their lottery outcomes at the time of preference submission. This paper advocates for revealing lottery information to students beforehand. When preference lists are constrained in length, which is a common feature in real-world systems, such disclosure reduces uncertainty and enables students to make more informed decisions. We demonstrate the benefits of lottery revelation through two stylized models. Theoretical predictions are supported by laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Verifiable affirmative action in school admissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When implementing affirmative action through reserve systems, to maintain social trust and demonstrate the absence of corruption, countries such as Brazil, China, and India aim for verifiable allocations of reserve quotas, allowing students to confirm their assignments using private information and publicly disclosed data such as school admission cutoffs. Motivated by this, we study verifiable mechanisms in the controlled school choice model. We first show that sequential mechanisms, which allocate reserved and open seats in separate stages, offer intuitive verifiability but suffer from strategic complexity and inefficiency. We then formalize verifiability for simultaneous mechanisms, which allocate all seats in a single stage. We prove that a mechanism is individually rational, strategy-proof, and verifiable if and only if it is a deferred acceptance mechanism using one of two choice rules we characterize. We recommend a specific rule and mechanism and discuss their practical relevance to China's high school admissions.</description>
