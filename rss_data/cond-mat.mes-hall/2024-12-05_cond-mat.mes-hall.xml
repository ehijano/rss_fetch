      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall crystals in moir\'e bands with higher Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e materials has sparked the search for further novel phases of matter in this platform. In particular, recent works have demonstrated the possibility of realizing quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHCs), which combine the zero-field quantum Hall effect with spontaneously broken translation symmetry. Here, we employ exact diagonalization to demonstrate the existence of stable QAHCs arising from $\frac{2}{3}$-filled moir\'e bands with Chern number $C=2$. Our calculations show that these topological crystals, which are characterized by a quantized Hall conductivity of $1$ and a tripled unit cell, are robust in an ideal model of twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene -- providing a novel explanation for experimental observations in this heterostructure. Furthermore, we predict that the QAHC remains robust in a realistic model of twisted double bilayer graphene and, in addition, we provide a range of optimal tuning parameters, namely twist angle and electric field, for experimentally realizing this phase. Overall, our work demonstrates the stability of QAHCs at odd-denominator filling of $C=2$ bands, provides specific guidelines for future experiments, and establishes chiral multilayer graphene as a theoretical platform for studying topological phases beyond the Landau level paradigm.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch Dirac Points and Phase Diagram in the Stacked Non-Hermitian SSH Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals exhibit protected band crossings in momentum space, accompanied by corresponding surface states. Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians introduce geometry-sensitive features that dissolve this bulk-boundary correspondence principle. In this paper, we exemplify this phenomenon by investigating a non-Hermitian 2D stacked SSH chain model with non-reciprocal hopping and on-site gain/loss. We derive an analytical phase diagram in terms of the complex energy gaps in the open-boundary spectrum. The phase diagram reveals the existence of non-Bloch Dirac points, which feature a real spectrum and only appear under open boundary conditions but disappear in Bloch bands under periodic boundary conditions. Due to the reality of the spectrum in the vicinity of non-Bloch Dirac points, we can locally map it to Hermitian semimetals within the Altland-Zirnabuer symmetry classes. Based on this mapping, we demonstrate that non-Bloch Dirac points are characterized by an integer topological charge. Unlike the band crossings in Hermitian semimetals, the locations of the non-Bloch Dirac points under different boundary geometries do not match each other, indicating a geometry-dependent bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian semimetals. Our findings provide new pathways into establishing unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence for non-Bloch Dirac metals in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Damping Enhancement in YIG at Millikelvin Temperatures due to GGG Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics aims to exploit the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), which offers the longest magnon lifetimes, is a key material typically grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates for structural compatibility. However, the increased magnetic damping in YIG/GGG systems below 50$\,$K poses a challenge for quantum applications. Here, we study the damping in a 97$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick GGG substrate at temperatures down to 30$\,$mK using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. We show that the dominant physical mechanism for the observed tenfold increase in FMR linewidth at millikelvin temperatures is the non-uniform bias magnetic field generated by the partially magnetized paramagnetic GGG substrate. Numerical simulations and analytical theory show that the GGG-driven linewidth enhancement can reach up to 6.7 times. In addition, at low temperatures and frequencies above 18$\,$GHz, the FMR linewidth deviates from the viscous Gilbert-damping model. These results allow the partial elimination of the damping mechanisms attributed to GGG, which is necessary for the advancement of solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Robust Edge States from Band Topology in a Damped One-dimensional Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence or absence of topologically-produced edge states of a crystal are robust to disorder; their stability in the presence of decay is less clear. For topologically nontrivial bosonic systems with finite particle lifetimes, such as photonic, phononic, or magnonic structures, a natural hypothesis suggests that if the linewidth from particle decay exceeds the gap between neighboring bands, then topological features such as Berry phases or edge states will lose their protection. Here we show that topological properties are significantly more robust than this, by assessing the properties of a one-dimensional magnonic crystal as the damping is increased. Even when the damping greatly exceeds the gap between neighboring bands the Zak phase of those bands is nearly unchanged, and the edge states remain clearly visible in micromagnetic simulations of microwave transmission. These results clarify the understanding of robust topological properties and bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Orbital anomalous Hall effect in the few-layer Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of the linear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the nonmagnetic Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. This is achieved by applying a direct current Idc and an alternating current Iac (Iac&lt;&lt;Idc) in TaIrTe4, where the former induces time-reversal symmetry breaking and the latter probes the triggered AHE. The anomalous Hall resistance VacH/Iac shows a linear dependence on Idc and changes sign with the polarity of Idc. In temperature-dependent measurements, VacH/Iac also experiences a sign reversal at 100 K, consistent with the temperature-dependent nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). Furthermore, in measurements involving only dc transport, the dc Hall voltage exhibits a quadratic relationship with Idc. When the Idc direction is reversed, the Hall resistance changes sign, demonstrating a colossal nonreciprocal Hall effect (NRHE). Our theoretical calculations suggest that the observed linear AHE, NLHE, and NRHE all dominantly originate from the current-induced orbital magnetization compared to the minor spin contribution. This work provides deep insights into the orbital magnetoelectric effect and nonlinear Hall response, promising precise electric control of out-of-plane polarized orbit flow.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin and orbital Edelstein effect in WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials with spin-momentum locked spin textures, such as Rashba states and topological surface states, the current-induced shift of the Fermi contour in the k space leads to spin polarization, known as the Edelstein effect, which depends linearly on the applied current. However, its nonlinear counterpart has not yet been discovered. Here, we report the observation of the nonlinear Edelstein effect in few-layer WTe2. Under a current bias, an out-of-plane magnetization is induced in WTe2, which is electrically probed using an Fe3GeTe2 electrode, a van der Waals ferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Notably, with an applied ac at frequency {\omega}, an induced magnetization with second-harmonic response at frequency 2{\omega} is observed, and its magnitude demonstrates a quadratic dependence on the applied current, characteristic of the nonlinear Edelstein effect. This phenomenon is well explained by the current-induced orbital magnetization via the Berry connection polarizability tensors in WTe2. The orbital degree of freedom plays the primary role in the observed nonlinear Edelstein effect, that is, the nonlinear orbital Edelstein effect. This can, in turn, give rise to a nonlinear spin Edelstein effect through spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Valley and Spin Valves in Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear transport plays a vital role in probing the quantum geometry of Bloch electrons, valley chirality, and carrier scattering mechanisms. The nonlinear Hall effect, characterized by a nonlinear scaling of Hall voltage with longitudinal current, has been explored to reveal the Berry curvature and quantum metric related physics. In this work, we extend the study of nonlinear transport to spin and valley degrees of freedom. Using bilayer graphene devices with Fe3GeTe2 contacts, we observe a second-order nonlinear spin current exhibiting spin valve-like behaviors. By tracking magnetic moment precession under an in-plane magnetic field, we identify a significantly enhanced critical magnetic field required for in-plane rotation, suggesting out-of-plane valley polarization induced by ferromagnetic proximity. These findings offer deep insights into the interplay of valley and spin in second-order nonlinear transport, opening avenues for promising device applications.</description>

      <title>Quantized Landau-level crossing checkerboard in large-angle twisted graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When charge transport occurs under conditions like topological protection or ballistic motion, the conductance of low-dimensional systems often exhibits quantized values in units of $e^{2}/h$, where $e$ and $h$ are the elementary charge and Planck's constant. Such quantization has been pivotal in quantum metrology and computing. Here, we demonstrate a novel quantized quantity: the ratio of the displacement field to the magnetic field, $D/B$, in large-twist-angle bilayer graphene. In the high magnetic field limit, Landau level crossings between the top and bottom layers manifest equal-sized checkerboard patterns throughout the $D/B$-$\nu$ space. It stems from a peculiar electric-field-driven interlayer charge transfer at one elementary charge per flux quantum, leading to quantized intervals of critical displacement fields, (i.e., $\delta D$ = $\frac{e}{2\pi l_{B}^{2}}$, where $l_B$ is the magnetic length). Our findings suggest that interlayer charge transfer in the quantum Hall regime can yield intriguing physical phenomena, which has been overlooked in the past.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles in response to electromagnetic fields give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response characterized by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength "squeezing", and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, semiconducting materials are dominated by interband collective excitations, giving rise to exciton-polaritons with completely different properties, characterized by a superposition of the photon and exciton. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and follow a universal dispersion law for surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses that would enable their observation in cryo-SNOM experiments. Furthermore, we show that by electrically tuning the excitons' energy we can enable and control their hybridization with hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons supported by the surrounding hBN, which is fully described by an electromagnetic transmission line model. These predictions of plasmons-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable plasmonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pb on Si(111)-(7x7) shows surprising nucleation and mass transport dynamics at odds with standard theories. To create local imbalances on stable Pb islands we use the tip of a scanning force microscope. We enforce a short, local contact between the island and our tip. The subsequent island height growth and the local contact potential difference are studied via scanning force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Though the island has a large volume increase after the contact, we observe that its surrounding wetting layer shows the same Pb density decrease as the global wetting layer. This indicates a collective density thinning of the wetting layer.</description>

      <title>A Lower-Dimensional Remnant of Flux Attachment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux attachment is a mechanism allowing electric charges to capture magnetic flux in two spatial dimensions. Fundamentally, this is a consequence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect or, in field-theoretic language, of a Chern-Simons term. This is also intimately related to a transmutation of the exchange statistics of the original charges. We show that a remnant of this mechanism is found after a dimensional reduction of a pure Chern-Simons theory and its subsequent coupling to matter.</description>

      <title>A first-principles study on the physical properties of two-dimensional Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent advance, Nb3Cl8 two-dimensional crystals with a kagome lattice and electronic topological flat bands has been experimentally fabricated (Nano Lett. 2022, 22, 4596). In this work motivated by the aforementioned progress, we conduct first-principles calculations to explore the structural, phonon dispersion relations, single-layer exfoliation energies and mechanical features of the Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I) nanosheets. Acquired phonon dispersion relations reveal the dynamical stability of the Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I) monolayers. In order to isolate single-layer crystals from bulk counterparts, we predicted exfoliation energies of 0.24, 0.27 and 0.28 J/m2, for the Nb3Cl8, Nb3Br8 and Nb3I8 monolayers, respectively, which are noticeably lower than that of the graphene. We found that the Nb3X8 monolayers are relatively strong nanosheets with isotropic elasticity and anisotropic tensile strength. It is moreover shown that by increasing the atomic weight of halogen atoms in the Nb3X8 nanosheets, mechanical characteristics decline. Presented results provide a useful vision about the key physical properties of novel 2D systems of Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I).</description>

      <title>Berry Phase Dynamics of Sliding Electron Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems such as Wigner crystals and incommensurate charge density waves that spontaneously break a continuous translation symmetry have unusual transport properties arising from their ability to slide coherently in space. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that spontaneous translation symmetry breaking in some two-dimensional materials with nontrivial quantum geometry (e.g., rhombohedral pentalayer graphene) leads to a topologically nontrivial electron crystal state called the anomalous Hall crystal and characterized by a vanishing linear-response dc longitudinal conductivity and a non-vanishing Hall conductivity. In this work we present a theoretical investigation of the sliding dynamics of this new type of electron crystal, taking into account the system's nontrivial quantum geometry. We find that when accelerated by an external electric field, the crystal acquires a transverse anomalous velocity that stems from not only the Berry curvature of the parent band but also the Galilean non-invariance of the crystal state (i.e., crystal states with different momenta are not related by simple momentum boosts). We further show that acceleration of the crystal modifies its internal current from the static crystal value that is determined by the Chern number of the crystal state. The net Hall conductance including contributions from center-of-mass motion and internal current is in general not quantized. As an experimentally relevant example, we present numerical results in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and discuss possible experimental implications.</description>

Abstract: The topological properties of Bloch bands are intimately tied to the structure of their electronic wavefunctions within the unit cell of a crystal. Here, we show that scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on the prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor WSe$_2$ can be used to unambiguously fix the location of the Wannier center of the valence band. Using site-specific substitutional doping, we first determine the position of the atomic sites within STM images, establishing that the maximum electronic density of states at the $K$-point lies between the atoms. In contrast, the maximum density of states at the $\Gamma$ point is at the atomic sites. This signifies that WSe$_2$ is a topologically obstructed atomic insulator, which cannot be adiabatically transformed to the trivial atomic insulator limit.</description>

      <title>Fast and stable tight-binding framework for nonlocal kinetic energy density functional reconstruction in orbital-free density functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs) with density-dependent kernels are currently the most accurate functionals available for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) calculations. However, despite advances in numerical techniques and using only (semi)local density-dependent kernels, nonlocal KEDFs still present substantial computational costs in OF-DFT, limiting their application in large-scale material simulations. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient framework for reconstructing nonlocal KEDFs by incorporating the density functional tight-binding approach, in which the energy functionals are simplified through a first-order functional expansion based on the superposition of free-atom electron densities. This strategy allows the computationally expensive nonlocal kinetic energy and potential calculations to be performed only once during the electron density optimization process, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Benchmark tests using advanced nonlocal KEDFs, such as revHC and LDAK-MGPA, on standard structures including Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Si, III-V semiconductors, as well as Mg$_{50}$ and Si$_{50}$ clusters, demonstrate that our method achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency, providing a cost-effective balance between accuracy and computational speed. Additionally, the reconstructed functionals exhibit improved numerical stability for both bulk and finite systems, paving the way for developing more sophisticated KEDFs for realistic material simulations using OF-DFT.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spin Transfer in WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructure Enabled by Direct Interlayer p-Orbital Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated efficient spin transfer across layers in the van der Waals heterostructure composed of WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, signaling a potential breakthrough in developing all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices. However, the reasons behind the unusually high interlayer spin transparency observed, despite the weak van der Waals interactions between layers, remain unclear. In this study, we employ density functional theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function method to explore this phenomenon. We find that the efficient cross-layer spin transfer arises from direct hybridization of p-orbitals between tellurium atoms at the interface. This interlayer orbital hybridization lowers the electronic potential barrier and significantly modifies the spin-polarized electronic structure of Fe3GeTe2. Consequently, an effective channel for spin-polarized transport is established between WTe2 and Fe3GeTe2, leading to high interlayer spin transparency. Combining this enhanced spin transparency with the large spin Hall angle of WTe2 explains the high spin-orbit torque efficiency observed experimentally. Furthermore, we predict that applying a gate voltage can further increase this efficiency. Our findings offer a pathway for designing high-performance, all-van der Waals spin-orbit torque devices.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization driven by molecular vibrations leads to enantioselectivity in chiral molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality pervades multiple scientific domains-physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy-and profoundly influences their foundational principles. Recently, the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon has captured significant attention in physical chemistry due to its potential applications and intriguing underlying physics. Despite its prominence, the microscopic mechanisms of CISS remain hotly debated, hindering practical applications and further theoretical advancements. Here we challenge the established view that attributes CISS-related phenomena to current-induced spin polarization and electron transport across interfaces. We propose that molecular vibrations in chiral molecules primarily drive spin polarization, thereby governing CISS. Employing an electrochemical cell paired with a precisely engineered magnetic multilayer, we demonstrate that the magnetic interactions akin to interlayer exchange coupling are crucial for CISS. Our theoretical study suggests that molecular vibrations facilitate chirality-dependent spin polarization, which plays a pivotal role in CISS-related phenomena such as magnetoresistance and enantiomer separation using ferromagnets. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift in the design and analysis of systems in various scientific fields, extending the role of spin dynamics from traditional areas such as solid-state physics to chemical reactions, molecular biology, and even drug discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a concept of a superconducting photodiode - a device that transforms the energy and `spin' of an external electromagnetic field into the rectified steady-state supercurrent and develop a microscopic theory describing its properties. For this, we consider a two-dimensional thin film cooled down below the temperature of superconducting transition with the injected dc supercurrent and exposed to an external electromagnetic field with a frequency smaller than the superconducting gap. As a result, we predict the emergence of a photoexcited quasiparticle current, and, as a consequence, oppositely oriented stationary flow of Cooper pairs. The strength and direction of this photoinduced supercurrent depend on (i) such material properties as the effective impurity scattering time and the nonequilibrium quasiparticles' energy relaxation time and (ii) such electromagnetic field properties as its frequency and polarization.</description>

      <title>Hundness in twisted bilayer graphene: correlated gaps and pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize gap-opening mechanisms in the topological heavy fermion (THF) model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), with and without electron-phonon coupling, using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with the numerical renormalization group (NRG) impurity solver. In the presence of symmetry breaking associated with valley-orbital ordering (time-reversal-symmetric or Kramers intervalley coherent, or valley polarized), spin anti-Hund and orbital-angular-momentum Hund couplings, induced by the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect, result in a robust pseudogap at filling $2 \lesssim |\nu| \lesssim 2.5$. We also find that Hundness enhances the pairing susceptibilities for $1.6 \lesssim |\nu| \lesssim 2.8$, which might be a precursor to the superconducting phases neighboring $|\nu| = 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability boundaries of the skyrmion lattice in non-centrosymmetric bulk ferromagnets with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in external magnetic field are discussed. We compare the classical energies of the spin configuration of the conical helix and skyrmion lattice within the framework of the stereographic projection approach. It is well known that at low temperatures the skyrmion lattice loses energetically to the conical helix in the entire range of fields, $0 &lt; H &lt; H_{c2}$, where $H_{c2}$ is the transition field to the polarized collinear phase, and $g\mu_B H_{c2} \ll T_c$. We show that taking into account the dipole interaction does not qualitatively change the situation. However, the possibility of fluctuations in the absolute value of the equilibrium local magnetization in the Ginzburg-Landau functional leads, with increasing temperature, $T$, to the skyrmion lattice becoming energetically more favorable than the conical helix in a certain range of fields. We show that it occurs already in the first order of small parameter, $\propto g\mu_B H_{c2}/|T-T_c|$, at the level of mean field theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties and growth kinetics of Co/Gd bilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) exhibit a range of intriguing magnetic phenomena, including all-optical switching of magnetization (AOS), fast current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM), and the potential to act as orbital-to-spin angular momentum converters. For spintronic applications involving these materials, the Curie temperature is a crucial factor in determining not only the threshold energy for AOS, but also the material's resistance to temperature rise during CIDWM. However, the relationship between the Curie temperature, the thicknesses of the individual layers, and the specifics of the growth process remains an open question. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the Curie temperature of one of the archetype synthetic ferrimagnets with PMA, the Pt/Co/Gd trilayer, grown by DC magnetron sputtering and characterized with MOKE and SQUID. We provide an interpretation of the experiments we designed to address these outstanding questions through modeling of the deposition process and the induced magnetization at the Co/Gd interface. Our findings demonstrate that the Curie temperature and, by extension, the conditions for PMA and magnetic compensation, of these ultrathin 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets are not only impacted by the interface quality, which can be influenced by the sputtering process, but also to a significant extent by finite-size effects in the 4f-material. This work offers new methods and understanding to predict and manipulate the critical temperature and magnetostatic properties of 3d-4f synthetic ferrimagnets for spintronic applications and magneto-photonic integration.</description>

Abstract: Titanium (Ti) is an adhesion and contact metal commonly used in nanoelectronics and two-dimensional (2D) materials research. However, when Ti is deposited on graphene (Gr), we obtain dramatically different film morphology depending on the experimental conditions. Through a combination of transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio density functional theory calculations, we show that the most critical parameters are the number of Gr layers, the nature of the Gr support, and the deposition temperature. Particularly distinctive is the island morphology and large defect density of Ti on monolayer Gr, compared to bilayer or thicker Gr. We propose that this results from structural and mechanical differences between monolayer and thicker Gr flakes, where monolayer Gr is more flexible, exhibits larger surface roughness and therefore lower Ti diffusivity, and is more easily damaged. Our results highlight the extreme sensitivity of Ti morphology on Gr to processing and substrate conditions, allowing us to propose design rules for controlling Ti-Gr interface properties and morphology and to discuss the implications for other technologically relevant metal deposition processes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host exotic topological states that go beyond the traditional bulk-boundary correspondence. Up to now, there is still a lack of experimentally measurable momentum-space topological characterization for the HOTPs, which is not conducive to revealing the essential properties of these topological states and also restricts their detection in quantum simulation systems. Here, we propose a concept of polarized topological charges to characterize chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space, which further facilitates a feasible experimental scheme to detect the HOTPs in $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system. Remarkably, our characterization theory not only shows that the second-order (third-order) topological phases are determined by a quarter (negative eighth) of the total polarized topological charges, but also reveals that the higher-order topological phase transitions are identified by the creation or annihilation of polarized topological charges. Particularly, these polarized topological charges can be measured by pseudospin structures of the systems. Due to theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness, this work shall advance the broad studies of the HOTPs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Majorana and Shiba states in a minimal Kitaev chain coupled to a superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) coupled through a superconductor constitute a minimal realisation of a Kitaev chain with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Such MZMs can be detected by e.g., tunneling conductance between each QD and normal leads [Dvir et al, Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. We here discuss how the seemingly trivial substitution of one of the normal leads by a superconducting (SC) one gives rise to a plethora of new effects. In particular, the coupling to the SC lead induces non-local Majorana effects upon variations of the QDs' energies. Furthermore, the lowest excitation of the chain is no longer determined by the bulk gap but rather by the energy of an emergent subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state coexisting with the MZMs. The YSR state hybridizes with the MZMs when the coupling between the SC and the QD is larger than the spin splitting, spoiling the Majorana properties, including the quantized conductance.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the physics of hole-conjugate Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) phases characterized by counter-propagating edge channels at filling factors above 1/2. We propose a minimal and intuitive model that successfully accounts for all experimentally observed features, introducing a paradigm shift in the understanding of hole-conjugate edge channel dynamics. Our model identifies inter-channel charge equilibration as the sole essential mechanism, eliminating the need to invoke charge modes or upstream neutral modes, as posited in prior theoretical frameworks. By incorporating fictitious reservoirs along the edge, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces key observations, including counterintuitive upstream effects previously misattributed to neutral modes. We provide predictions for electrical and thermal conductance as well as current noise for filling factors 2/3 and 3/5. Additionally, we address the case of non-dissipative reservoirs, which preserve conductance properties while exhibiting infinite thermal relaxation lengths</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From lattice-regularized models, devoid of any non-Hermitian (NH) skin effects, here we compute the electrical ($\sigma_{xy}$), thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$), and spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall, and the electrical ($G_{xx}$) and thermal ($G^{th}_{xx}$) longitudinal conductivities for appropriate NH planar topological insulators and superconductors related to all five non-trivial Altland-Zirbauer symmetry classes in their Hermitian limits. These models feature real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, only where the associated topological invariants remain quantized. In this regime, the NH quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators show quantized $\sigma_{xy}$ and $G_{xx}$, respectively, the NH $p+ip$ ($p \pm ip$) pairing shows half-quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ ($G^{th}_{xx}$), while the NH $d+id$ pairing shows quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ in the clean and weak disorder (due to random pointlike charge impurities) regimes. We compute these quantities in experimentally realizable suitable six-terminal setups using the Kwant software package. But, in the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses vanish and with the increasing non-Hermiticity in the system this generic phenomenon occurs at weaker disorder.</description>

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect holds promise as a disruptive innovation in condensed matter physics and metrology, as it gives access to Hall resistance quantization in terms of the von-Klitzing constant RK = h/e2 at zero external magnetic field. In this work, we study the accuracy of Hall resistance quantization in a device based on the magnetic topological insulator material (V,Bi,Sb)2Te3. We show that the relative deviation of the Hall resistance from RK at zero external magnetic field is (4.4 +/- 8.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero measurement current, and (8.6 +/- 6.7) nohm/ohm when extrapolated to zero longitudinal resistivity (each with combined standard uncertainty, k = 1), which sets a new benchmark for the quantization accuracy in topological matter. This precision and accuracy at the nohm/ohm level (or 10-9 of relative uncertainty) achieve the thresholds for relevant metrological applications and establish a zero external magnetic field quantum standard of resistance - an important step towards the integration of quantum-based voltage and resistance standards into a single universal quantum electrical reference.</description>

      <title>Boundary Flat Bands with Topological Spin Textures Protected by Sub-chiral Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Chiral symmetry plays an indispensable role in topological classifications as well as in the understanding of the origin of bulk or boundary flat bands. The conventional definition of chiral symmetry refers to the existence of a constant unitary matrix anticommuting with the Hamiltonian. As a constant unitary matrix has constant eigenvectors, boundary flat bands enforced by chiral symmetry, which share the same eigenvectors with the chiral symmetry operator, are dictated to carry fixed (pseudo)spin polarizations and be featureless in quantum geometry. In this work, we generalize the chiral symmetry and introduce a concept termed sub-chiral symmetry. Unlike the conventional chiral symmetry operator defined as constant matrix, the sub-chiral symmetry operator depends on partial components of the momentum vector, so as its eigenvectors. We show that topological gapped or gapless systems without chiral symmetry but with sub-chiral symmetry can support boundary flat bands, which exhibit topological spin textures and quantized Berry phases. We expect that such intriguing boundary flat bands could give rise to a variety of exotic physics in the presence of interactions or disorders.</description>

      <title>Unconventional quantum oscillations and evidence of nonparabolic electronic states in quasi-two-dimensional electron system at complex oxide interfaces</title>

Abstract: The simultaneous occurrence of electric-field controlled superconductivity and spin-orbit interaction makes two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) constructed from perovskite transition metal oxides promising candidates for the next generation of spintronics and quantum computing. It is, however, essential to understand the electronic bands thoroughly and verify the predicted electronic states experimentally in these 2DES to advance technological applications. Here, we present novel insights into the electronic states of the 2DES at oxide interfaces through comprehensive investigations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in two different systems: EuO/KTaO$_3$ (EuO/KTO) and LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO). To accurately resolve these oscillations, we conducted transport measurements in high magnetic fields up to 60 T and low temperatures down to 100 mK. For 2D confined electrons at both interfaces, we observed a progressive increase of oscillations frequency and cyclotron mass with the magnetic field. We interpret these intriguing findings by considering the existence of non-trivial electronic bands, for which the $E-k$ dispersion incorporates both linear and parabolic dispersion relations. In addition to providing experimental evidence for topological-like electronic states in KTO-2DES and STO-2DES, the unconventional oscillations presented in this study establish a new paradigm for quantum oscillations in 2DES based on perovskite transition metal oxides, where the oscillations frequency exhibits quadratic dependence on the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Strong hole-photon coupling in planar Ge for probing charge degree and strongly-correlated states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in planar germanium (Ge) heterostructures have emerged as front-runners for future hole-based quantum processors. Here, we present strong coupling between a hole charge qubit, defined in a double quantum dot (DQD) in planar Ge, and microwave photons in a high-impedance ($Z_\mathrm{r} = 1.3 ~\mathrm{k}\Omega$) resonator based on an array of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Our investigation reveals vacuum-Rabi splittings with coupling strengths up to $g_0/2\pi = 260 ~\mathrm{MHz}$, and a cooperativity of $C \sim 100$, dependent on DQD tuning. Furthermore, utilizing the frequency tunability of our resonator, we explore the quenched energy splitting associated with strong Coulomb correlation effects in Ge QDs. The observed enhanced coherence of the strongly correlated excited state signals the presence of distinct symmetries within related spin functions, serving as a precursor to the strong coupling between photons and spin-charge hybrid qubits in planar Ge. This work paves the way towards coherent quantum connections between remote hole qubits in planar Ge, required to scale up hole-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in $d$-Electron Kagome Systems: Chern Insulating States from Transverse Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional kagome systems with $d$-orbital electrons is studied within a multi-orbital tight-binding model. We concentrate on the case of isotropic Slater-Koster integrals which is realized in a recently discovered class of metal-organic frameworks TM$_3$C$_6$O$_6$ with transition metals (TM) in the beginning of the 3$d$ series. Furthermore, in the absence of exchange-type spin-orbit coupling, only isotropic Slater-Koster integrals give a perfect flatband in addition to the two dispersive bands hosting relativistic (Dirac) and quadratic band crossing points at high symmetry spots in the Brillouin zone. A quantized topological invariant requires a flux-creating spin-orbit coupling, giving Chern number (per spin sector) $C=1$ not only from the familiar Dirac points at the six corners of the Brillouin zone, but also from the quadratic band crossing point at the center $\Gamma$. In the case of isotropic Slater-Koster integrals the on-site spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is ineffective to create the QAHE and it is only the transfer or exchange-type SOC which can lead to a QAHE. Surprisingly, this QAHE comes from the nontrivial effective flux induced by the \textit{transverse} part of the spin-orbit coupling, exhibited by electrons in the $d$-orbital state with $m_l=0$ ($d_{z^2}$ orbital), in stark contrast to the more familiar form of QAHE due to the $d$-orbitals with $m_l \neq 0$, driven by the Ising part of spin-orbit coupling. The $C=1$ Chern plateau (per spin sector) due to Dirac point extends over a smaller region of Fermi energy than that due to quadratic band crossing. Our result hints at the promising potential of kagome $d$-electron systems as a platform for dissipationless electronics by virtue of its unique QAHE.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning both $v_{F}$ and $m$ to improve the TE properties of the NLSs. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observe that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. We also find that in all TE metrics, the type-I NLS surprisingly can surpass the type-II NLS, which seems counter-intuitive to the fact that within the two-band model, the type-I NLS contains a parabolic band while the type-II NLS possesses a higher-order, Mexican-hat band. Our study demonstrates that optimizing the curvature of energy bands by tuning $v_F$ can significantly improve the TE performance of NLSs. This approach could guide future efforts in exploring other semimetals as potential TE materials by manipulating their band structures.</description>

      <title>Tunable second harmonic generation in 2D materials: comparison of different strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical frequency conversion, where optical fields interact with a nonlinear medium to generate new frequencies, is a key phenomenon in modern photonic systems. However, a major challenge with these techniques lies in the difficulty of tuning the nonlinear electrical susceptibilities that drive such effects in a given material. As a result, dynamic control of optical nonlinearities has remained largely confined to research laboratories, limiting its practical use as a spectroscopic tool. In this work, we aim to advance the development of devices with tunable nonlinear responses by exploring two potential mechanisms for electrically manipulating second-order optical nonlinearity in two-dimensional materials. Specifically, we consider two configurations: in the first, the material does not inherently exhibit second-harmonic generation (SHG), but this response is induced by an external field; in the second, an external field induces doping in a material that already exhibits SHG, altering the intensity of the nonlinear signal. In this work, we have studied these two configurations using a real-time ab-initio approach under an out-of-plane external field and including the effects of doping-induced variations in the screened electron-electron interaction. We then discuss the limitations of current computational methods and compare our results with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Anomalous wave-packet transport on boundaries of Floquet topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional periodically driven (Floquet) system with zero winding number in the absence of time-reversal symmetry is usually considered topologically trivial. Here, we study the dynamics of a Gaussian wave packet placed at the boundary of a two-dimensional driven system with zero winding numbers but multiple valley-protected edge states that can be realized in a square Raman lattice, and investigate the unidirectionally propagating topological edge currents. By carefully tuning the initial parameters of the wave packet including its spin polarization as well as the initial time of the periodic driving, we control the population of different edge states, where the speed of the resulting propagation establishes a direct correspondence with the target dispersions across different gaps and valleys. Interestingly, we find that the edge states at different valleys in the $\pi$ gap can hybridize and form bowtie-shaped edge bands fully detached from the bulk. This phase, not only presents a favorable regime with narrower bulk bands, but also exhibits distinct edge dynamics where the majority of particles bounce back-and-forth confined to a boundary while a small portion can follow a chiral transport around the sample.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy lose their ability to propagate to long distances in disordered media when undergoing the Anderson localization transition. We use Green functions in an analytically solvable model to describe the vanishing of diffusion at this transition. We find that the low-energy asymptotics of the electron-hole correlation function undergoes a crossover with a disorder-dependent time scale separating the two regimes. This scale determines how long the propagating particle remains captured within a finite volume. It is critical and diverges at the localization transition. According to our analysis, the diffusionless phase consists of quantum bound states that cannot be described in the space of Bloch waves and with the diffusion equation. We identify the necessary amendments to the existing approaches to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the emergence of Anderson localization.</description>
