      <title>Evolving Interpretable Constitutions for Multi-Agent Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constitutional AI has focused on single-model alignment using fixed principles. However, multi-agent systems create novel alignment challenges through emergent social dynamics. We present Constitutional Evolution, a framework for automatically discovering behavioral norms in multi-agent LLM systems. Using a grid-world simulation with survival pressure, we study the tension between individual and collective welfare, quantified via a Societal Stability Score S in [0,1] that combines productivity, survival, and conflict metrics. Adversarial constitutions lead to societal collapse (S= 0), while vague prosocial principles ("be helpful, harmless, honest") produce inconsistent coordination (S = 0.249). Even constitutions designed by Claude 4.5 Opus with explicit knowledge of the objective achieve only moderate performance (S= 0.332). Using LLM-driven genetic programming with multi-island evolution, we evolve constitutions maximizing social welfare without explicit guidance toward cooperation. The evolved constitution C* achieves S = 0.556 +/- 0.008 (123% higher than human-designed baselines, N = 10), eliminates conflict, and discovers that minimizing communication (0.9% vs 62.2% social actions) outperforms verbose coordination. Our interpretable rules demonstrate that cooperative norms can be discovered rather than prescribed.</description>

      <title>Communications-Incentivized Collaborative Reasoning in NetGPT through Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of next-Generation (xG) wireless networks marks a paradigm shift from connectivity-centric architectures to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native designs that tightly integrate data, computing, and communication. Yet existing AI deployments in communication systems remain largely siloed, offering isolated optimizations without intrinsic adaptability, dynamic task delegation, or multi-agent collaboration. In this work, we propose a unified agentic NetGPT framework for AI-native xG networks, wherein a NetGPT core can either perform autonomous reasoning or delegate sub-tasks to domain-specialized agents via agentic communication. The framework establishes clear modular responsibilities and interoperable workflows, enabling scalable, distributed intelligence across the network. To support continual refinement of collaborative reasoning strategies, the framework is further enhanced through Agentic reinforcement learning under partially observable conditions and stochastic external states. The training pipeline incorporates masked loss against external agent uncertainty, entropy-guided exploration, and multi-objective rewards that jointly capture task quality, coordination efficiency, and resource constraints. Through this process, NetGPT learns when and how to collaborate, effectively balancing internal reasoning with agent invocation. Overall, this work provides a foundational architecture and training methodology for self-evolving, AI-native xG networks capable of autonomous sensing, reasoning, and action in complex communication environments.</description>

      <title>Symphony-Coord: Emergent Coordination in Decentralized Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent large language model systems can tackle complex multi-step tasks by decomposing work and coordinating specialized behaviors. However, current coordination mechanisms typically rely on statically assigned roles and centralized controllers. As agent pools and task distributions evolve, these design choices lead to inefficient routing, poor adaptability, and fragile fault recovery capabilities. We introduce Symphony-Coord, a decentralized multi-agent framework that transforms agent selection into an online multi-armed bandit problem, enabling roles to emerge organically through interaction. The framework employs a two-stage dynamic beacon protocol: (i) a lightweight candidate screening mechanism to limit communication and computational overhead; (ii) an adaptive LinUCB selector that routes subtasks based on context features derived from task requirements and agent states, continuously optimized through delayed end-to-end feedback. Under standard linear realizability assumptions, we provide sublinear regret bounds, indicating the system converges toward near-optimal allocation schemes. Validation through simulation experiments and real-world large language model benchmarks demonstrates that Symphony-Coord not only enhances task routing efficiency but also exhibits robust self-healing capabilities in scenarios involving distribution shifts and agent failures, achieving a scalable coordination mechanism without predefined roles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Teams Hold Experts Back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly deployed as autonomous collaborators, where agents interact freely rather than execute fixed, pre-specified workflows. In such settings, effective coordination cannot be fully designed in advance and must instead emerge through interaction. However, most prior work enforces coordination through fixed roles, workflows, or aggregation rules, leaving open the question of how well self-organizing teams perform when coordination is unconstrained. Drawing on organizational psychology, we study whether self-organizing LLM teams achieve strong synergy, where team performance matches or exceeds the best individual member. Across human-inspired and frontier ML benchmarks, we find that -- unlike human teams -- LLM teams consistently fail to match their expert agent's performance, even when explicitly told who the expert is, incurring performance losses of up to 37.6%. Decomposing this failure, we show that expert leveraging, rather than identification, is the primary bottleneck. Conversational analysis reveals a tendency toward integrative compromise -- averaging expert and non-expert views rather than appropriately weighting expertise -- which increases with team size and correlates negatively with performance. Interestingly, this consensus-seeking behavior improves robustness to adversarial agents, suggesting a trade-off between alignment and effective expertise utilization. Our findings reveal a significant gap in the ability of self-organizing multi-agent teams to harness the collective expertise of their members.</description>

      <title>A-MapReduce: Executing Wide Search via Agentic MapReduce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems exhibit systematic advantages in deep research tasks, which emphasize iterative, vertically structured information seeking. However, when confronted with wide search tasks characterized by large-scale, breadth-oriented retrieval, existing agentic frameworks, primarily designed around sequential, vertically structured reasoning, remain stuck in expansive search objectives and inefficient long-horizon execution. To bridge this gap, we propose A-MapReduce, a MapReduce paradigm-inspired multi-agent execution framework that recasts wide search as a horizontally structured retrieval problem. Concretely, A-MapReduce implements parallel processing of massive retrieval targets through task-adaptive decomposition and structured result aggregation. Meanwhile, it leverages experiential memory to drive the continual evolution of query-conditioned task allocation and recomposition, enabling progressive improvement in large-scale wide-search regimes. Extensive experiments on five agentic benchmarks demonstrate that A-MapReduce is (i) high-performing, achieving state-of-the-art performance on WideSearch and DeepWideSearch, and delivering 5.11% - 17.50% average Item F1 improvements compared with strong baselines with OpenAI o3 or Gemini 2.5 Pro backbones; (ii) cost-effective and efficient, delivering superior cost-performance trade-offs and reducing running time by 45.8\% compared to representative multi-agent baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/mingju-c/AMapReduce.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Decision-Feedback: Theory-Driven Adaptive Scaffolding for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent LLM architectures offer opportunities for pedagogical agents to help students construct domain knowledge and develop critical-thinking skills, yet many operate on a "one-size-fits-all" basis, limiting their ability to provide personalized support. To address this, we introduce Evidence-Decision-Feedback (EDF), a theoretical framework for adaptive scaffolding using LLMs. EDF integrates elements of intelligent tutoring systems and agentic behavior by organizing interactions around evidentiary inference, pedagogical decision-making, and adaptive feedback. We instantiate EDF through Copa, an agentic collaborative peer agent for STEM+C problem-solving. In an authentic high school classroom study, we show that EDF-aligned interactions align feedback with students' demonstrated understanding and task mastery; promote gradual scaffold fading; and support interpretable, evidence-grounded explanations without fostering overreliance.</description>

      <title>TABX: A High-Throughput Sandbox Battle Simulator for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of environments plays a critical role in shaping the development and evaluation of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While existing benchmarks highlight critical challenges, they often lack the modularity required to design custom evaluation scenarios. We introduce the Totally Accelerated Battle Simulator in JAX (TABX), a high-throughput sandbox designed for reconfigurable multi-agent tasks. TABX provides granular control over environmental parameters, permitting a systematic investigation into emergent agent behaviors and algorithmic trade-offs across a diverse spectrum of task complexities. Leveraging JAX for hardware-accelerated execution on GPUs, TABX enables massive parallelization and significantly reduces computational overhead. By providing a fast, extensible, and easily customized framework, TABX facilitates the study of MARL agents in complex structured domains and serves as a scalable foundation for future research. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TABX-00CA.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolving Coordination Protocol in Multi-Agent AI Systems: An Exploratory Systems Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems increasingly rely on internal coordination mechanisms to combine, arbitrate, or constrain the outputs of heterogeneous components. In safety-critical and regulated domains such as finance, these mechanisms must satisfy strict formal requirements, remain auditable, and operate within explicitly bounded limits. Coordination logic therefore functions as a governance layer rather than an optimization heuristic.
  This paper presents an exploratory systems feasibility study of Self-Evolving Coordination Protocols (SECP): coordination protocols that permit limited, externally validated self-modification while preserving fixed formal invariants. We study a controlled proof-of-concept setting in which six fixed Byzantine consensus protocol proposals are evaluated by six specialized decision modules. All coordination regimes operate under identical hard constraints, including Byzantine fault tolerance (f &lt; n/3), O(n2) message complexity, complete non-statistical safety and liveness arguments, and bounded explainability.
  Four coordination regimes are compared in a single-shot design: unanimous hard veto, weighted scalar aggregation, SECP v1.0 (an agent-designed non-scalar protocol), and SECP v2.0 (the result of one governed modification). Outcomes are evaluated using a single metric, proposal coverage, defined as the number of proposals accepted. A single recursive modification increased coverage from two to three accepted proposals while preserving all declared invariants.
  The study makes no claims regarding statistical significance, optimality, convergence, or learning. Its contribution is architectural: it demonstrates that bounded self-modification of coordination protocols is technically implementable, auditable, and analyzable under explicit formal constraints, establishing a foundation for governed multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>SafeTalkCoach: Diversity-Driven Multi-Agent Simulation for Parent-Teen Health Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of effective parent-child communication about sexual health is widely acknowledged, but real-world data on these conversations is scarce and challenging to collect, due to their private and sensitive nature. Although LLMs have been widely adopted in dialogue generation, they may deviate from best practices and frequently lack realism and diversity. We introduce SafeTalkCoach, a diversity-driven multi-agent dialogue generation framework that simulates parent-child conversations about sexual health, and present an accompanying dataset. SafeTalkCoach integrates crowd-sourced and synthesized scenarios, established sexual health guidelines, evidence-based personas, adaptive control modules, and hierarchical diversification. Through evaluations, we demonstrate that SafeTalkCoach generates diverse conversations while maintaining realism, communication quality, and controllability in practice. Our goal is that the SafeTalkCoach framework and the dataset support both AI research and health communications practices.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning for 5G Routing under Side Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks in the current 5G and beyond systems increasingly carry heterogeneous traffic with diverse quality-of-service constraints, making real-time routing decisions both complex and time-critical. A common approach, such as a heuristic with human intervention or training a single centralized RL policy or synchronizing updates across multiple learners, struggles with scalability and straggler effects. We address this by proposing an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) framework in which independent PPO agents, one per service, plan routes in parallel and commit resource deltas to a shared global resource environment. This coordination by state preserves feasibility across services and enables specialization for service-specific objectives. We evaluate the method on an O-RAN like network simulation using nearly real-time traffic data from the city of Montreal. We compared against a single-agent PPO baseline. AMARL achieves a similar Grade of Service (acceptance rate) (GoS) and end-to-end latency, with reduced training wall-clock time and improved robustness to demand shifts. These results suggest that asynchronous, service-specialized agents provide a scalable and practical approach to distributed routing, with applicability extending beyond the O-RAN domain.</description>

      <title>TessPay: Verify-then-Pay Infrastructure for Trusted Agentic Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global economy is entering the era of Agentic Commerce, where autonomous agents can discover services, negotiate prices, and transact value. However adoption towards agentic commerce faces a foundational trust gap: current systems are built for direct human interactions rather than agent-driven operations. It lacks core primitives across three critical stages of agentic transactions. First, Task Delegation lacks means to translate user intent into defined scopes, discover appropriate agents, and securely authorize actions. Second, Payment Settlement for tasks is processed before execution, lacking verifiable evidence to validate the agent's work. Third, Audit Mechanisms fail to capture the full transaction lifecycle, preventing clear accountability for disputes. While emerging standards address fragments of this trust gap, there still remains a critical need for a unified infrastructure that binds the entire transaction lifecycle.
  To resolve this gap, we introduce TessPay, a unified infrastructure that replaces implicit trust with a 'Verify-then-Pay' architecture. It is a two plane architecture separating control and verification from settlement. TessPay operationalizes trust across four distinct stages: Before execution, agents are anchored in a canonical registry and user intent is captured as verifiable mandates, enabling stakeholder accountability. During execution, funds are locked in escrow while the agent executes the task and generates cryptographic evidence (TLS Notary, TEE etc.) to support Proof of Task Execution (PoTE). At settlement, the system verifies this evidence and releases funds only when the PoTE satisfies verification predicates; modular rail adapters ensure this PoTE-gated escrow remains chain-agnostic across heterogeneous payment rails. After settlement, TessPay preserves a tamper-evident audit trail to enable clear accountability for dispute resolution.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional data processing pipelines are typically static and handcrafted for specific tasks, limiting their adaptability to evolving requirements. While general-purpose agents and coding assistants can generate code for well-understood data pipelines, they lack the ability to autonomously monitor, manage, and optimize an end-to-end pipeline once deployed. We present \textbf{Autonomous Data Processing using Meta-agents} (ADP-MA), a framework that dynamically constructs, executes, and iteratively refines data processing pipelines through hierarchical agent orchestration. At its core, \textit{meta-agents} analyze input data and task specifications to design a multi-phase plan, instantiate specialized \textit{ground-level agents}, and continuously evaluate pipeline performance. The architecture comprises three key components: a planning module for strategy generation, an orchestration layer for agent coordination and tool integration, and a monitoring loop for iterative evaluation and backtracking. Unlike conventional approaches, ADP-MA emphasizes context-aware optimization, adaptive workload partitioning, and progressive sampling for scalability. Additionally, the framework leverages a diverse set of external tools and can reuse previously designed agents, reducing redundancy and accelerating pipeline construction. We demonstrate ADP-MA through an interactive demo that showcases pipeline construction, execution monitoring, and adaptive refinement across representative data processing tasks.</description>

      <title>OpenGuanDan: A Large-Scale Imperfect Information Game Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of data-driven artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, heavily depends on large-scale benchmarks. Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain. The project is publicly available at https://github.com/GameAI-NJUPT/OpenGuanDan.</description>

Abstract: Modern AI agents increasingly combine conversational interaction with autonomous task execution, such as coding and web research, raising a natural question: what happens when an agent engaged in long-horizon tasks is subjected to user persuasion? We study how belief-level intervention can influence downstream task behavior, a phenomenon we name \emph{persuasion propagation}. We introduce a behavior-centered evaluation framework that distinguishes between persuasion applied during or prior to task execution. Across web research and coding tasks, we find that on-the-fly persuasion induces weak and inconsistent behavioral effects. In contrast, when the belief state is explicitly specified at task time, belief-prefilled agents conduct on average 26.9\% fewer searches and visit 16.9\% fewer unique sources than neutral-prefilled agents. These results suggest that persuasion, even in prior interaction, can affect the agent's behavior, motivating behavior-level evaluation in agentic systems.</description>

      <title>FinEvo: From Isolated Backtests to Ecological Market Games for Multi-Agent Financial Strategy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional financial strategy evaluation relies on isolated backtests in static environments. Such evaluations assess each policy independently, overlook correlations and interactions, and fail to explain why strategies ultimately persist or vanish in evolving markets. We shift to an ecological perspective, where trading strategies are modeled as adaptive agents that interact and learn within a shared market. Instead of proposing a new strategy, we present FinEvo, an ecological game formalism for studying the evolutionary dynamics of multi-agent financial strategies. At the individual level, heterogeneous ML-based traders-rule-based, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model (LLM) agents-adapt using signals such as historical prices and external news. At the population level, strategy distributions evolve through three designed mechanisms-selection, innovation, and environmental perturbation-capturing the dynamic forces of real markets. Together, these two layers of adaptation link evolutionary game theory with modern learning dynamics, providing a principled environment for studying strategic behavior. Experiments with external shocks and real-world news streams show that FinEvo is both stable for reproducibility and expressive in revealing context-dependent outcomes. Strategies may dominate, collapse, or form coalitions depending on their competitors-patterns invisible to static backtests. By reframing strategy evaluation as an ecological game formalism, FinEvo provides a unified, mechanism-level protocol for analyzing robustness, adaptation, and emergent dynamics in multi-agent financial markets, and may offer a means to explore the potential impact of macroeconomic policies and financial regulations on price evolution and equilibrium.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: A Co-Evolving Attacker-Defender Adversarial Game for Robust LLM Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing defenses often lag behind evolving adversarial attacks due to their \textbf{reliance on static, pre-collected data distributions}. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MAGIC}, a novel multi-turn multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates LLM safety alignment as an adversarial asymmetric game. Specifically, an attacker agent learns to iteratively rewrite original queries into deceptive prompts, while a defender agent simultaneously optimizes its policy to recognize and refuse such inputs. This dynamic process triggers a \textbf{co-evolution}, where the attacker's ever-changing strategies continuously uncover long-tail vulnerabilities, driving the defender to generalize to unseen attack patterns. Remarkably, we observe that the attacker, endowed with initial reasoning ability, evolves \textbf{novel, previously unseen combinatorial strategies} through iterative RL training, underscoring our method's substantial potential. Theoretically, we provide insights into a more robust game equilibrium and derive safety guarantees. Extensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior defense success rates without compromising the helpfulness of the model. Our code is available at https://github.com/BattleWen/MAGIC.</description>

      <title>From Perception to Action: Spatial AI Agents and World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>ROMA: Recursive Open Meta-Agent Framework for Long-Horizon Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current agentic frameworks underperform on long-horizon tasks. As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5. Our results demonstrate that recursive, modular agent architectures can scale reasoning depth while remaining interpretable, flexible, and model-agnostic.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-Agent Communication through Information Bottleneck and Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics applications face severe communication constraints that significantly impact coordination effectiveness. We present a framework that combines information bottleneck theory with vector quantization to enable selective, bandwidth-efficient communication in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to compress and discretize communication messages while preserving task-critical information through principled information-theoretic optimization. We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods. Our approach significantly outperforms existing communication strategies and establishes a theoretically grounded framework for deploying multi-agent systems in bandwidth-constrained environments such as robotic swarms, autonomous vehicle fleets, and distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Modelling Socio-Psychological Drivers of Land Management Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations. The approach can be integrated into other agent-based land use models and parameterised empirically in future work.</description>

      <title>Context Learning for Multi-Agent Discussion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Discussion (MAD) has garnered increasing attention very recently, where multiple LLM instances collaboratively solve problems via structured discussion. However, we find that current MAD methods easily suffer from discussion inconsistency, LLMs fail to reach a coherent solution, due to the misalignment between their individual contexts.In this paper, we introduce a multi-LLM context learning method (M2CL) that learns a context generator for each agent, capable of dynamically generating context instructions per discussion round via automatic information organization and refinement. Specifically, inspired by our theoretical insights on the context instruction, M2CL train the generators to control context coherence and output discrepancies via a carefully crafted self-adaptive mechanism.It enables LLMs to avoid premature convergence on majority noise and progressively reach the correct consensus. We evaluate M2CL on challenging tasks, including academic reasoning, embodied tasks, and mobile control. The results show that the performance of M2CL significantly surpasses existing methods by 20%--50%, while enjoying favorable transferability and computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of large language models into autonomous agents introduces adversarial failures that exploit legitimate tool privileges, transforming safety evaluation in tool-augmented environments from a subjective NLP task into an objective control problem. We formalize this threat model as Tag-Along Attacks: a scenario where a tool-less adversary "tags along" on the trusted privileges of a safety-aligned Operator to induce prohibited tool use through conversation alone. To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate). Our work establishes Tag-Along Attacks as a first-class, verifiable threat model and shows that effective agentic attacks can be elicited from off-the-shelf open-weight models through environment interaction alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breaking a norm elicits both material and emotional consequences, yet how this coupling arose evolutionarily remains unclear. We investigate this question in light of emerging work suggesting that normativity's building blocks emerged earlier in evolution than previously considered, arguing that normative processes should inform accounts of how even ancient capacities such as mood evolved. Using a definition of normative processes we developed, we created an agent-based model with evolvable affect in a shared resource dilemma, comparing competition (non-normative) versus punishment (normative) conditions. Critically, different mood mechanisms emerge under each condition. Under competition, agents evolve a "bad mood -&gt; consume more" response, creating a tragedy of the commons leading to resource depletion and population collapse. Under punishment, agents evolve a "bad mood -&gt; consume less" mechanism, where negative affect functions as an implicit signal of social sanction, promoting resource conservation. Importantly, once normative logic is imprinted through punishment, it creates an evolutionary pathway for mood-based signalling that operates without costly physical enforcement. Our findings demonstrate how normative processes enable social preferences to emerge in a distributed manner within psychological mechanisms, showing how normative processes reprogram cognitive and physiological systems by embedding cultural patterns into psychological dispositions.</description>

      <title>BMG-Q: Localized Bipartite Match Graph Attention Q-Learning for Ride-Pooling Order Dispatch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Localized Bipartite Match Graph Attention Q-Learning (BMG-Q), a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm framework tailored for ride-pooling order dispatch. BMG-Q advances ride-pooling decision-making process with the localized bipartite match graph underlying the Markov Decision Process, enabling the development of novel Graph Attention Double Deep Q Network (GATDDQN) as the MARL backbone to capture the dynamic interactions among ride-pooling vehicles in fleet. Our approach enriches the state information for each agent with GATDDQN by leveraging a localized bipartite interdependence graph and enables a centralized global coordinator to optimize order matching and agent behavior using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Enhanced by gradient clipping and localized graph sampling, our GATDDQN improves scalability and robustness. Furthermore, the inclusion of a posterior score function in the ILP captures the online exploration-exploitation trade-off and reduces the potential overestimation bias of agents, thereby elevating the quality of the derived solutions. Through extensive experiments and validation, BMG-Q has demonstrated superior performance in both training and operations for thousands of vehicle agents, outperforming benchmark reinforcement learning frameworks by around 10% in accumulative rewards and showing a significant reduction in overestimation bias by over 50%. Additionally, it maintains robustness amidst task variations and fleet size changes, establishing BMG-Q as an effective, scalable, and robust framework for advancing ride-pooling order dispatch operations.</description>

      <title>Replicating the behaviour of electric vehicle drivers using an agent-based reinforcement learning model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, questions remain about their efficiency in meeting the growing needs of EV drivers. Previous simulation-based approaches, which rely on static behavioural rules, have struggled to capture the adaptive behaviours of human drivers. Although reinforcement learning has been introduced in EV simulation studies, its application has primarily focused on optimising fleet operations rather than modelling private drivers who make independent charging decisions. To address the gap, we propose a multi-stage reinforcement learning framework that simulates charging demand of private EV drivers across a national-scale road network. We validate the model against real-world data and identify the training stage that most closely reflects actual driver behaviour, which captures both the adaptive behaviours and bounded rationality of private drivers. Based on the simulation results, we also identify critical 'charging deserts' where EV drivers consistently have low state of charge. Our findings also highlight recent policy shifts toward expanding rapid charging hubs along motorway corridors and city boundaries to meet the demand from long-distance trips.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Multi-Agent Blackboard System for Information Discovery in Data Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities in data science, but their deployment is often limited by the challenge of finding relevant data in large data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: both single- and multi-agent systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files, and master-slave multi-agent systems rely on a rigid central controller that requires precise knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities, which is not possible in large-scale settings where the main agent lacks full observability over sub-agents' knowledge and competencies. We propose a novel multi-agent paradigm inspired by the blackboard architecture for traditional AI models. In our framework, a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents - either responsible for a partition of the data lake or retrieval from the web - volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design improves scalability and flexibility by removing the need for a central coordinator to know each agent's expertise or internal knowledge. We evaluate the approach on three benchmarks that require data discovery: KramaBench and modified versions of DSBench and DA-Code. Results show that the blackboard architecture substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving 13%-57% relative improvements in end-to-end success and up to a 9% relative gain in data discovery F1 over the best baseline.</description>

Abstract: This book is an introductory textbook targeted towards computer science students who are completely new to the topic of automated negotiation. It does not require any prerequisite knowledge, except for elementary mathematics and basic programming skills.
  This book comes with an simple toy-world negotiation framework implemented in Python that can be used by the readers to implement their own negotiation algorithms and perform experiments with them. This framework is small and simple enough that any reader who does not like to work in Python should be able to re-implement it very quickly in any other programming language of their choice.</description>

      <title>MAS-Shield: A Defense Framework for Secure and Efficient LLM MAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are susceptible to linguistic attacks that can trigger cascading failures across the network. Existing defenses face a fundamental dilemma: lightweight single-auditor methods are prone to single points of failure, while robust committee-based approaches incur prohibitive computational costs in multi-turn interactions. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{MAS-Shield}, a secure and efficient defense framework designed with a coarse-to-fine filtering pipeline. Rather than applying uniform scrutiny, MAS-Shield dynamically allocates defense resources through a three-stage protocol: (1) \textbf{Critical Agent Selection } strategically targets high-influence nodes to narrow the defense surface; (2) \textbf{Light Auditing} employs lightweight sentry models to rapidly filter the majority of benign cases; and (3) \textbf{Global Consensus Auditing} escalates only suspicious or ambiguous signals to a heavyweight committee for definitive arbitration. This hierarchical design effectively optimizes the security-efficiency trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that MAS-Shield achieves a 92.5\% recovery rate against diverse adversarial scenarios and reduces defense latency by over 70\% compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>When Personas Override Payoffs: Role Identity Bias in Multi-Agent LLM Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems for strategic tasks, yet how design choices such as role-based personas and payoff visibility affect reasoning remains poorly understood. We investigate whether multi-agent systems function as strategic reasoners capable of payoff optimization or as identity-driven actors that prioritize role alignment over explicit incentives. Using Nash equilibrium achievement as a diagnostic for strategic reasoning, we conduct systematic experiments across four LLM architectures (Qwen-7B, Qwen-32B, Llama-8B, Mistral-7B) in complex environmental decision-making games involving four agents. We show that role identity bias fundamentally alters strategic reasoning even when payoff-optimal equilibria exist and complete payoff information is available. Removing personas and providing explicit payoffs enables Qwen models to achieve high Nash equilibrium rates, indicating that both conditions are necessary for strategic reasoning. In contrast, personas systematically bias equilibrium selection toward socially preferred outcomes: with personas present, all of the achieved equilibria correspond to Green Transition, while models entirely fail to reach equilibrium when Tragedy of the Commons is payoff-optimal. The effect of explicit payoffs depends entirely on persona presence, revealing strong interactions between representational design choices. We also observe clear model-dependent patterns. Qwen architectures are highly sensitive to both personas and payoff visibility, whereas Llama and Mistral exhibit rigid reasoning behavior across conditions. These findings demonstrate that representational choices are substantive governance decisions that determine whether multi-agent systems act as strategic reasoners or identity-driven actors, with important implications for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Design: Optimizing Agents with Better Prompts and Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models, employed as multiple agents that interact and collaborate with each other, have excelled at solving complex tasks. The agents are programmed with prompts that declare their functionality, along with the topologies that orchestrate interactions across agents. Designing prompts and topologies for multi-agent systems (MAS) is inherently complex. To automate the entire design process, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the design space aiming to understand the factors behind building effective MAS. We reveal that prompts together with topologies play critical roles in enabling more effective MAS design. Based on the insights, we propose Multi-Agent System Search (MASS), a MAS optimization framework that efficiently exploits the complex MAS design space by interleaving its optimization stages, from local to global, from prompts to topologies, over three stages: 1) block-level (local) prompt optimization; 2) workflow topology optimization; 3) workflow-level (global) prompt optimization, where each stage is conditioned on the iteratively optimized prompts/topologies from former stages. We show that MASS-optimized multi-agent systems outperform a spectrum of existing alternatives by a substantial margin. Based on the MASS-found systems, we finally propose design principles behind building effective multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Scientific Intelligence: A Survey of LLM-based Scientific Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As scientific research becomes increasingly complex, innovative tools are needed to manage vast data, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and accelerate discovery. Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into LLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks ranging from hypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific knowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them to handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific breakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures, design, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding LLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents and the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields. By examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents for more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Past-Discounting is Key for Learning Markovian Fairness with Long Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness is an important consideration for dynamic resource allocation in multi-agent systems. Many existing methods treat fairness as a one-shot problem without considering temporal dynamics, which misses the nuances of accumulating inequalities over time. Recent approaches overcome this limitation by tracking allocations over time, assuming perfect recall of all past utilities. While the former neglects long-term equity, the latter introduces a critical challenge: the augmented state space required to track cumulative utilities grows unboundedly with time, hindering the scalability and convergence of learning algorithms. Motivated by behavioral insights that human fairness judgments discount distant events, we introduce a framework for temporal fairness that incorporates past-discounting into the learning problem. This approach offers a principled interpolation between instantaneous and perfect-recall fairness. Our central contribution is a past-discounted framework for memory tracking and a theoretical analysis of fairness memories, showing past-discounting guarantees a bounded, horizon-independent state space, a property that we prove perfect-recall methods lack. This result unlocks the ability to learn fair policies tractably over arbitrarily long horizons. We formalize this framework, demonstrate its necessity with experiments showing that perfect recall fails where past-discounting succeeds, and provide a clear path toward building scalable and equitable resource allocation systems.</description>

      <title>MAC: Masked Agent Collaboration Boosts Large Language Model Medical Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in artificial intelligence, where the multi-agent system (MAS) holds considerable promise for healthcare development by achieving the collaboration of LLMs. However, the absence of a systematic pipeline for agent construction and the rigidity of static collaboration patterns render current MAS-based models vulnerable to collaboration failures, resulting in substantial performance degradation in medical decision-making scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Masked Agent Collaboration (MAC) framework that harnesses Pareto-optimal agent construction and cross-consistency maximization mechanisms to achieve adaptive progressive propagation of collaborative information, boosting the medical decision-making capacity. Specifically, we first conduct a Pareto-frontier factors analysis towards the LLMs pool to consider their key factors, including the model size, inference time, diversity score, and throughput ratio, where we calculate the similarity between pairwise outputs within an LLM to derive its diversity score. Beyond this analysis, we enable the identification of Pareto-optimal models that balance efficiency and capability, which are subsequently selected as collaborative agents to consider the fundamental trade-offs inherent in practical LLM deployment. Afterward, we measure the pairwise similarity between the outputs from collaborative agents to determine their cross-consistency values, subsequently masking out the agent with the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the output that is likely semantically inconsistent. Finally, we conduct collaboration of agents by achieving adaptive progressive propagation, where each agent aggregates the outputs of unmasked agents from the previous layer as its input to generate the corresponding output via prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.</description>

      <title>DMV-AVP: Distributed Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking Using Autoware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents DMV-AVP, a distributed simulation of Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of DMAVA: 1) the Multi-Vehicle AVP Coordination Framework, composed of AVP Managers and a per-vehicle AVP Node, is responsible for global parking state tracking, vehicle queuing, parking spot reservation, lifecycle coordination, and conflict resolution across multiple vehicles, and 2) the Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module, that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh communication layer that ensures high data accuracy and controllability across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate consistent coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed DMV-AVP supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

      <title>DMAVA: Distributed Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Architecture Using Autoware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating and validating coordination among multiple autonomous vehicles remains challenging, as many existing simulation architectures are limited to single-vehicle operation or rely on centralized control. This paper presents the Distributed Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA), a simulation architecture that enables concurrent execution of multiple independent vehicle autonomy stacks distributed across multiple physical hosts within a shared simulation environment. Each vehicle operates its own complete autonomous driving stack while maintaining coordinated behavior through a data-centric communication layer. The proposed system integrates ROS 2 Humble, Autoware Universe, AWSIM Labs, and Zenoh to support high data accuracy and controllability during multi-vehicle simulation, enabling consistent perception, planning, and control behavior under distributed execution. Experiments conducted on multiple-host configurations demonstrate stable localization, reliable inter-host communication, and consistent closed-loop control under distributed execution. DMAVA also serves as a foundation for Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking, demonstrating its extensibility toward higher-level cooperative autonomy.
