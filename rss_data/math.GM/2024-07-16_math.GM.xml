      <title>On Bounds and Diophantine Properties of Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mordell equations are celebrated equations within number theory and are named after Louis Mordell, an American-born British mathematician, known for his pioneering research in number theory. In this paper, we discover all Mordell equations of the form $y^2 = x^3 + k$, where $k \in \mathbb Z$, with exactly $|k|$ integral solutions. We also discover explicit bounds for Mordell equations, parameterized families of elliptic curves and twists on elliptic curves. Using the connection between Mordell curves and binary cubic forms, we improve the lower bound for the number of integral solutions of a Mordell curve by looking at a pair of curves with unusually high rank.</description>

      <title>Solving Obstacle Problems using Optimal Homotopy Asymptotic Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations have void applications in several practical situations, sciences, and non sciences as Euler Lagrange equation in classical mechanics, Radioactive decay in nuclear physics, Navier Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, Verhulst equation in biological population growth, Hodgkin Huxley model in neural action potentials, etc. The cantilever bridge problem is very important in Bridge Engineering and this can be modeled as a homogeneous obstacle problem in Mathematics. Due to this and various other applications, obstacle problems become an important part of our literature. A lot of work is dedicated to the solution of the obstacle problems. However, obstacle problems are not solved by the considered method in the literature we have visited. In this work, we have investigated the finding of the exact solution to several obstacle problems using the optimal homotopy asymptotic method (OHAM). The graphical representation of results represents the symmetry among them.</description>

      <title>Fractoconvex structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:1710.04263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new structure on a space endowed with convexities, and call it a fractoconvex structure (or, a space with fractoconvexity). We introduce two operations on a set of fractoconvexities and in a special case we show that they satisfy the laws for a distributive lattice. We establish a connection between fractoconvex sets and convex sets using the concept of independent convexities, based on the possibility of representing a fractoconvex set as the intersection of its convex hulls. Finally, we consider some examples of fractoconvexities on the 2-sphere and on $\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the p-adic valuation trees of degree-2 and degree-3 polynomials in two variables over any prime p, building upon prior research outlined in [14].</description>
