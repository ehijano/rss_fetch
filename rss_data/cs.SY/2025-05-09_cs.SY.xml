      <title>Geometric Fault-Tolerant Neural Network Tracking Control of Unknown Systems on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space $\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.</description>

      <title>Joint User Association and Bandwidth Assignment for Digital Twin-Assisted Multi-RAT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate user equipment (UE)-radio access technology (RAT) association and bandwidth assignment to maximize sum-rates in a multi-RAT network. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly addresses UE association and bandwidth allocation, adhering to practical constraints. Because of the NP-hard nature of this problem, finding a globally optimal solution is computationally infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a centralized and computationally efficient heuristic algorithm that aims to maximize sum-rates while enhancing quality of service (QoS). Yet, the proposed approach requires global channel state information (CSI) for near-optimal performance, which incurs substantial overhead and data collection costs in large-scale multi-RAT networks. To alleviate this burden, we use a digital twin (DT) of the multi-RAT network, leveraging its context-awareness to acquire global CSI with reduced overhead. Our numerical results reveal that our approach improves sum-rates by up to 43% over baseline method, with less than a 5% deviation from the theoretical optimal solution, while achieving up to a 43% improvement in QoS. Further analysis reveals that our method not only surpasses the optimal solution in terms of QoS enhancement, but also ensures significant computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning Economic Model Predictive Control via Clustering and Kernel-Based Lipschitz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning economic model predictive control scheme for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to input and state constraints and unknown dynamics. We design a fast and accurate Lipschitz regression method using input and output data that combines clustering and kernel regression to learn the unknown dynamics. In each cluster, the parallel convex optimization problems are solved to estimate the kernel weights and reduce the Lipschitz constant of the predictor, hence limiting the error propagation in the prediction horizon. We derive the two different bounds of learning errors in deterministic and probabilistic forms and customize a new robust constraint-tightening strategy for the discontinuous predictor. Then, the learning economic model predictive control algorithm is formulated by introducing a stabilized optimization problem to construct a Lyapunov function. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations of a numerical example and a continuously stirred tank reactor.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Robust Tracking Control: An Online Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses the tracking control problem for nonlinear systems subjected to unknown external disturbances. Inspired by contraction theory, a neural network-dirven CCM synthesis is adopted to obtain a feedback controller that could track any feasible trajectory. Based on the observation that the system states under continuous control input inherently contain embedded information about unknown external disturbances, we propose an online learning scheme that captures the disturbances dyanmics from online historical data and embeds the compensation within the CCM controller. The proposed scheme operates as a plug-and-play module that intrinsically enhances the tracking performance of CCM synthesis. The numerical simulations on tethered space robot and PVTOL demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed scheme. The source code of the proposed online learning scheme can be found at https://github.com/NPU-RCIR/Online_CCM.git.</description>

      <title>Predictive Control of EV Overnight Charging with Multi-Session Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of electric vehicles (EVs) are charged domestically overnight, where the precise timing of power allocation is not important to the user, thus representing a source of flexibility that can be leveraged by charging control algorithms. In this paper, we relax the common assumption, that EVs require full charge every morning, enabling additional flexibility to defer charging of surplus energy to subsequent nights, which can enhance the performance of controlled charging. In particular, we consider a simple domestic smart plug, scheduling power delivery with the objective to minimize CO$_2$ emissions over prediction horizons of multiple sessions -- up to seven days ahead -- utilising model predictive control (MPC). Based on carbon intensity data from the UK National Grid, we demonstrate significant potential for emission reductions with multi-session planning of 40 to 46\% compared to uncontrolled charging and 19 to 26\% compared to single-session planning. Furthermore, we assess, how the driving and charging behaviour of EV users affects the available flexibility and consequentially the potential for emission reductions. Finally, using grid carbon intensity data from 14 different UK regions, we report significant variations in absolute emission reductions based on the local energy mix.</description>

      <title>Day-Ahead Bidding Strategies for Wind Farm Operators under a One-Price Balancing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.</description>

      <title>LAPSO: A Unified Optimization View for Learning-Augmented Power System Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components. All code and data are available at https://github.com/xuwkk/lapso_exp.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Biased User Scheduling for Heterogeneous Wireless Federate Learning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized collaborative model training in distributed networks, prioritizing data privacy and communication efficiency. This paper investigates efficient deployment of FL in wireless heterogeneous networks, focusing on strategies to accelerate convergence despite stragglers. The primary objective is to minimize long-term convergence wall-clock time through optimized user scheduling and resource allocation. While stragglers may introduce delays in a single round, their inclusion can expedite subsequent rounds, particularly when they possess critical information. Moreover, balancing single-round duration with the number of cumulative rounds, compounded by dynamic training and transmission conditions, necessitates a novel approach beyond conventional optimization solutions. To tackle these challenges, convergence analysis with respect to adaptive and biased scheduling is derived. Then, by factoring in real-time system and statistical information, including diverse energy constraints and users' energy harvesting capabilities, a deep reinforcement learning approach, empowered by proximal policy optimization, is employed to adaptively select user sets. For the scheduled users, Lagrangian decomposition is applied to optimize local resource utilization, further enhancing system efficiency. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for various FL tasks, demonstrating reduced task time compared to existing benchmarks under various settings.</description>

      <title>High Altitude Platform-Based Caching and Multicasting for Rural Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing efficient and reliable content delivery in rural areas remains a significant challenge due to the lack of communication infrastructure. To bridge the digital divide, this paper investigates the potential of leveraging multiple high-altitude platforms (HAPs) for energy-efficient content delivery in wide rural regions. Each caching-enabled HAP is equipped with both Free-Space Optical (FSO) transceivers for backhaul links and Radio Frequency (RF) antenna arrays for access links. To further enhance network efficiency, we consider a network coding-based multicasting scheme, where different types of content are treated as distinct multicast sessions. With the objective of minimizing long-term power cost, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates deep reinforcement learn-ing (DRL) and convex optimization to jointly optimize dynamic caching strategies and resource allocation across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces power cost compared to several baseline approaches, providing a practical solution for improving rural connectivity.</description>

      <title>CV-MP: Max-Pressure Control in Heterogeneously Distributed and Partially Connected Vehicle Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-pressure (MP) control has emerged as a prominent real-time network traffic signal control strategy due to its simplicity, decentralized structure, and theoretical guarantees of network queue stability. Meanwhile, advances in connected vehicle (CV) technology have sparked extensive research into CV-based traffic signal control. Despite these developments, few studies have investigated MP control in heterogeneously distributed and partially CV environments while ensuring network queue stability. To address these research gaps, we propose a CV-based MP control (CV-MP) method that leverages real-time CV travel time information to compute the pressure, thereby incorporating both the spatial distribution and temporal delays of vehicles, unlike existing approaches that utilized only spatial distribution or temporal delays. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for road network queue stability that are compatible with most existing MP control methods. Moreover, we pioneered the proof of network queue stability even if the vehicles are only partially connected and heterogeneously distributed, and gave a necessary condition of CV observation for maintaining the stability. Evaluation results on an Amsterdam corridor show that CV-MP significantly reduces vehicle delays compared to both actuated control and conventional MP control across various CV penetration rates. Moreover, in scenarios with dynamic traffic demand, CV-MP achieves lower spillover peaks even with low and heterogeneous CV penetration rates, further highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <title>Optimal Microgrid Sizing of Offshore Renewable Energy Sources for Offshore Platforms and Coastal Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift towards renewable energy and advanced storage solutions, driven by the urgent need for sustainable and resilient power systems. Isolated offshore communities, such as islands and offshore platforms, which traditionally rely on mainland grids or diesel generators, stand to gain significantly from renewable energy integration. Promising offshore renewable technologies include wind turbines, wave and tidal energy converters, and floating photovoltaic systems, paired with a storage solution like battery energy storage systems. This paper introduces a renewable energy microgrid optimizer (REMO), a tool designed to identify the optimal sizes of renewable generation and storage resources for offshore microgrids. A key challenge in such models is accurately accounting for battery degradation costs. To address this, the REMO model integrates a deep neural network-based battery degradation (DNN-BD) module, which factors in variables like ambient temperature, charge/discharge rates, state of charge, depth of discharge and battery health. Simulations on six test regions demonstrate that the REMO-DNN-BD approach minimizes lifetime energy costs while maintaining high reliability and sustainability, making it a viable design solution for offshore microgrid systems.</description>

      <title>Localization and path following for an autonomous e-scooter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to mitigate economical, ecological, and societal challenges in electric scooter (e-scooter) sharing systems, we develop an autonomous e-scooter prototype. Our vision is to design a fully autonomous prototype that can find its way to the next parking spot, high-demand area, or charging station. In this work, we propose a path following solution to enable localization and navigation in an urban environment with a provided path to follow. We design a closed-loop architecture that solves the localization and path following problem while allowing the e-scooter to maintain its balance with a previously developed reaction wheel mechanism. Our approach facilitates state and input constraints, e.g., adhering to the path width, while remaining executable on a Raspberry Pi 5. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a real-world experiment on our prototype.</description>

      <title>Approximation-free Control for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications using Spatiotemporal Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a spatiotemporal tube (STT)-based control framework for satisfying Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in unknown control-affine systems. We formulate STL constraints as a robust optimization problem (ROP) and recast it as a scenario optimization program (SOP) to construct STTs with formal correctness guarantees. We also propose a closed-form control law that operates independently of the system dynamics, and ensures the system trajectory evolves within the STTs, thereby satisfying the STL specifications. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior computational efficiency, trajectory quality, and applicability to complex STL tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Linearized Models from Nonlinear Systems under Initialization Constraints with Finite Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of a linear system model from data has wide applications in control theory. The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.</description>

      <title>LVLM-MPC Collaboration for Autonomous Driving: A Safety-Aware and Task-Scalable Control Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) integration framework that delivers both task scalability and safety for Autonomous Driving (AD). LVLMs excel at high-level task planning across diverse driving scenarios. However, since these foundation models are not specifically designed for driving and their reasoning is not consistent with the feasibility of low-level motion planning, concerns remain regarding safety and smooth task switching. This paper integrates LVLMs with MPC Builder, which automatically generates MPCs on demand, based on symbolic task commands generated by the LVLM, while ensuring optimality and safety. The generated MPCs can strongly assist the execution or rejection of LVLM-driven task switching by providing feedback on the feasibility of the given tasks and generating task-switching-aware MPCs. Our approach provides a safe, flexible, and adaptable control framework, bridging the gap between cutting-edge foundation models and reliable vehicle operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a simulation experiment, showing that our system can safely and effectively handle highway driving while maintaining the flexibility and adaptability of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>A Vehicle System for Navigating Among Vulnerable Road Users Including Remote Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a vehicle system capable of navigating safely and efficiently around Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists. The system comprises key modules for environment perception, localization and mapping, motion planning, and control, integrated into a prototype vehicle. A key innovation is a motion planner based on Topology-driven Model Predictive Control (T-MPC). The guidance layer generates multiple trajectories in parallel, each representing a distinct strategy for obstacle avoidance or non-passing. The underlying trajectory optimization constrains the joint probability of collision with VRUs under generic uncertainties. To address extraordinary situations ("edge cases") that go beyond the autonomous capabilities - such as construction zones or encounters with emergency responders - the system includes an option for remote human operation, supported by visual and haptic guidance. In simulation, our motion planner outperforms three baseline approaches in terms of safety and efficiency. We also demonstrate the full system in prototype vehicle tests on a closed track, both in autonomous and remotely operated modes.</description>

      <title>Semi-Explicit Solution of Some Discrete-Time Mean-Field-Type Games with Higher-Order Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional solvable game theory and mean-field-type game theory (risk-aware games) predominantly focus on quadratic costs due to their analytical tractability. Nevertheless, they often fail to capture critical non-linearities inherent in real-world systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for solving discrete-time game problems with higher-order state and strategy costs involving power-law terms. We derive semi-explicit expressions for equilibrium strategies, cost-to-go functions, and recursive coefficient dynamics across deterministic, stochastic, and multi-agent system settings by convex-completion techniques. The contributions include variance-aware solutions under additive and multiplicative noise, extensions to mean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and conditions that ensure the positivity of recursive coefficients. Our results provide a foundational methodology for analyzing non linear multi-agent systems under higher-order penalization, bridging classical game theory and mean-field-type game theory with modern computational tools for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>On Incremental Stability of Interconnected Switched Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the incremental stability of interconnected switched nonlinear systems is discussed. The nature of switching considered is state-dependent. The incremental stability of the switched interconnected system is a stronger property compared to the conventional notion of stability. Even if individual systems in the interconnected setting are stable, guaranteeing stability for the overall system is challenging. However, one of the important features of incremental stability is that the notion is preserved over interconnection. Here, leveraging the contraction-theoretic tools, we derive a set of sufficient conditions for the overall interconnection consisting of bimodal switched systems. To showcase the wider usability of our proposed results, we have also included the effect of external input, which leads to the study of incremental input-to-state stability ($\delta$-ISS). For the case of feedback interconnection, the small gain characterisation is presented for the overall system's $\delta$-ISS. Further, for a special case of feedback, i.e., cascade interconnection, the results are derived. The derived conditions are based on the matrix measure, making it computationally tractable and general. To make the results more general, a generalised interconnection of bimodal switched systems is studied and corresponding sufficient condition for $\delta$-ISS are presented. Two numerical examples are demonstrated and supported with simulation results to verify the theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>Fast Whole-Body Strain Regulation in Continuum Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose reaching steps towards the real-time strain control of multiphysics, multiscale continuum soft robots. To study this problem fundamentally, we ground ourselves in a model-based control setting enabled by mathematically precise dynamics of a soft robot prototype. Poised to integrate, rather than reject, inherent mechanical nonlinearities for embodied compliance, we first separate the original robot dynamics into separate subdynamics -- aided by a perturbing time-scale separation parameter. Second, we prescribe a set of stabilizing nonlinear backstepping controllers for regulating the resulting subsystems' strain dynamics. Third, we study the interconnected singularly perturbed system by analyzing and establishing its stability. Fourth, our theories are backed up by fast numerical results on a single arm of the Octopus robot arm. We demonstrate strain regulation to equilibrium, in a significantly reduced time, of the whole-body reduced-order dynamics of an infinite degrees-of-freedom soft robot. This paper communicates our thinking within the backdrop of embodied intelligence: it informs our conceptualization, formulation, computational setup, and yields improved control performance for infinite degrees-of-freedom soft robots.</description>

      <title>Learning Stable Koopman Embeddings for Identification and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces new model parameterizations for learning discrete-time dynamical systems from data via the Koopman operator and studies their properties. Whereas most existing works on Koopman learning do not take into account the stability or stabilizability of the model -- two fundamental pieces of prior knowledge about a given system to be identified -- in this paper, we propose new classes of Koopman models that have built-in guarantees of these properties. These guarantees are achieved through a novel {\em direct parameterization approach} that leads to {\em unconstrained} optimization problems over their parameter sets. {These results rely on the invertibility of the vector fields for autonomous systems and the generalized feedback linearizability (under smooth feedback), respectively.} To explore the representational flexibility of these model sets, we establish the theoretical connections between the stability of discrete-time Koopman embedding and contraction-based forms of nonlinear stability and stabilizability. The proposed approach is illustrated in applications to stable nonlinear system identification and imitation learning via stabilizable models. Simulation results empirically show that the proposed learning approaches outperform prior methods lacking stability guarantees.</description>

      <title>Formulating the Restoration of Distribution Networks as a Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Severe weather events can cause extensive damage to electrical distribution networks, requiring a multi-day restoration effort. Optimizing the dispatch of repair crews minimizes the severe socio-economic consequences of such events. Considering both repair times and travel times, we use graphical manipulations to transform this multiple crew scheduling problem into a type of traveling salesman problem(TSP). Specifically, we demonstrate that the restoration problem bears major resemblance to an instance of a cost constrained reward maximizing mTSP (multiple TSP) on node and edge weighted (doubly weighted) graphs (a variant we dub the CCRM-mTSP-DW), where the objective is to maximize the aggregate reward earned during the upcoming restoration window, provided no crew violates its time budget and electrical continuity constraints are met. Despite the rich history of research on the TSP and its variants, this CCRM-mTSP-DW variant has not been studied before, although its closest cousin happens to be the "Selective TSP" (S-TSP). This reinterpretation of the restoration problem not only opens up the possibility of drawing on existing solution methods developed for the TSP and its variants, it also adds a new chapter in the annals of research on "TSP-like'' problems. In this paper, we propose a "TSP-like'' mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving the restoration problem and validate it on the IEEE PES 123-node test feeder network.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are vital in modern traffic management and optimization, significantly enhancing traffic efficiency and safety. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as transformative tools for addressing complex challenges within ITS. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of diffusion models for ITS, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. First, we introduce the theoretical foundations of diffusion models and their key variants, including conditional diffusion models and latent diffusion models, highlighting their suitability for modeling complex, multi-modal traffic data and enabling controllable generation. Second, we outline the primary challenges in ITS and the corresponding advantages of diffusion models, providing readers with a deeper understanding of the intersection between ITS and diffusion models. Third, we offer a multi-perspective investigation of current applications of diffusion models in ITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, trajectory prediction, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion model techniques and highlight key ITS research directions that warrant further investigation. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for ITS, thereby advancing their future applications in the transportation domain.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Relative-Switched Threshold Strategies for Consensus Tracking Control of Nonlinear Multiagent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates event-triggered consensus tracking in nonlinear semi-strict-feedback multi-agent systems involving one leader and multiple followers. We first employ radial basis function neural networks and backstepping techniques to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics, facilitating the design of dual observers to measure the unknown states and disturbances. Then three adaptive event-triggered control schemes are proposed: fixed-threshold, relative-threshold, and switched-threshold configurations, each featuring specialized controller architectures and triggering mechanisms. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, we establish that the follower agents can asymptotically track the reference trajectory of the leader, meanwhile all error signals remain uniform bounded. Our proposed control strategies effectively prevent Zeno behaviors through stringent exclusion criteria. Finally, an illustrative example is presented, demonstrating the competitive performance of our control framework in achieving consensus tracking and optimizing triggering efficiency.</description>

      <title>On Space-Filling Input Design for Nonlinear Dynamic Model Learning: A Gaussian Process Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While optimal input design for linear systems has been well-established, no systematic approach exists for nonlinear systems where robustness to extrapolation/interpolation errors is prioritized over minimizing estimated parameter variance. To address this issue, we develop a novel space-filling input design strategy for nonlinear system identification that ensures data coverage of a given region of interest. By placing a Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the joint input-state space, the proposed strategy leverages the GP posterior variance to construct a cost function that promotes space-filling input design. Consequently, this enables maximization of the coverage in the region of interest, thereby facilitating the generation of informative datasets. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that minimization of the cost function implies the space-filling property of the obtained data. Effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on both an academic and a mass-spring-damper example, highlighting its potential practical impact on efficient exploration of the dynamics of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Symbolic and User-friendly Geometric Algebra Routines (SUGAR) for Computations in Matlab</title>

Abstract: Geometric algebra (GA) is a mathematical tool for geometric computing, providing a framework that allows a unified and compact approach to geometric relations which in other mathematical systems are typically described using different more complicated elements. This fact has led to an increasing adoption of GA in applied mathematics and engineering problems. However, the scarcity of symbolic implementations of GA and its inherent complexity, requiring a specific mathematical background, make it challenging and less intuitive for engineers to work with. This prevents wider adoption among more applied professionals. To address this challenge, this paper introduces SUGAR (Symbolic and User-friendly Geometric Algebra Routines), an open-source toolbox designed for Matlab and licensed under the MIT License. SUGAR facilitates the translation of GA concepts into Matlab and provides a collection of user-friendly functions tailored for GA computations, including support for symbolic operations. It supports both numeric and symbolic computations in high-dimensional GAs. Specifically tailored for applied mathematics and engineering applications, SUGAR has been meticulously engineered to represent geometric elements and transformations within two and three-dimensional projective and conformal geometric algebras, aligning with established computational methodologies in the literature. Furthermore, SUGAR efficiently handles functions of multivectors, such as exponential, logarithmic, sinusoidal, and cosine functions, enhancing its applicability across various engineering domains, including robotics, control systems, and power electronics. Finally, this work includes four distinct validation examples, demonstrating SUGAR's capabilities across the above-mentioned fields and its practical utility in addressing real-world applied mathematics and engineering problems.</description>

      <title>C-MORL: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning through Efficient Discovery of Pareto Front</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) excels at handling rapidly changing preferences in tasks that involve multiple criteria, even for unseen preferences. However, previous dominating MORL methods typically generate a fixed policy set or preference-conditioned policy through multiple training iterations exclusively for sampled preference vectors, and cannot ensure the efficient discovery of the Pareto front. Furthermore, integrating preferences into the input of policy or value functions presents scalability challenges, in particular as the dimension of the state and preference space grow, which can complicate the learning process and hinder the algorithm's performance on more complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Pareto front discovery algorithm called Constrained MORL (C-MORL), which serves as a seamless bridge between constrained policy optimization and MORL. Concretely, a set of policies is trained in parallel in the initialization stage, with each optimized towards its individual preference over the multiple objectives. Then, to fill the remaining vacancies in the Pareto front, the constrained optimization steps are employed to maximize one objective while constraining the other objectives to exceed a predefined threshold. Empirically, compared to recent advancements in MORL methods, our algorithm achieves more consistent and superior performances in terms of hypervolume, expected utility, and sparsity on both discrete and continuous control tasks, especially with numerous objectives (up to nine objectives in our experiments).</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies equality-constrained composite minimization problems. This class of problems, capturing regularization terms and convex inequality constraints, naturally arises in a wide range of engineering and machine learning applications. To tackle these minimization problems, we introduce the \emph{proportional--integral proximal gradient dynamics} (PI--PGD): a closed-loop system where the Lagrange multipliers are control inputs and states are the problem decision variables. First, we establish the equivalence between the minima of the optimization problem and the equilibria of the PI--PGD. Then {for the case of affine constraints}, {by} leveraging tools from contraction theory we give a comprehensive convergence analysis for the dynamics, showing linear--exponential convergence towards the equilibrium. That is, the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. Our findings are illustrated numerically on a set of representative examples, which include an application to entropy-regularized optimal transport.</description>
