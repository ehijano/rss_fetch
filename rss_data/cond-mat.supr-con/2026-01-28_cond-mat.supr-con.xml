      <title>AC Response Across the Metal Insulator Transition of YBCO Josephson Junctions Fabricated with a Helium Ion Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using focused helium ion beam (FHIB) irradiation, we fabricated in-plane, high-Tc YBCO Josephson junctions. By varying the dose of the irradiation, we tune the junction barriers from metallic (SNS) to insulating (SIS) and investigate how this transition affects microwave-driven dynamics. As the barrier transitions from metallic to insulating, the oscillatory response of the Shapiro steps to the RF power changes dramatically. On either side of the metal-insulator transition, the devices exhibit clean integer Shapiro steps without half-integer features, demonstrating that the current--phase relation is dominated by the first harmonic and that the excess current is minimal. The current-voltage response is well-described by the resistively, capacitively shunted junction model assuming a single-harmonic current--phase relation. This behavior indicates well-controlled junction properties suitable for a wide range of superconducting electronics, including detectors, mixers, and high-density integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Paramagnetically driven superconducting re-entrance in Eu-doped infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakthrough discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates, and subsequently in several superconducting nickelates with more complex layered structures, capped a search spanning more than two decades and opened an entirely new field of research. Significant efforts aim to increase the critical temperature, to determine the electronic structure of the system, the underlying pairing mechanism, and the similarities between this system and cuprates - Ni1+ in infinite-layer nickelates being isoelectronic to Cu2+ in high-Tc cuprates. Here, we explore the unique role of magnetic rare earth ions in superconducting Eu-doped NdNiO2. We show that the field-induced re-entrant superconductivity which we evidence in this compound is the result of a delicate balance between the competing effects of the Eu2+ and Nd3+ ions. Our analyses of the extraordinary Hall effect and modeling of the superconducting critical fields demonstrate that the influence of these ions on magneto-transport is only felt when they are polarized by a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transitions in an infinite-layer samarium nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity arises from the global phase coherence of Cooper pairs. The modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for the study of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transitions in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transitions are predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, with Cooper pairs involved in the charge transport across the transitions. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively in finite and down to zero magnetic fields. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices at the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic-Ising superconductivity in p-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a possibility of superconductivity in the p-wave magnets. These are recently discovered materials that have zero net magnetization by symmetry and finite non-relativistic spin splitting of electron bands, like in altermagnets. Similarly, the spin polarizations is collinear in the momentum space. Yet, as opposed to altermagnets, the magnetization is noncollinear in the real space, and the spin splitting obeys time-reversal symmetry in the momentum space. As a result, if such material harbors superconductivity (due to phonons, or any other mechanism), the only supported superconducting symmetry is Ising superconductivity, an exotic symmetry where any Cooper pair is a 50:50 mix of singlet and triplet. This unusual behavior is also in stark contrast to regular antiferromagnet, which can support Cooper pairs of any parity, and altermagnets, which can only support nonunitary triplet pairs. The presence of large triplet component and enhanced resilience against pair breaking is inherent to the p-wave magnets and as such is unconventional as it does not materialize in conventional spin-orbit coupling induced Ising superconductors.</description>

      <title>Cooper Condensation and Pair Wave Functions in Strongly Correlated Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying superconducting states of matter without prior assumptions is a central challenge in strongly correlated electron systems. We introduce a canonical framework for diagnosing the formation of Cooper pair condensates based on the Penrose-Onsager criterion, in which superconducting order is encoded in the spectral properties of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM). Within this formulation, the symmetry and structure of the condensate are obtained by projecting the 2RDM onto irreducible representations of the underlying symmetry group, enabling an unbiased identification of both conventional and exotic superconducting states. We demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach through applications to the two-dimensional Hubbard model, using both auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). For attractive interactions without a magnetic field, we reveal a clear finite-size scaling of the condensate fraction on square lattices of size up to $20\times 20$. The framework further provides direct access to the internal structure and extent of Cooper pairs, which we track across the BCS-BEC crossover. Moreover, it enables a clean diagnosis of the finite-momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in a magnetic field. Finally, we apply the approach to a supersolid phase in the repulsive Hubbard model with an additional next-nearest neighbor hopping $t^\prime$, where a charge-density wave coexists with a superconductor. We confirm the fragmented nature of the condensate and uncover substantial pairing correlations in the triplet channel with $p$-wave spatial symmetry in addition to the dominant singlet $d$-wave pairing. Our results establish the 2RDM-based Penrose-Onsager framework as a broadly applicable and unbiased tool for characterizing superconducting order in correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Coupled Majorana modes in a dual vortex of the Kitaev honeycomb model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev model is exactly solvable in terms of Majorana fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice and coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field, giving the possibility of $\pi$-vortices in hexagonal plaquettes. In the vortex-full sector and in the presence of a time-reversal-breaking three-spin term of strength $\kappa$, the energy spectrum is gapped and the ground state possesses an even Chern number. An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $\epsilon$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $\epsilon$ in the two limits of small or large $\kappa$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system. We contrast our results with states bound to an isolated vortex in a topological superconductor with even Chern number.</description>

      <title>Flux-tunable transmon incorporating a van der Waals superconductor via an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating van der Waals (vdW) superconductors into Josephson elements extends circuit-QED beyond conventional Al/AlO$_x$/Al tunnel junctions and enables microwave probes of unconventional condensates and subgap excitations. In this work, we realize a flux-tunable transmon whose nonlinear inductive element is an Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ Josephson junction. The tunnel barrier is formed by sequential deposition and full in-situ oxidation of ultrathin Al layers on an exfoliated 4Hb-TaS$_2$ flake, followed by deposition of a top Al electrode, yielding a robust, repeatable hybrid junction process compatible with standard transmon fabrication. Embedding the device in a three-dimensional copper cavity, we observe a SQUID-like flux-dependent spectrum that is quantitatively reproduced by a standard dressed transmon--cavity Hamiltonian, from which we extract parameters in the transmon regime. Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~\mu$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Josephson effects in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that unconventional Josephson effects can typically emerge in {\it PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer systems. When proximitized by a conventional superconductor, these heterostructures host dominant interlayer Cooper pairing that features a distinctive spin texture enabled by the strong exchange field. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for electrically tunable 0-$\pi$ oscillations in lateral Josephson junctions, controlled by an out-of-plane electric displacement field. This behavior originates from field-induced finite-momentum Cooper pairing, a hallmark of the unique layer-pseudospin structure in {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers. Furthermore, we introduce a Josephson giant magnetoresistor based on these exotic spin-layer-locked Cooper pairs, in which the supercurrent exhibits a strong dependence on the internal N\'{e}el order. Our findings establish {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers as a versatile platform for phase-controllable Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic random-access memory, with promising applications in superconducting circuits and ultralow-power computing.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity under pressure in the two-dimensional van der Waals heavy-fermion metal CeSiI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CeSiI is a newly discovered exfoliable van der Waals (vdW) heavy-fermion metal featured by a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order (TN =7.5 K) inside the Kondo coherent state below T* = 50 K. To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor junctions as thermoelectric bolometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $\tau_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $\tau_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,\mu{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.</description>

      <title>Reducing TLS loss in tantalum CPW resonators using titanium sacrificial layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a substantial reduction in two-level system loss in tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates through the use of an ultrathin titanium sacrificial layer. A 0.2nm titanium film, deposited atop pre-sputtered {\alpha}-tantalum, acts as a solid-state oxygen getter that chemically modifies the native Ta oxide at the metal-air interface. After device fabrication, the titanium layer is removed using buffered oxide etchant, leaving behind a chemically reduced Ta oxide surface. Subsequent high-vacuum annealing further suppresses two-level system loss. Resonators treated with this process exhibit internal quality factors Qi exceeding an average of 1.5 million in the single-photon regime across ten devices, over three times higher than otherwise identical devices lacking the titanium layer. These results highlight the critical role of interfacial oxide chemistry in superconducting loss and reinforce atomic-scale surface engineering as an effective approach to improving coherence in tantalum-based quantum circuits. The method is compatible with existing fabrication workflows applicable to tantalum films, offering a practical route to further extending T1 lifetimes in superconducting qubits.</description>
