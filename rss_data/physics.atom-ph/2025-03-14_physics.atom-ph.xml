      <title>A Comparison of Calcium Sources for Ion-Trap Loading via Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion technology is a leading approach for scalable quantum computing. A key element of ion trapping is reliable loading of atomic sources into the trap. While thermal atomic ovens have traditionally been used for this purpose, laser ablation has emerged as a viable alternative in recent years, offering the advantages of faster and more localized loading with lower heat dissipation. Calcium is a well-established ion for qubit applications. Here we examine a range of calcium sources for ablation and provide a comprehensive analysis of each. We consider factors such as ease of use, temperature and yield of the ablation plume, and the lifetime of ablation spots. For each target, we estimate the number of trappable atoms per ablation pulse for a typical surface and 3D ion trap.</description>

      <title>Observation of the acoustic Purcell effect with a color-center and a nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement witness for combined atom interferometer-mechanical oscillator setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to entangle an atom interferometer and a macroscopic mechanical oscillator in order to create non-classical states of the oscillator. We propose an entanglement witness, from whose violation, the generation of entanglement can be determined. We do this for both the noiseless case and when including thermal noise. Thermal noise can arise from two sources: the first being when the oscillator starts in a thermal state, and the second when a continuous thermal bath is in contact with the oscillator. We find that for the appropriate oscillator quality factor $Q$, violation always exists for any value of magnetic coupling $\lambda$ and thermal occupancy $\bar n$. Cooling the oscillator to its ground state provides an $O(\bar n)$ improvement in the EW violation than starting in a thermal state. However, this still requires at least 10$^{5}$ measurements to be determined. We then consider how to use magnetic interactions to realize this idea.</description>

      <title>Enhanced multichannel dual-comb spectroscopy of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multichannel dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) approach for high-resolution, broadband spectral measurements is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying complex atomic systems. By implementing a photodetector array, we enhance DCS capabilities, addressing the fundamental trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral coverage. To resolve ambiguities in frequency conversion, we introduced a relative offset in the radio frequency (RF) comb teeth, ensuring accurate spectral reconstruction. As a proof of concept, the absorption spectrum of samarium (Sm) vapor is investigated over a 52nm range, and several previously unreported absorption lines are detected. This is a step toward "Spectroscopy 2.0", enabling massively parallel spectroscopic measurements (including those at &gt;100 T magnetic fields) crucial for atomic physics and fundamental interactions research.</description>
