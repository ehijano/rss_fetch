      <title>A Test of the Thermodynamics of Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has extended methods from the fields of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics into other disciplines. Most notably, one recent work creates a unified theoretical framework to understand evolutionary biology, machine learning, and thermodynamics. We present simulations of biological evolution used to test this framework. The test simulates organisms whose behavior is determined by specific parameters that play the role of genes. These genes are passed on to new simulated organisms with the capacity to mutate, allowing adaption of the organisms to the environment. With this simulation, we are able to test the the framework in question. The results of our simulation are consistent with the work being tested, providing evidence for it.</description>

      <title>Local search for valued constraint satisfaction parameterized by treedepth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sometimes local search algorithms cannot efficiently find even local peaks. To understand why, I look at the structure of ascents in fitness landscapes from valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs). Given a VCSP with a constraint graph of treedepth $d$, I prove that from any initial assignment there always exists an ascent of length $2^{d + 1} \cdot n$ to a local peak. This means that short ascents always exist in fitness landscapes from constraint graphs of logarithmic treedepth, and thus also for all VCSPs of bounded treewidth. But this does not mean that local search algorithms will always find and follow such short ascents in sparse VCSPs. I show that with loglog treedepth, superpolynomial ascents exist; and for polylog treedepth, there are initial assignments from which all ascents are superpolynomial. Together, these results suggest that the study of sparse VCSPs can help us better understand the barriers to efficient local search.</description>

      <title>Principles of bursty mRNA expression and irreversibility in single cells and extrinsically varying populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical model of mRNA expression is the telegraph model, describing a gene that switches on and off, subject to transcription and decay. It describes steady-state mRNA distributions that subscribe to transcription in bursts with first-order decay, referred to as super-Poissonian expression. Using a telegraph-like model, I propose an answer to the question of why gene expression is bursty in the first place, and what benefits it confers. Using analytics for the entropy production rate, I find that entropy production is maximal when the on and off switching rates between the gene states are approximately equal. This is related to a lower bound on the free energy necessary to keep the system out of equilibrium, meaning that bursty gene expression may have evolved in part due to free energy efficiency. It is shown that there are trade-offs between having slow nuclear export, which can reduce cytoplasmic mRNA noise, and the energy required to keep the system out of equilibrium -- nuclear compartmentalization comes with an associated free energy cost. At the population level, I find that extrinsic variation, manifested in cell-to-cell differences in kinetic parameters, can make the system more or less reversible -- and potentially energy efficient -- depending on where the noise is located. This highlights that there evolutionary constraints on the suppression of extrinsic noise, whose origin is in cellular heterogeneity, in addition to intrinsic randomness arising from molecular collisions. Finally, I investigate the partially observed nature of most mRNA expression data which seems to obey detailed balance, yet remains unavoidably out-of-equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Exponential Steepest Ascent from Valued Constraint Graphs of Pathwidth Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the complexity of maximising fitness via local search on valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs). We consider two kinds of local ascents: (1) steepest ascents, where each step changes the domain that produces a maximal increase in fitness; and (2) $\prec$-ordered ascents, where -- of the domains with available fitness increasing changes -- each step changes the $\prec$-minimal domain. We provide a general padding argument to simulate any ordered ascent by a steepest ascent. We construct a VCSP that is a path of binary constraints between alternating 2-state and 3-state domains with exponentially long ordered ascents. We apply our padding argument to this VCSP to obtain a Boolean VCSP that has a constraint (hyper)graph of arity 5 and pathwidth 4 with exponential steepest ascents. This is an improvement on the previous best known construction for long steepest ascents, which had arity 8 and pathwidth 7.</description>

      <title>The mutation process on the ancestral line under selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Moran model of population genetics with two types, mutation, and selection, and investigate the line of descent of a randomly-sampled individual from a contemporary population. We trace this ancestral line back into the distant past, far beyond the most recent common ancestor of the population (thus connecting population genetics to phylogeny), and analyse the mutation process along this line.
  To this end, we use the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph, which consists of a set of potential ancestors of the sampled individual at any given time. Relative to the neutral case (that is, without selection), we obtain a general bias towards the beneficial type, an increase in the beneficial mutation rate, and a decrease in the deleterious mutation rate. This sheds new light on previous analytical results. We discuss our findings in the light of a well-known observation at the interface of phylogeny and population genetics, namely, the difference in the mutation rates (or, more precisely, mutation fluxes) estimated via phylogenetic methods relative to those observed in pedigree studies.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal modeling of co-dynamics of smallpox, measles and pertussis in pre-healthcare Finland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infections are known to interact as previous infections may have an effect on risk of succumbing to a new infection. The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</description>
