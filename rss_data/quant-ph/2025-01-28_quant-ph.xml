      <title>Radial Uncertainty Product for Spherically Symmetric Potential in Position Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a detailed analysis of the radial uncertainty product for quantum systems with spherically symmetric potentials. Using the principles of quantum mechanics, the study derives the radial uncertainty relation analogous to the Cartesian form and investigates its implications for three key spherically symmetric potentials: the Hydrogen atom, the infinite spherical potential well, and the spherical harmonic oscillator, all within the non-relativistic regime. Employing the Schrodinger equation in spherical coordinates, the paper rigorously evaluates the normalized radial wave functions, expectation values, and uncertainties associated with both position and momentum. Analytical derivations and numerical computations highlight the dependence of the uncertainty product on quantum numbers and system-specific parameters.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic-influenced Floquet-engineering: State preparation, annealing and learning the adiabatic gauge potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving, which enforces adiabatic evolution in arbitrary timescales, can be realised by engineering a Floquet Hamiltonian which oscillates between the Hamiltonian and its derivative requiring no additional control terms. However, the coefficients of the Floquet Hamiltoinan require knowledge of the counterdiabatic terms, which can be difficult to derive outside of a limited set of examples. We introduce a new hybrid technique for the control of quantum systems, Counterdiabatic-influenced Floquet-engineering or CAFFEINE for short. CAFFEINE parameterises the Floquet Hamiltonian for counterdiabatic driving and utilises numerical quantum optimal control in order to obtain the desired target state. This removes the need to both obtain and implement counterdiabatic terms, however, it does require the ability to quickly oscillate each term in the Hamiltonian. If this oscillation is possible, then CAFFEINE provides a framework to implement quantum annealing protocols and general quantum state preparation. We illustrate this through optimisation of two numerical examples of preparing a Bell state with two qubits and performing annealing protocols for the one-dimensional Ising model. Beyond this, we also illustrate CAFFEINE's capabilities to learn the counterdiabatic terms, which can potentially be used as a probe of quantum chaos and the geometry of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry in nonlinear and linear Quantum Optics: the Kerr-like and multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to analyze a rather vast counter-rotating Hamiltonian interaction in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. The method relies upon the supersymmetric mapping of the corresponding rotating interaction and allows the analysis of the dynamics in the counter-rotating system in a fully general and exact analytical manner. Intriguing features of the counter-rotating system are revealed through the simple supersymmetric transformation. In turn, such interesting attributes have an important range of potential technological applications. In this way, supersymmetry emerges as a useful tool to both connect and construct exactly solvable photonic systems in cavity quantum electrodynamics, and more generally in quantum optics, as well as to analyze the corresponding physical consequences and their possible technology implementations.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Effects in Thin Dielectric Layers: Long-Range Dicke Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization and control of collective effects in quantum emitter ensembles have predominantly focused on small, ordered systems, leaving their extension to larger, more complex configurations as a significant challenge. Quantum photonic platforms, with their engineered Green's functions and integration of advanced solid-state quantum emitters, provide opportunities to explore new regimes of light-matter interaction beyond the scope of atomic systems. In this study, we examine the interaction of quantum emitters embedded within a thin dielectric layer. Our results reveal that the guided optical modes of the dielectric layer mediate extended-range interactions between emitters, enabling both total and directional superradiance in arrays spanning several wavelengths. Additionally, the extended interaction range facilitated by the dielectric layer supports Dicke superradiance in regimes where collective effects cannot be obtained in a homogeneous environment. This work uncovers a distinctive interplay between environmental dimensionality and collective quantum dynamics, paving the way for exploring novel many-body quantum optical phenomena in engineered photonic environments.</description>

      <title>Mode Distinguishability in Multi-photon Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is a quintessential process in various quantum information technologies and quantum optics applications. In this work, we investigate multi-photon interference, developing a model for the simultaneous characterization of polarization and spectro-temporal mode mismatch on the coincidence probabilities including the effects of realistic imperfections of devices used in HOM experiments. We also study the coincidence probability for coherent states as a function of source intensity, as well as spectro-temporal and polarization mismatch of the incident beams. We apply our model to the case of multi-photon interference from independent sources and analyze the consequences of mode mismatch in various instances that occur in quantum networking including entanglement swapping, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, quantum optical classification, and photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quantum Circuit Partitioning Across Multiple Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of scaling quantum computing by employing distributed quantum algorithms across multiple processors. We propose a novel circuit partitioning method that leverages graph partitioning to optimize both qubit and gate teleportation, minimizing the required Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs for executing general quantum circuits. Additionally, we formulate an integer linear program to further reduce entanglement requirements by mapping the logical resources of partitioned circuits to the physical constraints of the quantum network. Finally, we analyze the entanglement cost of implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) across multiple QPUs, exploiting the circuit's structure to minimize total entanglement consumption.</description>

      <title>Qubit operations using a modular optical system engineered with PyOpticL: a code-to-CAD optical layout tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex optical design is hindered by conventional piecewise setup, which prevents modularization and therefore abstraction of subsystems at the circuit level. This limits multiple fields that require complex optics systems, including quantum computing with atoms and trapped ions, because their optical systems are not scalable. We present an open-source Python library for optical layout (PyOpticL) which uses beam-path simulation and dynamic beam-path routing for quick and easy optical layout by placing optical elements along the beam path without a priori specification, enabling dynamic layouts with automatic routing and connectivity. We use PyOpticL to create modular drop-in optical baseplates for common optical subsystems used in atomic and molecular optics (AMO) experiments including laser sources, frequency and intensity modulation, and locking to an atomic reference for stabilization. We demonstrate this minimal working example of a dynamic full laser system for strontium trapped ions by using it for laser cooling, qubit state detection, and 99.9% fidelity single-qubit gates with 3D printed baseplates. This enables a new paradigm of design abstraction layers for engineering optical systems leveraging modular baseplates, as they can be used for any wavelength in the system and enables scaling up the underlying optical systems for quantum computers. This new open-source hardware and software code-to-CAD library seeks to foster open-source collaborative hardware and systems design across numerous fields of research including AMO physics and quantum computing with neutral atoms and trapped ions.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with Structured Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, an effective two-photon interference phenomenon, is a cornerstone of quantum optics and a key tool for linear optical quantum information processing. While the HOM effect has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally for various photonic quantum states, particularly in the spectral domain, detailed overviews of its behaviour for structured photons -- those with complex spatial profiles -- under arbitrary spatial mode measurement schemes are still lacking. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the HOM effect for structured photons, including an arbitrary mode projection on quantum interference outcomes. The tutorial also provides analytical, closed-form expressions of the HOM visibility under different measurement conditions, which is a crucial contribution for its application in computational and artificial-intelligence-driven discovery of new quantum experiments exploiting the power of photons with complex spatial modes.</description>

      <title>Origin of performance enhancement of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors by He-ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement for Quantum Chemistry on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is among the most promising applications of quantum computing, offering the potential to solve complex electronic structure problems more efficiently than classical approaches. A critical component of any quantum algorithm is the measurement step, where the desired properties are extracted from a quantum computer. This review focuses on recent advancements in quantum measurement techniques tailored for quantum chemistry, particularly within the second quantized framework suitable for current and near-term quantum hardware.
  We provide a comprehensive overview of measurement strategies developed primarily for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its derivatives. These strategies address the inherent challenges posed by complexity of the electronic Hamiltonian operator. Additionally, we examine methods for estimating excited states and one- and two-electron properties, extending the applicability of quantum algorithms to broader chemical phenomena.
  Key aspects of the review include approaches for constructing measurement operators with reduced classical preprocessing and quantum implementation costs, techniques to minimize the number of measurements required for a given accuracy, and error mitigation strategies that leverage symmetries and other properties of the measurement operators. Furthermore, we explore measurement schemes rooted in Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which are expected to become viable with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computing.
  This review emphasizes foundational concepts and methodologies rather than numerical benchmarks, serving as a resource for researchers aiming to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum measurements in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits, caused by loss mechanisms like material imperfections and two-level system (TLS) defects, remains a major obstacle to improving the performance of quantum devices. In this work, we present atomic-level characterization of cross-sections of a Josephson junction and a spiral resonator to assess the quality of critical interfaces. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we identify structural imperfections associated with oxide layer formation and carbon-based contamination, and correlate these imperfections to the pattering and etching steps in the fabrication process and environmental exposure. These results help to understand that TLS imperfections at critical interfaces play a key role in limiting device performance, emphasizing the need for an improved fabrication process.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Matrix Operations Based on Unitary Transformations and Ancillary State Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix operations are of great significance in quantum computing, which manipulate quantum states in information processing. This paper presents quantum algorithms for several important matrix operations. By leveraging multi-qubit Toffoli gates and basic single-qubit operations, these algorithms efficiently carry out matrix row addition, row swapping, trace calculation and transpose. By using the ancillary measurement techniques to eliminate redundant information, these algorithms achieve streamlined and efficient computations, and demonstrate excellent performance with the running time increasing logarithmically as the matrix dimension grows, ensuring scalability. The success probability depends on the matrix dimensions for the trace calculation, and on the matrix elements for row addition. Interestingly, the success probability is a constant for matrix row swapping and transpose, highlighting the reliability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Finite and Asymptotic Key Analysis for CubeSat-Based BB84 QKD with Elliptical Beam Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite and CubeSat-based quantum key distribution (QKD) presents a promising solution for secure long-distance communication by transmitting quantum keys through free space, with CubeSats offering a compact, cost-effective, and scalable platform for deployment. This study investigates the performance of statistical techniques used to compute the finite-block and single-pass secret key lengths (SKL) for weak coherent pulse (WCP)-based efficient BB84 and standard decoy-state BB84 protocols in CubeSat-based systems. An asymptotic key rate analysis is also conducted for both protocols, providing deeper insights into their theoretical performance within the CubeSat context. The channel transmittance is modeled using an elliptical beam approximation, and the key rate performance is evaluated under varying weather conditions for the downlink scenario. The results demonstrate that the efficient BB84 protocol consistently outperforms the standard version across different atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, the probability distribution of key rates (PDR) for both implementations is analyzed, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their practical effectiveness in CubeSat-based QKD applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting three-dimensional chaotic systems with four qubit quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is among the most promising approaches for AI-based prediction models of complex systems. It combines superior prediction performance with very low CPU-needs for training. Recent results demonstrated that quantum systems are also well-suited as reservoirs in RC. Due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension obtained by increasing the number of quantum elements small quantum systems are already sufficient for time series prediction. Here, we demonstrate that three-dimensional systems can already well be predicted by quantum reservoir computing with a quantum reservoir consisting of the minimal number of qubits necessary for this task, namely four. This is achieved by optimizing the encoding of the data, using spatial and temporal multiplexing and recently developed read-out-schemes that also involve higher exponents of the reservoir response. We outline, test and validate our approach using eight prototypical three-dimensional chaotic systems. Both, the short-term prediction and the reproduction of the long-term system behavior (the system's "climate") are feasible with the same setup of optimized hyperparameters. Our results may be a further step towards the realization of a dedicated small quantum computer for prediction tasks in the NISQ-era.</description>

      <title>Ion-Trap Chip Architecture Optimized for Implementation of Quantum Error-Correcting Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new ion-trap architecture optimized for the efficient execution of both transversal and non-transversal gate operations in a two-dimensional color code. By differentiating the regions for transversal gates from those for non-transversal gates and syndrome extraction, which require distinct qubit connectivities, our chip layout minimizes ion shuttling and simplifies physical implementations. We also provide a dedicated transpiler and scheduler for this architecture, wherein the scheduler coordinates the sequence of operations and inserts the necessary swap and shuttling operations. Finally, we developed an error analyzer to evaluate the chip's performance across a variety of quantum algorithms. Simulation results confirm that our architecture can significantly increase success rates and reduce gate error probabilities, particularly lowering the effective two-qubit gate error probability to about 10^{-8} when a quantum error-correcting code of 31 physical qubits is employed. Our findings clearly show that the improvement in success rates clearly outweighs the runtime overhead, demonstrating that strategic hardware-scheduler co-design can advance quantum systems towards reliable, large-scale computing, potentially surpassing classical capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem seeks to minimize the total transportation cost between two distributions, thus providing a measure of distance between them. In this work, we study the optimal transport of the eigenspectrum of one-dimensional non-Hermitian models as the spectrum deforms on the complex plane under a varying imaginary gauge field. Notably, according to the non-Bloch band theory, the deforming spectrum continuously connects the eigenspectra of the original non-Hermitian model (with vanishing gauge field) under different boundary conditions. It follows that the optimal spectral transport should contain key information of the model. Characterizing the optimal spectral transport through the Wasserstein metric, we show that, indeed, important features of the non-Hermitian model, such as the (auxiliary) generalized Brillouin zone, the non-Bloch exceptional point, and topological phase transition, can be determined from the Wasserstein-metric calculation. We confirm our conclusions using concrete examples. Our work highlights the key role of spectral geometry in non-Hermitian physics, and offers a practical and convenient access to the properties of non-Hermitian models.</description>

      <title>Construction of new type of CNOT gate using cross-resonance pulse in the transmon-PPQ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmon, known for its fast operation time and the coherence time of tens of microseconds, is the most commonly used qubit for superconducting quantum processors. However, it is still necessary to enhance the coherence time and the gate fidelity of superconducting quantum processors for the practical implementation of fault-tolerant quantum computing. Meanwhile, a novel superconducting qubit, which has the ability to protect the Cooper-pair parity on the superconducting island, has been proposed. This new qubit shows better coherence performance than the transmon, but it does not yet have an efficient method for realizing a superconducting hybrid system that harnesses it.
  In this work, we show how to implement a new type of CNOT gate in a superconducting hybrid system composed of tunable transmon and parity-protected qubit by applying a cross-resonance pulse. First, we provide hardware specifications and pulse parameters to construct a successful two-qubit gate in the hybrid system. Second, we show that our method can supply a CNOT gate of average fidelity with more than 0.998. Therefore, our work implies that the hybrid system may provide a new platform for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Chromatic Quantum Contextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic quantum contextuality is a criterion for quantum nonclassicality rooted in the coloring constraints of hypergraphs. By examining the 3-uniform Yu-Oh hypergraph -- a configuration of quantum observables -- we prove its chromatic number exceeds the classical three-color limit. This result establishes chromatic contextuality as a distinct form of quantum nonclassicality, diverging from Kochen-Specker-type arguments that rely on the absence of two-valued states. Crucially, the Yu-Oh hypergraph exhibits this behavior even when separable two-valued states exist, demonstrating that chromatic contextuality operates independently of traditional noncontextuality violations. Our findings underscore hypergraph coloring as a powerful framework for identifying quantum signatures, enriching the understanding of contextuality beyond conventional paradigms.</description>

      <title>Generation of narrowband quantum emitters in hBN with optically addressable spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spins coupled with optical transitions in solids stand out as a promising platform for developing spin-based quantum technologies. Recently, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) - a layered Van der Waals (vdW) crystal, has emerged as a promising host for optically addressable spin systems. However, to date, on-demand generation of isolated single photon emitters with pre-determined spin transitions has remained elusive. Here, we report on a single step, thermal processing of hBN flakes that produces high density, narrowband, quantum emitters with optically active spin transitions. Remarkably, over 25% of the emitters exhibit a clear signature of an optical spin readout at room temperature, surpassing all previously reported results by an order of magnitude. The generated spin defect complexes exhibit both S = 1 and S = 1/2 transitions, which are explained by charge transfer from strongly to weakly coupled spin pairs. Our work advances the understanding of spin complexes in hBN and paves the way for single spin - photon interfaces in layered vdW materials with applications in quantum sensing and information processing.</description>

      <title>Neural quantum embedding via deterministic quantum computation with one qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is expected to provide exponential speedup in machine learning. However, optimizing the data loading process, commonly referred to as quantum data embedding, to maximize classification performance remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a neural quantum embedding (NQE) technique based on deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1). Unlike the traditional embedding approach, NQE trains a neural network to maximize the trace distance between quantum states corresponding to different categories of classical data. Furthermore, training is efficiently achieved using DQC1, which is specifically designed for ensemble quantum systems, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We validate the NQE-DQC1 protocol by encoding handwritten images into NMR quantum processors, demonstrating a significant improvement in distinguishability compared to traditional methods. Additionally, after training the NQE, we implement a parameterized quantum circuit for classification tasks, achieving 98\% classification accuracy, in contrast to the 54\% accuracy obtained using traditional embedding. Moreover, we show that the NQE-DQC1 protocol is extendable, enabling the use of the NMR system for NQE training due to its high compatibility with DQC1, while subsequent machine learning tasks can be performed on other physical platforms, such as superconducting circuits. Our work opens new avenues for utilizing ensemble quantum systems for efficient classical data embedding into quantum registers.</description>

      <title>Certifying entanglement dimensionality by reduction moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we combine the k-reduction map, the moment method, and the classical shadow method into a practical protocol for certifying the entanglement dimensionality. Our approach is based on the observation that a state with entanglement dimensionality at most k must stay positive under the action of the k-reduction map. The core of our protocol utilizes the moment method to determine whether the k-reduced operator, i.e., the operator obtained after applying the k-reduction map on a quantum state, contains negative eigenvalues or not. Notably, we propose a systematic method for constructing reduction moment criteria, which apply to a much wider range of states than fidelity-based methods. The performance of our approach gets better and better with the moment order employed, which is corroborated by extensive numerical simulation. To apply our approach, it suffices to implement a unitary 3-design instead of a 4-design, which is more feasible in practice than the correlation matrix method. In the course of study, we show that the k-reduction negativity, the absolute sum of the negative eigenvalues of the k-reduced operator, is monotonic under local operations and classical communication for pure states.</description>

      <title>Flexible generation of optomagnonic quantum entanglement and quantum coherence difference in double-cavity-optomagnomechanical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum coherence generated from the optomagnomechanical system are important resources in quantum information and quantum computation. In this paper, a scheme for flexibly generating optomagnonic quantum entanglement and quantum coherence difference is proposed, based on a double-cavity-optomagnomechanical system. The parameter dependencies of the bipartite optomagnonic entanglement, the genuine tripartite optomagnonic entanglement, the quantum coherence difference, and the stability of the system, are investigated intensively. The results show that this scheme endows the magnon more flexibility to choose different mechanisms, under the condition of maintaining the system stable. This work is valuable for connecting different nodes in quantum networks and manipulating the magnon states with light in the future.</description>

      <title>QuESat: Satellite-Assisted Quantum Internet for Global-Scale Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution across remote distances is critical for many quantum applications. Currently, the de facto approach for remote entanglement distribution relies on optical fiber for on-the-ground entanglement distribution. However, the fiber-based approach is incapable of global-scale entanglement distribution due to intrinsic limitations. This paper investigates a new hybrid ground-satellite quantum network architecture (QuESat) for global-scale entanglement distribution, integrating an on-the-ground fiber network with a global-scale passive optical network built with low-Earth-orbit satellites. The satellite network provides dynamic construction of photon lightpaths based on near-vacuum beam guides constructed via adjustable arrays of lenses, forwarding photons from one ground station to another with very high efficiency over long distances compared to using fiber. To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of QuESat for global communication, we formulate lightpath provisioning and entanglement distribution problems, considering the orbital dynamics of satellites and the time-varying entanglement demands from ground users. A two-stage algorithm is developed to dynamically configure the beam guides and distribute entanglements, respectively. The algorithm combines randomized and deterministic rounding for lightpath provisioning to enable global connectivity, with optimal entanglement swapping for distributing entanglements to meet users' demands. By developing a ground-satellite quantum network simulator, QuESat achieves multi-fold improvements compared to repeater networks.</description>

Abstract: A new type of link between geometry of symplectic group and entanglement-assisted (EA) quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) is presented. Relations of symplectic subspaces and quaternary additive codes concerning parameters of EAQECCs are described. Thus, parameters of EA stabilizer codes are revealed in the nomenclature of additive codes. Our techniques enable us solve some open problems about optimal EAQECCs and entanglement-assisted quantum minimum distance separable (EAQMDS) codes, and are also useful for designing encoding and decoding quantum circuit of EA stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>A maximum concurrence criterion to investigate absolutely maximally entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward method to determine the maximal entanglement of pure states using the criterion of maximal I-concurrence, a measure of entanglement. The square of concurrence for a bipartition $X|X^\prime$ of a pure state is defined as $E^2_{X| X ^\prime}=2[1-tr({\rho_X}^2)]$. From this, we can infer that the concurrence $E_{X| X ^\prime}$ reaches its maximum when $tr({\rho_X}^2)$ is minimized. Using this approach, we identify numerous Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) pure states that exhibit maximal entanglement across all possible bipartitions. Conditions are derived for pure states to achieve maximal mixedness in all bipartitions, revealing that any pure state with an odd number of subsystem coefficients does not meet the AME criterion. Furthermore, we obtain equal maximal multipartite entangled pure states across all bipartitions using our maximal concurrence criterion.</description>

      <title>Imperfection analyses for random-telegraph-noise mitigation using spectator qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectator qubits (SQs) for random-telegraph noise mitigation have been proposed by Song et al., Phys. Rev. A, 107, L030601 (2023), where an SQ operates as a noise probe to estimate optimal noise-correction control on the hard-to-access data qubits. It was shown that a protocol with adaptive measurement on the SQs and a Bayesian estimation-based control can suppress the data qubits' decoherence rate by a large factor with quadratic scaling in the SQ sensitivity. However, the protocol's practicality in real-world scenarios remained in question, due to various sources of imperfection that could affect the performance. We therefore analyze here the proposed adaptive protocol under non-ideal conditions, including parameter uncertainties in the system, efficiency and time delay in readout and reset processes of the SQs, and additional decoherence on the SQs. We also explore analytical methods of Bayesian estimation in the time domain and generalize the map-based formalism to non-ideal scenarios. This allows us to derive imperfection bounds at which the decoherence suppression remains approximately the same as under ideal conditions.</description>

      <title>Expressive Limits of Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using physical systems as the resource for computation in reservoir computing has two prominent reasons: the high dimensional state space and its intrinsic non-linear dynamics. Quantum systems specifically promise even further improvements to their classical pendants, offering an exponentially scaling state space with respect to the system size. How this scaling reflects in the actual performance of the quantum mechanical reservoir computer remains, however, unclear. Using methods from the field of parameterized quantum cirucits, we show that the expressive power of a quantum reservoir computer is limited by the way the input is injected. In particular, injecting the input via single qubit rotations, we give an upper bound for the maximum number of orthogonal functions the system can express. We find that, contrary to the intuitive expectation, increasing the complexity of the reservoir does not necessarily increase its expressivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite and multipartite quantum steerings are significant resources for various quantum tasks, such as ultrasecure multi-user quantum network, one-site-trusted quantum communication, high-fidelity quantum computation, etc. A flexible steering manipulation scheme of five down-converted Hermitian Gaussian modes generated from an optical parametric oscillator by using a spatial structured pump is presented. In our scheme, not only the direction and types of the bipartite steering, but also different situations of multipartite steering, can be manipulated effectively, by adjusting the pump proportions with a spatial light modulator. In addition, stricter genuine pentapartite steering (only one site is trusted) can also be achieved by making the pump proportions as balanced as possible. Our scheme is versatile and experimentally feasible and offers new insights into the manipulation of steering, especially multipartite steering, which is valuable in many special quantum tasks.</description>

      <title>Connection between memory performance and optical absorption in quantum reservoir computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fading memory property is a key requirement for reservoir computers -- a specific type of recurrent neural network with fixed internal weights. While mostly undesired in gate-based quantum computing, dissipation due to material imperfections or coupling to the environment acts as a natural mechanism intrinsically providing fading memory to reservoir computers based on dynamical open quantum systems. In this work, we unravel a connection between the physical metric of optical absorption and the performance of quantum reservoir computers in terms of their short-term memory capacity. We establish this link by considering a coherent input encoding in conjunction with tunable qubit decay, giving precise control over the fading memory in the quantum reservoir computer. Our analysis enables us to identify a sweet-spot regime for the dissipation strength at which memory performance is maximized.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional chains of atoms can be effectively described by one-dimensional Dirac-type equation. Crystal structure of the chain is reflected by pseudo-spin of the quasi-particles. In the article, we present a simple framework where supersymmetric transformation is utilized to generate an interaction between two, initially non-interacting systems described by pseudo-spin-one Dirac-type equation. In the presented example, the transformation converts two asymptotically non-interacting atomic chains into a saw chain locally. The model possesses a flat band whose energy can be fine-tuned deliberately.</description>

Our approach modifies an existing quantum pre-conditioning method (different from classical methods) for the problem of Asian option pricing such that we remove the dependence on the original condition number of discretized differential equation (system of linear equations). This was possible with new fast-forwardable discretizations of the first and second derivatives with respect to the underlying asset value ratio (value over average). We determine that these discretizations handle well kinks in the initial/terminal conditions. We also introduce a new circuit construction for the discretized time-derivative operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions which avoids the oracle workspace needed for the general sparse matrix implementation. Here, we also devised a new method probability integral estimation from which we extract the solution, achieving $\tilde{O}({\rm polylog}\left(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is an exponential improvement over other quantum methods when it comes to solution information extraction from the solution state.</description>

      <title>On-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing light from solid-state single-photon sources with scalable and robust room-temperature quantum memories has been a long-standing challenge in photonic quantum information technologies due to inherent noise processes and time-scale mismatches between the operating conditions of solid-state and atomic systems. Here, we demonstrate on-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot device in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory. A deterministically fabricated InGaAs quantum dot light source emits single photons at the wavelength of the cesium D1 line at 895\,nm which exhibit an inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of 5.1(7)\,GHz and are subsequently stored in a low-noise ladder-type cesium vapor memory. We show control over the interaction between the single photons and the atomic vapor, allowing for variable retrieval times of up to 19.8(3)\,ns at an internal efficiency of $\eta_\mathrm{int}=0.6(1)\%$. Our results significantly expand the application space of both room-temperature vapor memories and semiconductor quantum dots in future quantum network architectures.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Sensing with Bipartite Entanglement over Bosonic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a joint communication and sensing problem in an optical link in which a low-power transmitter attempts to communicate with a receiver while simultaneously identifying the range of a defect creating a backscattered signal. We model the system as a lossy thermal noise bosonic channel in which the location of the target, modeled as a beamsplitter, affects the timing of the backscattered signal. Motivated by the envisioned deployment of entanglement sharing quantum networks, we allow the transmitter to exploit entanglement to assist its sensing and communication. Since entanglement is known to enhance sensing, as known from quantum illumination, and increase communication rates, as known from the characterization of the entanglement-assisted capacity, the transmitter is faced with a trade-off and must judiciously allocate its entanglement resources. Our main result is a characterization of the trade-offs incurred in the form of an achievable rate/error-exponent region which can beat time-sharing in certain cases. The proof of our result relies on technical results of independent interests, by which we carefully show how to extend the known asymptotic characterization of multi-hypothesis testing Chernoff exponent in finite-dimensional spaces to infinite-dimensional spaces and provide a characterization of phase shift keying modulated displaced thermal states in Fock basis.</description>

      <title>Advancing quantum imaging through learning theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify performance of quantum imaging by modeling it as a learning task and calculating the Resolvable Expressive Capacity (REC). Compared to the traditionally applied Fisher information matrix approach, REC provides a single-parameter interpretation of overall imaging quality for specific measurements that applies in the regime of finite samples. We first examine imaging performance for two-point sources and generally distributed sources, referred to as compact sources, both of which have intensity distributions confined within the Rayleigh limit of the imaging system. Our findings indicate that REC increases stepwise as the sample number reaches certain thresholds, which are dependent on the source's size. Notably, these thresholds differ between direct imaging and superresolution measurements (e.g., spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) measurement in the case of Gaussian point spread functions (PSF)). REC also enables the extension of our analysis to more general scenarios involving multiple compact sources, beyond the previously studied scenarios. For closely spaced compact sources with Gaussian PSFs, our newly introduced orthogonalized SPADE method outperforms the naively separate SPADE method, as quantified by REC.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement to Bonds: Chemical Bonding Concepts from Quantum Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical bonding is a nonlocal phenomenon that binds atoms into molecules. Its ubiquitous presence in chemistry, however, stands in stark contrast to its ambiguous definition and the lack of a universal perspective for its understanding. In this work, we rationalize and characterize chemical bonding through the lens of an equally nonlocal concept from quantum information, the orbital entanglement. We introduce maximally entangled atomic orbitals (MEAOs) whose entanglement pattern is shown to recover both Lewis (two-center) and beyond-Lewis (multicenter) structures, with multipartite entanglement serving as a comprehensive index of bond strength. Our unifying framework for bonding analyses is effective not only for equilibrium geometries but also for transition states in chemical reactions and complex phenomena such as aromaticity. It also has the potential to elevate the Hilbert space atomic partitioning to match the prevalent real-space partitioning in the theory of atoms in molecules. Accordingly, our work opens new pathways for understanding fuzzy chemical concepts using rigorous, quantitative descriptors from quantum information.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of sensitivity near exceptional points in dissipative qubit-resonator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation usually plays a negative role in quantum metrological technologies, which aim to improve measurement precision by leveraging quantum effects that are vulnerable to environment-induced decoherence. Recently, it has been demonstrated that dissipation can actually be used as a favorable resource for enhancing the susceptibility of signal detection. However, demonstrations of such enhancement for detecting physical quantities in open quantum systems are still lacking. Here we propose and demonstrate a protocol for realizing such non-Hermitian quantum sensors for probing the coupling between a qubit and a resonator subjecting to energy dissipations. The excitation-number conversion associated with the no-jump evolution trajectory enables removal of the noisy outcomes with quantum jumps, implementing the exceptional point (EP), where the Rabi splitting exhibits a divergent behavior in response to a tiny variation of the effective coupling. The sensitivity enhancement near the EP is confirmed by both theoretical calculation and experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Nexus of Many-Body Theories through Neural Network Techniques: the Tangent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a physically informed neural network representation of the effective interactions associated with coupled-cluster downfolding models to describe chemical systems and processes. The neural network representation not only allows us to evaluate the effective interactions efficiently for various geometrical configurations of chemical systems corresponding to various levels of complexity of the underlying wave functions, but also reveals that the bare and effective interactions are related by a tangent function of some latent variables. We refer to this characterization of the effective interaction as a tangent model. We discuss the connection between this tangent model for the effective interaction with the previously developed theoretical analysis that examines the difference between the bare and effective Hamiltonians in the corresponding active spaces.</description>

      <title>Limits on broadcasting non-stabilizerness through unrestricted operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the resource theory of non-stabilizerness, we prove that stabilizer operations cannot replicate or broadcast the "magic" resource of all quantum states in an arbitrary finite dimension. Moreover, we show that even in unrestricted scenarios, there are fundamental limits on cloning the non-stabilizerness content of quantum states. When using an auxiliary system as part of the cloning process, we show that it is impossible to broadcast the non-stabilizerness of qubits that possess a greater degree of non-stabilizerness than the known states on which the transformations are based. We also derive the conditions to broadcast magic perfectly using unrestricted operations. Furthermore, we compare non-stabilizerness broadcasting with traditional state cloning methods, such as state-dependent and -independent cloners, which can achieve perfect broadcasting of states with known magic content. Our findings reveal that state-dependent cloning unitaries designed for specific states have lower average non-stabilizerness-generating power than magic-generating unitaries.</description>

      <title>No-Go Theorem for Generic Simulation of Qubit Channels with Finite Classical Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical framework of quantum theory, though fundamentally distinct from classical physics, raises the question of whether quantum processes can be efficiently simulated using classical resources. For instance, a sender (Alice) possessing the classical description of a qubit state can simulate the action of a qubit channel through finite classical communication with a receiver (Bob), enabling Bob to reproduce measurement statistics for any observable on the state. Here, we contend that a more general simulation requires reproducing statistics of joint measurements, potentially involving entangled effects, on Alice's system and an additional system held by Bob, even when Bob's system state is unknown or entangled with a larger system. We establish a no-go result, demonstrating that such a general simulation for the perfect qubit channel is impossible with finite classical communication. Furthermore, we show that entangled effects render classical simulation significantly more challenging compared to unentangled effects. On the other hand, for noisy qubit channels, such as those with depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that general simulation is achievable with finite communication. Notably, the required communication increases as the noise decreases, revealing an intricate relationship between the noise in the channel and the resources necessary for its classical simulation.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Knowledge through Reverse Annealing: A Preliminary Analysis of the Benefits and What to Share</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being immersed in the NISQ-era, current quantum annealers present limitations for solving optimization problems efficiently. To mitigate these limitations, D-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called Reverse Annealing, a specific type of quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found elsewhere. Despite the research activity around Reverse Annealing, none has theorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge under this paradigm. This work moves in that direction and is driven by experimentation focused on answering two key research questions: i) is reverse annealing a paradigm that can benefit from knowledge transfer between similar problems? and ii) can we infer the characteristics that an input solution should meet to help increase the probability of success? To properly guide the tests in this paper, the well-known Knapsack Problem has been chosen for benchmarking purposes, using a total of 34 instances composed of 14 and 16 items.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking and establishing proper statistical validation metrics for reinforcement learning (RL) remain ongoing challenges, where no consensus has been established yet. The emergence of quantum computing and its potential applications in quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) further complicate benchmarking efforts. To enable valid performance comparisons and to streamline current research in this area, we propose a novel benchmarking methodology, which is based on a statistical estimator for sample complexity and a definition of statistical outperformance. Furthermore, considering QRL, our methodology casts doubt on some previous claims regarding its superiority. We conducted experiments on a novel benchmarking environment with flexible levels of complexity. While we still identify possible advantages, our findings are more nuanced overall. We discuss the potential limitations of these results and explore their implications for empirical research on quantum advantage in QRL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems faster than classical computers by exploiting quantum mechanical effects such as superposition. However, building high-quality quantum software is challenging due to the fundamental differences between quantum and traditional programming and the lack of abstraction mechanisms. To mitigate this challenge, researchers have introduced quantum patterns to capture common high-level design solutions to recurring problems in quantum software engineering. In order to utilize patterns as an abstraction level for implementation, a mapping between the theoretical patterns and the source code is required, which has only been addressed to a limited extent. To close this gap, we propose a framework for the automatic detection of quantum patterns using state- and circuit-based code analysis. Furthermore, we contribute a dataset for benchmarking quantum pattern detection approaches. In an empirical evaluation, we show that our framework is able to detect quantum patterns very accurately and that it outperforms existing quantum pattern detection approaches in terms of detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Harnessing CUDA-Q's MPS for Tensor Network Simulations of Large-Scale Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computer simulators are an indispensable tool for prototyping quantum algorithms and verifying the functioning of existing quantum computer hardware. The current largest quantum computers feature more than one thousand qubits, challenging their classical simulators. State-vector quantum simulators are challenged by the exponential increase of representable quantum states with respect to the number of qubits, making more than fifty qubits practically unfeasible. A more appealing approach for simulating quantum computers is adopting the tensor network approach, whose memory requirements fundamentally depend on the level of entanglement in the quantum circuit, and allows simulating the current largest quantum computers. This work investigates and evaluates the CUDA-Q tensor network simulators on an Nvidia Grace Hopper system, particularly the Matrix Product State (MPS) formulation. We compare the performance of the CUDA-Q state vector implementation and validate the correctness of MPS simulations. Our results highlight that tensor network-based methods provide a significant opportunity to simulate large-qubit circuits, albeit approximately. We also show that current GPU-accelerated computation cannot fully utilize GPU efficiently in the case of MPS simulations.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference from an InAs Quantum Dot emitting in the Telecom C-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Quantum Many-body Chaos in Non-Hermitian Quantum Spin Chain via Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase transitions from chaotic to non-chaotic dynamics in a quantum spin chain with a local non-Hermitian disorder, which can be realized with a Rydberg atom array setting. As the disorder strength increases, the emergence of non-chaotic dynamics is qualitatively captured through the suppressed growth of Krylov complexity, and quantitatively identified through the reciprocity breaking of Krylov space. We further find that the localization in Krylov space generates another transition in the weak disorder regime, suggesting a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results closely align with conventional methods, such as the entanglement entropy and complex level spacing statistics, and pave the way to explore non-Hermitian phase transitions using Krylov complexity and associated metrics.</description>

      <title>A Retrodictive Approach to Quantum State Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smoothing is a technique for estimating the state of an imperfectly monitored open system by combining both prior and posterior measurement information. In the quantum regime, current approaches to smoothing either give unphysical outcomes, due to the non-commutativity of the measurements at different times, or require assumptions about how the environment is measuring the system, which with current technology is unverifiable. We propose a novel definition of the smoothed quantum state based on quantum Bayesian retrodiction, which mirrors the classical retrodictive approach to smoothing. This approach always yields physical results and does not require any assumption on the environment. We show that this smoothed state has, on average, greater purity than the state reconstructed using just the prior information. Finally, we make a connection with the smoothing theory of Guevara and Wiseman in a well-studied regime, and describe from a purely quantum perspective how it conditions on the posterior information.</description>

      <title>Incoherent? No, Just Decoherent: How Quantum Many Worlds Emerge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics describes an emergent multiverse. The goal of this paper is to provide a perspicuous characterisation of how the multiverse emerges making use of a recent account of (weak) ontological emergence. This will be cashed out with a case study that identifies decoherence as the mechanism for emergence. The greater metaphysical clarity enables the rebuttal of critiques due to Baker (2007) and Dawid and Th\'ebault (2015) that cast the emergent multiverse ontology as incoherent; responses are also offered to challenges to the Everettian approach from Maudlin (2010) and Monton (2013).</description>

Abstract: Information inequalities govern the ultimate limitations in information theory and as such play an pivotal role in characterizing what values the entropy of multipartite states can take. Proving an information inequality, however, quickly becomes arduous when the number of involved parties increases. For classical systems, [Yeung, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory (1997)] proposed a framework to prove Shannon-type inequalities via linear programming. Here, we derive an analogous framework for quantum systems, based on the strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity inequalities for the von-Neumann entropy. Importantly, this also allows us to handle constrained inequalities, which - in the classical case - served as a crucial tool in proving the existence of non-standard, so-called non-Shannon-type inequalities [Zhang &amp; Yeung, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory (1998)]. Our main contribution is the Python package qITIP, for which we present the theory and demonstrate its capabilities with several illustrative examples</description>

      <title>Remarks on controlled measurement and quantum algorithm for calculating Hermitian conjugate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new aspects for the recently proposed algorithms for matrix manipulating based on the special encoding the matrix elements into the superposition state of a quantum system. First aspect is the controlled measurement which allows to avoid the problem of small access probability to the required ancilla state at the final step of algorithms needed to remove the garbage of the states. Application of controlled measurement to the earlier developed algorithm is demonstrated. The second aspect is the algorithm for calculating the Hermitian conjugate of an arbitrary matrix, which supplements the algorithms proposed earlier. The appropriate circuits are presented.</description>

      <title>How to Design a Classically Difficult Random Quantum Circuit for Quantum Computational Advantage Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computational advantage is a critical milestone for near-term quantum technologies and an essential step towards building practical quantum computers. Recent successful demonstrations of quantum computational advantage owe much to specifically designed random quantum circuit (RQC) protocols that enable hardware-friendly implementation and, more importantly, pose great challenges for classical simulation. Here, we report the automated protocol design approach used for finding the optimal RQC in the \textit{Zuchongzhi} quantum computational advantage experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127 (18), 180501 (2021)]. Without a carefully designed protocol, the classical simulation cost of the \textit{Zuchongzhi}'s 56-qubit 20-cycle RQC experiment would not be considerably higher than Google's 53-qubit 20-cycle experiment, even though more qubits are involved. For Google's latest RQC experiment using $70$ qubits and $24$ cycles [arXiv:2304.11119 (2023)], we estimate that its classical simulation cost can be increased by at least one order of magnitude using our approach. The proposed method can be applied to generic planar quantum processor architectures and addresses realistic imperfections such as processor defects, underpinning quantum computational advantage experiments in future generations of quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve quantum many-body problem by propagating ensembles of trajectories and guiding waves in physical space. We introduce the 'effective potential' correction within the recently proposed time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo methodology to incorporate the nonlocal quantum correlation effects between the electrons. The associated correlation length is calculated by adaptive kernel density estimation over the walker distribution. The general formalism is developed and tested on one-dimensional Helium atom in laser field of different intensity and carrier frequency. Good agreement with exact results for the atomic ionization is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum binary field multiplication with subquadratic Toffoli gate count and low space-time cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplication over binary fields is a crucial operation in quantum algorithms designed to solve the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic curve defined over $GF(2^n)$. In this paper, we present an algorithm for constructing quantum circuits that perform multiplication over $GF(2^n)$ with $\mathcal{O}(n^{\log_2(3)})$ Toffoli gates. We propose a variant of our construction that achieves linear depth by using $\mathcal{O}(n\log_2(n))$ ancillary qubits. This approach provides the best known space-time trade-off for binary field multiplication with a subquadratic number of Toffoli gates. Additionally, we demonstrate that for some particular families of primitive polynomials, such as trinomials, the multiplication can be done in logarithmic depth and with $\mathcal{O}(n^{\log_2(3)})$ gates.</description>

      <title>State Permutation Control in Non-Hermitian Multiqubit Systems with Suppressed Non-Adiabatic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have been at the focus of intense research for over a decade, partly due to their nontrivial energy topology formed by intersecting Riemann manifolds with branch points known as exceptional points (EPs). This spectral property can be exploited, e.g., to achieve controlled state permutations that are necessary for implementing a wide class of classical and quantum information protocols. However, the imaginary spectra of typical non-Hermitian systems lead to instabilities and breakdown of adiabaticity, which impedes the practical use of EP-induced energy topologies in quantum information protocols that explicitly rely on symmetric state flips. On the other hand, techniques that help to suppress non-adiabatic transitions in non-Hermitian systems have also been developed, but these advances have so far been limited to single qubits. In this work, we address this long-standing problem by introducing a model of interacting qubits governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that hosts EPs and possesses a completely real energy spectrum. We demonstrate that such non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enable realization of permutation groups in the multi-qubit eigenspace. Our findings indicate that, contrary to previous beliefs, non-Hermiticity can be utilized to achieve controlled state permutations in time-modulated multiqubit systems, thus paving the way for the advancement and development of novel quantum information protocols.</description>

      <title>Expediting quantum state transfer through long-range extended XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, reducing the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit. Our study identifies the long-range regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Further, we exhibit that the presence of long-range interactions also improves the achievable fidelity, mitigating its decline associated with increasing system-size.</description>

      <title>Active Hypothesis Testing for Quantum Detection of Phase-Shift Keying Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum detection of Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)-coded coherent states through the lens of active hypothesis testing, focusing on a Dolinar-like receiver with constraints on displacement amplitude and energy. With coherent state slicing, we formulate the problem as a controlled sensing task in which observation kernels have parameters shrinking with sample size. The constrained open-loop error exponent and a corresponding upper bound on the Bayesian error probability are proven. Surprisingly, the exponent-optimal open-loop policy for binary PSK with high dark counts is not simply time-sharing. This work serves as a first step towards obtaining analytical insights through the active hypothesis testing framework for designing resource-constrained quantum communication receivers.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved and Superradiantly Amplified Unruh Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An atom serves as a natural probe of quantum field fluctuations and any modifications to them, as fundamentally manifested in spontaneous emission. A collection of excited atoms can spontaneously develop correlations seeded by the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The correlations build over a finite time period, culminating in an intense, directional emission of photons known as superradiance. For a collection of atoms undergoing uniform linear acceleration, we identify low-acceleration conditions under which the buildup of correlations occurs faster and is driven solely by the modified field fluctuations underlying the Unruh effect - a prediction that a uniformly accelerated observer experiences the inertial vacuum as a thermal state. We demonstrate that these conditions can be realized inside a sub-resonant cavity that highly suppresses the response of an inertial atom, while still allowing significant response from an accelerated atom as, owing to the acceleration-induced spectral broadening, it can still couple to the available field modes. The field fluctuations perceived inertially under the sub-resonant cavity configuration would cause a superradiant burst much later. The early superradiant burst thus emerges as an unambiguous signature of the Unruh effect. In this way, we simultaneously address the extreme acceleration requirement, the weak signal, and the dominance of the inertial signal, all within a single experimental arrangement.</description>

      <title>Optimizer-Dependent Generalization Bound for Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) play a pivotal role in addressing complex tasks within quantum machine learning, analogous to classical neural networks in deep learning. Ensuring consistent performance across diverse datasets is crucial for understanding and optimizing QNNs in both classical and quantum machine learning tasks, but remains a challenge as QNN's generalization properties have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the generalization properties of QNNs through the lens of learning algorithm stability, circumventing the need to explore the entire hypothesis space and providing insights into how classical optimizers influence QNN performance. By establishing a connection between QNNs and quantum combs, we examine the general behaviors of QNN models from a quantum information theory perspective. Leveraging the uniform stability of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, we propose a generalization error bound determined by the number of trainable parameters, data uploading times, dataset dimension, and classical optimizer hyperparameters. Numerical experiments validate this comprehensive understanding of QNNs and align with our theoretical conclusions. As the first exploration into understanding the generalization capability of QNNs from a unified perspective of design and training, our work offers practical insights for applying QNNs in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) in its analog form using a neutral atom quantum processing unit to solve the Maximum Independent Set problem. The analog QAOA leverages the natural encoding of problem Hamiltonians by Rydberg atom interactions, while employing Bayesian Optimisation to navigate the quantum-classical parameter space effectively under the constraints of hardware noise and resource limitations. We evaluate the approach through a combination of simulations and experimental runs on Pasqal's first commercial quantum processing unit, Orion Alpha, demonstrating effective parameter optimisation and noise mitigation strategies, such as selective bitstring discarding and detection error corrections. Results show that a limited number of measurements still allows for a quick convergence to a solution, making it a viable solution for resource-efficient scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Reinforcement Learning with a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) under model-free settings with quantum oracle access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markovian master equations underlie many areas of modern physics and, despite their apparent simplicity, they encode a rich and complex dynamics which is still under active research. We identify a class of continuous variable Markovian master equations for which positivity and complete positivity become equivalent. We apply this result to characterize the positivity of the partially transposed evolution of bipartite Gaussian systems, which encodes the dynamics of entanglement. Finally, the entangling properties of models of classical gravity interacting with quantum matter are investigated in the context of the experimental proposals to detect gravitationally induced entanglement. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. In particular, by focusing on the Di\'osi-Penrose model for two gravitationally interacting masses, we show that entanglement-based experiments would constrain the free parameter of the model $R_0$ up to values six orders of magnitude stronger than the current state of the art.</description>

Abstract: In signal processing, resampling algorithms can modify the number of resources encoding a collection of data points. Downsampling reduces the cost of storage and communication, while upsampling interpolates new data from limited one, e.g. when resizing a digital image. We present a toolset of quantum algorithms to resample data encoded in the probabilities of a quantum register, using the quantum Fourier transform to adjust the number of high-frequency encoding qubits. We discuss advantage over classical resampling algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual excitations, inherent to ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems, induce measurable modifications in system properties, offering a novel resource for quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate how these virtual excitations and their correlations can be harnessed to enhance precision measurements, without the need to extract them. Building on the paradigmatic Dicke model, which describes the interaction between an ensemble of two-level atoms and a single radiation mode, we propose a method to harness hybridized light-matter modes for quantum metrology. Our results not only highlight the potential of virtual excitations to surpass classical precision limits but also extend to a broad range of ultrastrongly coupled systems.</description>

Abstract: Collision models have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their versatility to simulate open quantum systems in different dynamical regimes. They have been used to study various interesting phenomena such as the dynamical emergence of non-Markovian memory effects and the spontaneous establishment of synchronization in open quantum systems. In such models, the repeated pairwise interactions between the system and the environment and also the possible coupling between different environmental units are typically modeled using the coherent partial-swap (PSWAP) operation as it is known to be a universal homogenizer. In this study, we investigate the dynamical behavior of incoherent collision models, where the interactions between different units are modeled by the incoherent controlled-swap (CSWAP) operation, which is also a universal homogenizer. Even though the asymptotic dynamics of the open system in case of both coherent and incoherent swap interactions appear to be identical, its transient dynamics turns out to be significantly different. Here we present a comparative analysis of the consequences of having coherent or incoherent couplings in collision models, namely, PSWAP or CSWAP interactions respectively, for the emergence of memory effects for a single qubit system and for the onset synchronization between a pair of qubits, both of which are strictly determined by the transient dynamics of the open system.</description>

      <title>Efficient evaluation of real-time path integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feynman path integral has revolutionized modern approaches to quantum physics. Although the path integral formalism has proven very successful and spawned several approximation schemes, the direct evaluation of real-time path integrals is still extremely expensive and numerically delicate due to its high-dimensional and oscillatory nature. We propose an efficient method for the numerical evaluation of the real-time world-line path integral for theories where the potential is dominated by a quadratic at infinity. This is done by rewriting the high-dimensional oscillatory integral in terms of a series of low-dimensional oscillatory integrals, that we efficiently evaluate with Picard-Lefschetz theory or approximate with the eikonal approximation. Subsequently, these integrals are stitched together with a series of fast Fourier transformations to recover the lattice regularized Feynman path integral. Our method directly applies to problems in quantum mechanics, the word-line quantization of quantum field theory, and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE equation operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Similarly, we apply this approach to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the forward scattering term of the extended QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While this term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. Through this procedure, we obtain the leading order of the system's impulse. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semiclassical study of the Mixmaster cosmology minimally coupled to a massive scalar field in the Hamiltonian formalism, with focus on three distinct scenarios: the classical cosmology coupled to the quantized scalar field, and "effective" cosmology, with spacetime discreteness corrections, coupled to the classical scalar field, and to the quantized scalar field. We find several results: (i) the effective cosmology undergoes several small bounces before expanding, with scalar field excitations rising through the bounce; (ii) anisotropies rise and fall as the universe undergoes a bounce, a feature that is enhanced with matter; (iii) Lyapunov exponents reveal that chaos is reduced in the effective systems compared to the classical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The narrow bandgap of semiconductors allows for thick, uniform Josephson junction barriers, potentially enabling reproducible, stable, and compact superconducting qubits. We study vertically stacked van der Waals Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links, whose crystalline structures and clean interfaces offer a promising platform for quantum devices. We observe robust Josephson coupling across 2--12 nm (3--18 atomic layers) of semiconducting WSe$_2$ and, notably, a crossover from proximity- to tunneling-type behavior with increasing weak link thickness. Building on these results, we fabricate a prototype all-crystalline merged-element transmon qubit with transmon frequency and anharmonicity closely matching design parameters. We demonstrate dispersive coupling between this transmon and a microwave resonator, highlighting the potential of crystalline superconductor-semiconductor structures for compact, tailored superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Towards perfect quantum insulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric fields, applied to insulators, cause transitions between valence and conduction bands, giving rise to current. Adjustments of the Hamiltonian can perfect the quality of the insulator, shutting down transitions whilst fully preserving the many-particle state, but they are challenging to implement. Instead, adjusted Hamiltonians having desirable features are addressed variationally, via the analysis of a suitable figure of merit. They suppress current-enabling transitions whilst tending to preserve the many-particle state, and hence they yield optimal insulation. Emerging naturally from this approach are two established concepts: transitionless quantum driving [M. V. Berry, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 365303 (2009)] and (a modified) localization tensor [R. Resta and S. Sorella, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 370-373 (1999)]. The variational approach is illustrated via application to a tight-binding model. In this setting, the optimally adjusted Hamiltonian has a powerful impact on transition suppression and localization-tensor reduction, suggesting strong enhancement of insulation. These features are expected to be more general than the model that displays them.</description>

      <title>Hybrid integrated ultra-low linewidth coil stabilized isolator-free widely tunable external cavity laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision applications such as quantum computing, quantum and fiber sensing, and mmWave and RF generation, require ultra-low phase noise stabilized lasers operating at wavelengths across the visible to near-IR. These applications employ widely tunable table-scale laser systems, bulk-optic reference cavities, and optical isolation to achieve ultra-low frequency noise and high stability across wide wavelength ranges. Photonic integration promises to bring these laser systems to the chip-scale, enabling reliable, scalable and portable precision applications. Here we report record-low integrated laser linewidths with a coil-cavity stabilized 1550 nm tunable laser, that achieves 3 to 7 Hz fundamental linewidth across a 60 nm tuning range and 27 - 60 Hz integral linewidths with an Allan deviation of 1.8E-13 at 6.4 ms across 40 nm. These results represent 5 orders of magnitude noise reduction and almost 2-orders magnitude reduction in integral linewidth for widely tunable integrated lasers. The hybrid integrated silicon nitride external cavity tunable laser is stabilized to a silicon nitride 10-meter long integrated coil-resonator without the need for an optical isolator by leveraging the inherent 45 dB isolation. The laser and reference cavity are fabricated in the same 80 nm-thick ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguide CMOS foundry compatible process, which combined with the inherent isolation, unlocks the path towards fully integrated visible to NIR frequency-stabilized lasers.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as the cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a quantitative relational Hoare logic for quantum programs. Assertions of the logic range over a new infinitary extension of positive semidefinite operators. We prove that our logic is sound, and complete for bounded postconditions and almost surely terminating programs. Our completeness result is based on a quantum version of the duality theorem from optimal transport. We also define a complete embedding into our logic of a relational Hoare logic with projective assertions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Gauge Field for Ultracold Atoms Induced by Vector Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector beams (VBs) with spatially varying polarization have broad applications across various fields of optics. We introduce a novel use of VBs to generate synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms. By leveraging VBs' rich tunability, this scheme enables the emergence of angular stripe phases over a significantly expanded parameter range, achieving a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and thereby making experimental observation feasible. It also allows for the creation of topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology controlled by VB parameters and without requiring rotation. Our work opens new avenues for utilizing VBs in quantum control of ultracold atoms and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work, we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we precisely analyze how detailed updating schemes in the structural optimization algorithm affect its computational accuracy for the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Superconducting and Topological Properties in Mg-Li Electrides at High Pressures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrides as a unique class of emerging materials exhibit fascinating properties and hold important significance for understanding the matter under extreme conditions, which is characterized by valence electrons localized into the interstitial space as quasi-atoms (ISQs). In this work, using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we identified seven stable phases of Mg-Li that are electride with novel electronic properties under high pressure. Among them, MgLi10 is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.22 eV; and Pm-3m MgLi is superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature of 22.8 K. The important role played by the localization degree of ISQ in the superconducting transition temperature of these electrides is revealed by systematic comparison of Mg-Li with other Li-rich electride superconductors. Furthermore, we proved that Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi also have distinct topological behavior with metallic surface states and the non-zero $Z_2$ invariant. The simultaneous coexistence of superconductivity, electronic band topology and electride property in the same structure of Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi demonstrates the feasibility of realizing multi-quantum phases in a single material, which will stimulate further research in these interdisciplinary fields.</description>

Abstract: We present systems of parabosons and parafermions in the context of Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras, $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebras and $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebras. For certain relevant $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebras and $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebras, some structure theory in terms of roots and root vectors is developed. The short root vectors of these algebras are identified with parastatistics operators. For the $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie algebra $so_q(2n+1)$, a system consisting of two ensembles of parafermions satisfying relative paraboson relations are introduced. For the $\mathbf{{\mathbb Z}_2\ \times {\mathbb Z}_2}$-graded Lie superalgebra $osp(1,0|2n_1,2n_2)$, a system consisting of two ensembles of parabosons satisfying relative parafermion relations are introduced.</description>

      <title>Dispersive measurement of spin shot noise in a Bose--Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report dispersive spin shot noise measurement of a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC). While dispersive probing has been used for quantum spin noise measurement of thermal and cold gases for decades, confirmative measurement of spin shot noise, i.e.,\ the linear dependence of the spin variance on the number of atoms in a BEC has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate precise spin noise measurement of a BEC of rubidium atoms at the spin shot noise level by polarization rotation using a two-color probe at optimal detunings, with power balance stabilization to suppress probe-induced excess spin noise. This work opens the possibility for the unexplored study of quantum spin fluctuations in multi-component or spinor BECs and offers an approach to improve spin measurement precision, which is relevant to atomic spin-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Attention Mechanism in NLP: A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable results in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and machine translation. However, their computational complexity and resource demands pose challenges for scalability and accessibility. This research proposes a hybrid quantum-classical transformer model that integrates a quantum-enhanced attention mechanism to address these limitations. By leveraging quantum kernel similarity and variational quantum circuits (VQC), the model captures intricate token dependencies while improving computational efficiency. Experimental results on the IMDb dataset demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced model outperforms the classical baseline across all key metrics, achieving a 1.5% improvement in accuracy (65.5% vs. 64%), precision, recall, and F1 score. Statistical significance tests validate these improvements, highlighting the robustness of the quantum approach. These findings illustrate the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced attention mechanisms in optimizing NLP architectures for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate solutions of the Fermi-Hubbard model via symmetry-enhanced variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</description>

      <title>Braiding Majoranas in a linear quantum dot-superconductor array: Mitigating the errors from Coulomb repulsion and residual tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an ab initio method to solve quantum many-body problems of molecular dynamics where both the electronic and the nuclear degrees are represented by ensembles of trajectories and guiding waves in physical space. Both electrons and nuclei can be treated quantum mechanically where the guiding waves obey a set of coupled Schrodinger equations (quantum-quantum description) or, alternatively, coupled Schroedinger-Newtonian equations are solved for the quantum-classical approximation. The method takes into account local and non-local quantum correlation effects in a self consistent manner. The general formalism is applied to one- and two-dimensional hydrogen molecule subjected to a strong ultashort optical pulse. Comparison is made with the results from the 'exact' Ehrenfest molecular dynamics for the molecular ionization and for the evolution of the inter-nuclear distance as the molecule dissociates.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time-scaling quantum dynamics with time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we study the dynamics of many-body quantum systems using time dependent quantum Monte Carlo method where the evolution is described by ensembles of particles and guide waves. The exponential-time scaling inherent to the quantum many-body problem is reduced to polynomial-time computation by solving concurrently a set of coupled Schroedinger equations for the guide waves in physical space and a set first order equations for the Monte Carlo walkers. We use effective potentials to accounts for the local and nonlocal quantum correlations in time-varying fields, where for fermionic states an exchange 'hole' is introduced explicitly through screened Coulomb potentials. The walker distributions for the ground states of para- and ortho-helium reproduce well the statistical properties, such as the electron-pair density function, of the real atoms. Our predictions for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom exposed to strong ultrashort optical pulse are in good agreement with the exact results.</description>

      <title>Velocity-comb modulation transfer spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Doppler laser spectroscopy is a crucial technique for laser frequency stabilization, playing a significant role in atomic physics, precision measurement, and quantum communication. However, recent efforts to improve frequency stability appear to have reached a bottleneck, as they primarily focus on external technical approaches while neglecting the fundamental issue of low atomic utilization (&lt; 1%), caused by only near-zero transverse velocity atoms involved in the transition. Here, we propose a velocity-comb modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) solution that takes advantage of the velocity-selective resonance effect of multi-frequency comb lasers to enhance the utilization of non-zero-velocity atoms. In the probe-pump configuration, each pair of counter-propagating lasers interacts with atoms from different transverse velocity-comb groups, independently contributing to the spectral amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio. Preliminary proof-of-principle results show that the frequency stability of the triple-frequency laser is optimized by nearly a factor of \sqrt{3} compared to the single-frequency laser, consistent with theoretical expectations. With more frequency comb components, MTS-stabilized lasers are expected to achieve order-of-magnitude breakthroughs in frequency stability, taking an important step toward next-generation compact optical clocks. This unique method can also be widely applied to any quantum system with a wide velocity distribution, inspiring innovative advances in numerous fields with a fresh perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In understanding strongly correlated quantum systems, quantifying the non-Gaussian nature of interparticle correlations is invaluable. We show that, for a uniform quantum gas, there exists a natural connection between non-Gaussian correlations and the generation of momentum-space entanglement. Furthermore, this entanglement can be directly measured in an experiment using time-of-flight techniques. To prototype our method, we numerically study entanglement generation in a degenerate Bose gas following a quench to the unitary regime, where Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlations are generated sequentially in time.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Assisted Coding for Arbitrary Linear Computations Over a Quantum MAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a linear computation problem over a quantum multiple access channel (LC-QMAC), where $S$ servers share an entangled state and separately store classical data streams $W_1,\cdots, W_S$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_d$. A user aims to compute $K$ linear combinations of these data streams, represented as $Y = \mathbf{V}_1 W_1 + \mathbf{V}_2 W_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{V}_S W_S \in \mathbb{F}_d^{K \times 1}$. To this end, each server encodes its classical information into its local quantum subsystem and transmits it to the user, who retrieves the desired computations via quantum measurements. In this work, we propose an achievable scheme for LC-QMAC based on the stabilizer formalism and the ideas from entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECC). Specifically, given any linear computation matrix, we construct a self-orthogonal matrix that can be implemented using the stabilizer formalism. Also, we apply precoding matrices to minimize the number of auxiliary qudits required. Our scheme achieves more computations per qudit, i.e., a higher computation rate, compared to the best-known methods in the literature, and attains the capacity in certain cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</description>

Abstract: Message Authentication Code or MAC, is a well-studied cryptographic primitive that is used in order to authenticate communication between two parties sharing a secret key. A Tokenized MAC or TMAC is a related cryptographic primitive, introduced by Ben-David &amp; Sattath (QCrypt'17) which allows limited signing authority to be delegated to third parties via the use of single-use quantum signing tokens. These tokens can be issued using the secret key, such that each token can be used to sign at most one document. We provide an elementary construction for TMAC based on BB84 states. Our construction can tolerate up to 14% noise, making it the first noise-tolerant TMAC construction. The simplicity of the quantum states required for our construction combined with its noise tolerance, makes it practically more feasible than the previous TMAC construction. The TMAC is existentially unforgeable against adversaries with signing and verification oracles (i.e., analogous to EUF-CMA security for MAC), assuming post-quantum one-way functions exist.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Hamiltonian induced by finite-strength coupling to the environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a quantum system interacts with the environment, then the Hamiltonian acquires a correction known as the Lamb-shift term. There are two other corrections to the Hamiltonian, related to the stationary state. Namely, the stationary state is to first approximation a Gibbs state with respect to original Hamiltonian. However, if we have finite coupling, then the true stationary state will be different, and regarding it as a Gibbs state to some effective Hamiltonian, one can extract a correction, which is called "steady-state" correction. Alternatively, one can take a static point of view, and consider the reduced state of total equilibrium state, i.e., system plus bath Gibbs state. The extracted Hamiltonian correction is called the "mean-force" correction. This paper presents several analytical results on second-order corrections (in coupling strength) of the three types mentioned above. Instead of the steady state, we focus on a state annihilated by the Liouvillian of the master equation, labeling it as the "quasi-steady state." Specifically, we derive a general formula for the mean-force correction as well as the quasi-steady state and Lamb-shift correction for a general class of master equations. Furthermore, specific formulas for corrections are obtained for the Davies, Bloch-Redfield, and cumulant equation (refined weak coupling). In particular, the cumulant equation serves as a case study of the Liouvillian, featuring a nontrivial fourth-order generator. This generator forms the basis for calculating the diagonal quasi-steady-state correction. We consider spin-boson model as an example, and in addition to using our formulas for corrections, we consider mean-force correction from the reaction-coordinate approach.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the state preparation fidelity of highly entangled states on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is important for benchmarking and application considerations. Unfortunately, exact fidelity measurements quickly become prohibitively expensive, as they scale exponentially as $O(3^N)$ for $N$-qubit states, using full state tomography with measurements in all Pauli bases combinations. However, Somma and others [PhysRevA.74.052302] established that the complexity could be drastically reduced when looking at fidelity lower bounds for states that exhibit symmetries, such as Dicke States and GHZ States. These bounds must still be tight enough for larger states to provide reasonable estimations on NISQ devices.
  For the first time and more than 15 years after the theoretical introduction, we report meaningful lower bounds for the state preparation fidelity of all Dicke States up to $N=10$ and all GHZ states up to $N=20$ on Quantinuum H1 ion-trap systems using efficient implementations of recently proposed scalable circuits for these states. Our achieved lower bounds match or exceed previously reported exact fidelities on superconducting systems for much smaller states. Furthermore, we provide evidence that for large Dicke States $D^N_{N/2}$, we may resort to a GHZ-based approximate state preparation to achieve better fidelity. This work provides a path forward to benchmarking entanglement as NISQ devices improve in size and quality.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Distributed Source Simulation: As Quantum as it Can Get</title>

Abstract: Distributed source simulation is the task where two (or more) parties share some correlated randomness and use local operations and no communication to convert this into some target correlation. Wyner's seminal result showed that asymptotically the rate of uniform shared randomness needed for this task is given by a mutual information induced measure, now referred to as Wyner's common information. This asymptotic result was extended by Hayashi in the quantum setting to separable states, the largest class of states for which this task can be performed to vanishing error. In this work we characterize this task in a near-tight manner in the one-shot setting using the smooth entropy framework. We do this by introducing one-shot operational quantities and correlation measures that characterize them. We establish asymptotic equipartition properties for our correlation measures thereby recovering the previous vanishing-error asymptotic results. In doing so, we consider technical points in one-shot network information theory and provide methods for cardinality bounds in the smooth entropy calculus. We also introduce entangled state versions of the distributed source simulation task and determine bounds in this setting via quantum embezzling. This provides a strong characterization of this network task in the one-shot, quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum Otto Engine Performance via Additional Magnetic Field and Effective Negative Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a protocol for a four-stroke quantum Otto engine that is capable of achieving superior performance when operating between two thermal reservoirs: one at a positive spin temperature and the other at an effective negative spin temperature. We adopt a protocol that encompasses a rotating magnetic field in the (x, y)-plane, as well as an additional magnetic field in the (z)-direction that possesses distinct strengths. Consequently, we acquire the capability to manipulate the strength of the magnetic field autonomously in both directions during dynamics. We report that by precisely adjusting the strength and the direction of the magnetic field in the (z)-direction and manipulating other relevant system parameters, we can effectively enhance the transition probability and hence the efficiency of the engine as well which can not be achieved without the additional magnetic field, although the impact is not ubiquitous. Additionally, another important significance of our model is that these engines operate within an extended operational domain, reaching into temperature ranges where the effective negative temperature-based quantum Otto engines operating only on the rotational magnetic field in the (x,y) plane, are unable to function. Specifically, we identify a threshold value for the magnetic field, dependent on the driving time, at which an improvement in efficiency is observed. We propose that this advantage may arise from the system exhibiting greater coherence with respect to the driving time, which we evaluate using the l1-norm coherence measure. Another noteworthy aspect is that the advantage in efficiency gained from the additional magnetic field continues to surpass that of the protocol without the field, even in the presence of impurities in the magnetic field having a specific range of disorder strengths.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Time Quantum Algorithm for Exponentially Large Scale Nonlinear Differential Equations via Hamiltonian Simulation</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to efficiently solve a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which play a crucial role in various industries and scientific fields. However, it remains unclear which system of nonlinear ODEs, and under what assumptions, can achieve exponential speedup using quantum computers. In this work, we introduce a class of systems of nonlinear ODEs that can be efficiently solved on quantum computers, where the efficiency is defined as solving the system with computational complexity of $O(T {\rm log}(N) {\rm polylog}(1/\epsilon))$, where $T$ is the evolution time, $\epsilon$ is the allowed error, and $N$ is the number of variables in the system. Specifically, we employ the Koopman-von Neumann linearization to map the system of nonlinear ODEs to Hamiltonian dynamics and find conditions where the norm of the mapped Hamiltonian is preserved and the Hamiltonian is sparse. This allows us to use the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technique for solving the nonlinear ODEs with $O({\rm log}(N))$ overhead. Furthermore, we show that the nonlinear ODEs include a wide range of systems of nonlinear ODEs, such as the nonlinear harmonic oscillators and the short-range Kuramoto model. Since this is the first concrete example of solving systems of nonlinear ODEs with exponential quantum speedup by the Koopman-von Neumann linearization, these findings contribute significantly to the application of quantum computers in solving nonlinear problems.</description>

Abstract: Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time $t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining $t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how $t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number $N$. The presence of a classical instability leads to $t_q \sim \ln N$ or $t_q\sim \sqrt{N}$. In the stable case, we observe $t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with $t_q\sim N^\gamma$ ($0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: Shortening quantum circuits is crucial to reducing the destructive effect of environmental decoherence and enabling useful algorithms. Here, we demonstrate an improvement in such compilation tasks via a combination of using hybrid discrete-continuous optimization across a continuous gate set, and architecture-tailored implementation. The continuous parameters are discovered with a gradient-based optimization algorithm, while in tandem the optimal gate orderings are learned via a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on projective simulation. To test this approach, we introduce a framework to simulate collective gates in trapped-ion systems efficiently on a classical device. The algorithm proves able to significantly reduce the size of relevant quantum circuits for trapped-ion computing. Furthermore, we show that our framework can also be applied to an experimental setup whose goal is to reproduce an unknown unitary process.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of weighted graphs uncovers transitions in variable-range interacting models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model can generate a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS) that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian. We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can detect the transition points present in the fall-off rates of the interaction strength, separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits to be reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10967v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Page-Wootters formalism is a proposal for reconciling the background-dependent, quantum-mechanical notion of time with the background independence of general relativity. However, the physical meaning of this framework remains debated. In this work, we compare two consistent approaches to the Page-Wootters formalism to clarify the operational meaning of evolution and measurements with respect to a temporal quantum reference frame. The so-called "twirled observable" approach implements measurements as operators that are invariant with respect to the Hamiltonian constraint. The "purified measurement" approach instead models measurements dynamically by modifying the constraint itself. While both approaches agree in the limit of ideal clocks, a natural generalization of the purified measurement approach to the case of non-ideal, finite-resource clocks yields a radically different picture. We discuss the physical origin of this discrepancy and argue that these approaches describe operationally distinct situations. Moreover, we show that, for non-ideal clocks, the purified measurement approach yields a time non-local evolution equation, which can lead to non-unitary evolution. Moreover, it implies a fundamental limitation to the operational definition of the temporal order of events. Nevertheless, unitarity and definite temporal order can be restored if we assume that time is discrete.</description>

Abstract: We propose the notion of process resource-breaking channels that break the resource for a quantum information processing task. We examine the same using quantum dense coding and teleportation protocols. We prove that the sets DBT (dense coding breaking) and TBT (teleportation breaking) are convex and compact and identify classical-quantum channels as their extreme points. We prove group-covariance to be a sufficient condition for channels to be DBT or TBT when they can destroy the resource of maximally entangled states. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for unital channels to be DBT for a single sender-receiver pair, while for multiple senders, the condition is sufficient. The set of qubit TBT channels is proved equivalent to qubit entanglement-breaking channels provided pre-processing is allowed. We construct witness operators to identify non-TBT(non-DBT) maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum repeaters poses significant challenges in terms of cost and maintenance, prompting the exploration of alternative approaches for achieving long-distance quantum communication. In the absence of quantum repeaters and under the memoryless (iid) approximation, it has been established that some fundamental quantum communication tasks are impossible if the transmissivity of an optical fibre falls below a known critical value, resulting in a severe constraint on the achievable distance for quantum communication. However, if the memoryless assumption does not hold -- e.g. when input signals are separated by a sufficiently short time interval -- the validity of this limitation is put into question. In this paper we introduce a model of optical fibre that can describe memory effects for long transmission lines. We then solve its quantum capacity, two-way quantum capacity, and secret-key capacity exactly. By doing so, we show that -- due to the memory cross-talk between the transmitted signals -- reliable quantum communication is attainable even for highly noisy regimes where it was previously considered impossible. As part of our solution, we find the critical time interval between subsequent signals below which quantum communication, two-way entanglement distribution, and quantum key distribution become achievable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a hybrid quantum-classical approach to treat quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. This is done by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCE) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Here, the VQE algorithm is used as a cluster solver within the NLCE. We test our hybrid quantum-classical algorithm (NLCE$+$VQE) for the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. The calculation of ground-state energies on each open cluster demands a modified Hamiltonian variational ansatz for the VQE. One major finding is convergence of NLCE$+$VQE to the conventional NLCE result in the thermodynamic limit when at least $N/2$ layers are used in the VQE ansatz for each cluster with $N$ sites. Our approach demonstrates the fruitful connection of techniques known from correlated quantum many-body systems with hybrid algorithms explored on existing quantum-computing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores an approach to routing in quantum networks, which targets practical scenarios for quantum networks, mirroring real-world classical networks. By addressing practical constraints, we examine the impact of heterogeneous nodes with mixed efficiency figures on quantum network performance. In particular, we focus on some key parameters in an operational quantum network such as the fraction of nodes with a higher efficiency (called high-quality), path establishment order, end-to-end fidelity, i.e., a measure of the quality of the end-to-end entanglement established. Our simulations show that incorporating knowledge of node quality not only helps boost the fidelity of some of the routing paths but also reduces the number of blocked paths in the quantum network. The study also highlights the critical role of the fraction of high-quality nodes in end-to-end fidelity and explores the trade-offs between upgrading all nodes to high quality or retaining a subset of lower-quality nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum rotor is one of the simplest model systems in quantum mechanics, but only in recent years has theoretical work revealed general fundamental scaling laws for its decoherence. For example, a superposition of orientations decoheres at a rate proportional to the sine squared of the angle between them. Here we observe scaling laws for rotational decoherence dynamics for the first time, using a 4-micrometer diameter planar rotor composed of two Paul-trapped ions. We prepare the rotational motion of the ion crystal into superpositions of angular momentum with well-defined differences ranging from 1-3 $\hbar$, and measure the rate of decoherence. We also tune the system-environment interaction strength by introducing resonant electric field noise. The observed scaling relationships for decoherence are in excellent agreement with recent theoretical work, and are directly relevant to the growing development of rotor-based quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The no-cloning theorem leads to information-theoretic security in various quantum cryptographic protocols. However, this security typically derives from a possibly weaker property that classical information encoded in certain quantum states cannot be broadcast. To formally capture this property, we introduce the study of "orthogonality broadcasting." When attempting to broadcast the orthogonality of two different qubit bases, we establish that the power of classical and quantum communication is equivalent. However, quantum communication is shown to be strictly more powerful for broadcasting orthogonality in higher dimensions. We then relate orthogonality broadcasting to quantum position verification and provide a new method for establishing error bounds in the no pre-shared entanglement model that can address protocols previous methods could not. Our key technical contribution is an uncertainty relation that uses the geometric relation of the states that undergo broadcasting rather than the non-commutative aspect of the final measurements.</description>

      <title>Metrological Advantages in Seeded and Lossy Nonlinear Interferometers</title>

Abstract: The quantum Fisher information (QFI) bounds the sensitivity of a quantum measurement, heralding the conditions for quantum advantages when compared with classical strategies. Here, we calculate analytical expressions for the QFI of nonlinear interferometers under lossy conditions and with coherent-state seeding. We normalize the results based on the number of photons going through the sample that induces a phase shift on the incident quantum state, which eliminates some of the previously declared metrological advantages. We analyze the performance of nonlinear interferometers in a variety of geometries and robustness of the quantum advantage with respect to internal and external loss through direct comparison with a linear interferometer. We find the threshold on the internal loss at which the quantum advantage vanishes, specify when and how much coherent-state seeding optimally counters internal loss, and show that a sufficient amount of squeezing confers to the quantum advantages robustness against external loss and inefficient detection.</description>

      <title>Fundamental charges for dual-unitary circuits</title>

Abstract: Dual-unitary quantum circuits have recently attracted attention as an analytically tractable model of many-body quantum dynamics. Consisting of a 1+1D lattice of 2-qudit gates arranged in a 'brickwork' pattern, these models are defined by the constraint that each gate must remain unitary under swapping the roles of space and time. This dual-unitarity restricts the dynamics of local operators in these circuits: the support of any such operator must grow at the effective speed of light of the system, along one or both of the edges of a causal light cone set by the geometry of the circuit. Using this property, it is shown here that for 1+1D dual-unitary circuits the set of width-$w$ conserved densities (constructed from operators supported over $w$ consecutive sites) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of width-$w$ solitons - operators which, up to a multiplicative phase, are simply spatially translated at the effective speed of light by the dual-unitary dynamics. A number of ways to construct these many-body solitons (explicitly in the case where the local Hilbert space dimension $d=2$) are then demonstrated: firstly, via a simple construction involving products of smaller, constituent solitons; and secondly, via a construction which cannot be understood as simply in terms of products of smaller solitons, but which does have a neat interpretation in terms of products of fermions under a Jordan-Wigner transformation. This provides partial progress towards a characterisation of the microscopic structure of complex many-body solitons (in dual-unitary circuits on qubits), whilst also establishing a link between fermionic models and dual-unitary circuits, advancing our understanding of what kinds of physics can be explored in this framework.</description>

      <title>Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</description>

Abstract: The Choi representation of completely positive (CP) maps, i.e. quantum channels is often used in the context of quantum information and computation as it is easy to work with. It is a correspondence between CP maps and quantum states also termed as the Choi-Jamio\l kowski isomorphism. It is especially useful if a parametrization of the set of CP maps is needed in order to consider a general map or optimize over the set of these. Here we provide a brief introduction to this topic, focusing on certain useful calculational techniques which are presented in full detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for the solution of prototypical second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations discretized by $d$-linear finite elements on Cartesian grids of a bounded $d$-dimensional domain. An essential step in the construction is a BPX preconditioner, which transforms the linear system into a sufficiently well-conditioned one, making it amenable to quantum computation. We provide a constructive proof demonstrating that, for any fixed dimension, our quantum algorithm can compute suitable functionals of the solution to a given tolerance $\mathtt{tol}$ with an optimal complexity of order $\mathtt{tol}^{-1}$ up to logarithmic terms, significantly improving over existing approaches. Notably, this approach does not rely on regularity of the solution and achieves quantum advantage over classical solvers in two dimensions, whereas prior quantum methods required at least four dimensions for asymptotic benefits. We further detail the design and implementation of a quantum circuit capable of executing our algorithm, present simulator results, and report numerical experiments on current quantum hardware, confirming the feasibility of preconditioned finite element methods for near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold considerable potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, making even machine learning-based screening calculations time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a rapid method for predicting HEA properties using data from monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). Central to our approach is the newly introduced local surface energy (LSE) descriptor, which captures local surface reactivity at atomic resolution. We established a correlation between LSE and adsorption energies using monometallic systems. Using this correlation in a linear regression model, we successfully estimated molecular adsorption energies on HEAs with significantly higher accuracy than a conventional descriptor (i.e., generalized coordination numbers). Furthermore, we developed high-precision models by employing both classical and quantum machine learning. Our method enabled CO adsorption-energy calculations for 1000 quinary nanoparticles, comprising 201 atoms each, within a few days, considerably faster than density functional theory, which would require hundreds of years or neural network potentials, which would have taken hundreds of days. The proposed approach accelerates the exploration of the vast HEA chemical space, facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</description>

      <title>Linear-optical approach to encoding qubits into harmonic-oscillator modes via quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a linear-optical scheme that allows encoding grid-state quantum bits (qubits) into a bosonic mode using cat state and post-selection as sources of non-Gaussianity in the encoding. As a linear-optical realization of the quantum-walk encoding scheme in [Lin {\em et al.}, Quantum Info. Processing {\bf 19}, 272 (2020)], we employ the cat state as a quantum coin that enables encoding approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits through quantum walk of a squeezed vacuum state in phase space. We show that the conditional phase-space displacement necessary for the encoding can be realized through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) assisted with ancillary cat-state input under appropriate parameter regimes. By analyzing the fidelity of the MZI-based displacement operation, we identify the region of parameter space over which the proposed linear-optical scheme can generate grid-state qubits with high fidelity. With adequate parameter setting, our proposal should be accessible to current optical and superconducting-circuit platforms in preparing grid-state qubits for bosonic modes in the, respectively, optical and microwave domains.</description>

      <title>Efficient explicit gate construction of block-encoding for Hamiltonians needed for simulating partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is solving partial differential equations (PDEs). By using the Schrodingerisation technique - which converts non-conservative PDEs into Schrodinger equations - the problem can be reduced to Hamiltonian simulations. The particular class of Hamiltonians we consider is shown to be sufficient for simulating almost any linear PDE. In particular, these Hamiltonians consist of discretizations of polynomial products and sums of position and momentum operators. This paper addresses an important gap by efficiently loading these Hamiltonians into the quantum computer through block-encoding. The construction is explicit and efficient in terms of one- and two-qubit operations, forming a fundamental building block for constructing the unitary evolution operator for that class of Hamiltonians. The proposed algorithm demonstrates a squared logarithmic scaling with respect to the spatial partitioning size, offering a polynomial speedup over classical finite-difference methods in the context of spatial partitioning for PDE solving. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the multi-dimensional case, achieving an exponential acceleration with respect to the number of dimensions, alleviating the curse of dimensionality problem. This work provides an essential foundation for developing explicit and efficient quantum circuits for PDEs, Hamiltonian simulations, and ground state and thermal state preparation.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamics of quantum entanglement using the negativity criterion for the W_zeta quantum state. We investigate changes in negativity in terms of anisotropy parameters, gamma, the strength of the external magnetic field applied to the spin chain, eta, the triple interaction strength, alpha. We examine how these parameters affect the entanglement properties of the system and discuss the implications for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols. By analyzing the negativity of the W_zeta state under different conditions, we gain insights into the behaviour of entanglement in complex quantum systems. Our results shed light on the intricate interplay between various factors that influence quantum entanglement and provide a foundation for further investigations in this field of research.</description>

      <title>Parity-controlled gate in a two-dimensional neutral-atom array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a parity-controlled gate within a two-dimensional Rydberg atom array, enabling efficient discrimination between even and odd parities of virtually excited control atoms by monitoring the dynamic evolution of an auxiliary atom. This is achieved through the use of spin-exchange dipolar interactions between Rydberg states and coupling between ground states and Rydberg states. For practical applications, we explore its implementation in three-qubit repetition codes and rotated surface codes featuring $XZZX$ stabilizers, enabling single-shot readout of stabilizer measurements. Comprehensive numerical simulations are conducted to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach, taking into account potential experimental imperfections such as unwanted interactions between Rydberg states, atomic position fluctuations, laser phase noise, and Rabi amplitude noise. Our study highlights the inherent advantages of the physical mechanisms underlying parity measurement, demonstrating its reliability and practicality. These findings establish our protocol as a highly promising solution for quantum error detection and computation within Rydberg atom systems, with significant potential for future experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Robustness of perfect transmission resonances to asymmetric perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of asymmetric perturbations on the perfect transmission resonances (PTRs) of one-dimensional finite periodic systems. With no perturbations, the scattering region consists of $N$ identical cells, and the transmission spectrum exhibits at least $N-1$ PTRs in each pass band of the Bloch dispersion of the unit cell. By introducing a perturbation, the periodic structure is broken, which \textit{a priori} results in the elimination of all PTRs. However, we demonstrate that PTRs can still arise under asymmetric perturbations when the unperturbed system possesses mirror symmetry, utilizing the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the unperturbed reflectionless eigenvalue problem. We also reveal an intriguing connection between two seemingly independent PTRs that lies in the symmetry of the unperturbed unit cell: If one PTR is preserved, then a dual one is necessarily also preserved. Our findings offer insights for the design of, for example, a robust antireflection setup at multiple wavelengths or all-optical diode devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Chromatic-Number-Based Multi-Qubit Decoherence and Crosstalk Suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of quantum computers is hindered by decoherence and crosstalk, which cause errors and limit the ability to perform long computations. Dynamical decoupling is a technique that alleviates these issues by applying carefully timed pulses to individual qubits, effectively suppressing unwanted interactions. However, as quantum devices grow in size, it becomes increasingly important to minimize the time required to implement dynamical decoupling across the entire system. Here, we present "Chromatic-Hadamard Dynamical Decoupling" (CHaDD), an approach that efficiently schedules dynamical decoupling pulses for quantum devices with arbitrary qubit connectivity. By leveraging Hadamard matrices, CHaDD achieves a circuit depth that scales linearly with the chromatic number of the connectivity graph for general two-qubit interactions, assuming instantaneous pulses. This includes ZZ crosstalk, which is prevalent in superconducting QPUs. CHaDD's scaling represents an exponential improvement over all previous multi-qubit decoupling schemes for devices with connectivity graphs whose chromatic number grows at most polylogarithmically with the number of qubits. For graphs with a constant chromatic number, CHaDD's scaling is independent of the number of qubits. We report on experiments we have conducted using IBM QPUs that confirm the advantage conferred by CHaDD. Our results suggest that CHaDD can become a useful tool for enhancing the performance and scalability of quantum computers by efficiently suppressing decoherence and crosstalk across large qubit arrays.</description>

Abstract: Characterization of quantum states and devices is paramount to quantum science and technology. The characterization consists of individual measurements, which are required to be precisely known. A mismatch between actual and assumed constituent measurements limits the accuracy of this characterization. Here, we show that such a mismatch introduces reconstruction artifacts in quantum state tomography. We use these artifacts to detect and quantify the mismatch and gain information about the actual measurement operators. It consequently allows the mitigation of systematic errors in quantum measurement and state preparation.</description>

Abstract: Given the diverse array of physical systems available for quantum computing and the absence of a well-defined quantum internet protocol stack, the design and optimisation of quantum networking protocols remain largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce an approach that facilitates the establishment of paths capable of delivering end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold, without requiring detailed knowledge of the quantum network properties. In this study, we define algorithms that are specific instances of this approach and evaluate them in comparison to Dijkstra shortest path algorithm and a fully knowledge-aware algorithm through simulations. Our results demonstrate that one of the proposed algorithms consistently outperforms the other methods in delivering paths above the fidelity threshold, across various network topologies and the number of source-destination pairs involved, while maintaining significant levels of fairness among the users and being robust to inaccurate estimations of the expected end-to-end fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Non-orthogonal quantum states pose a fundamental challenge in quantum information processing, as they cannot be distinguished with absolute certainty. Conventionally, the focus has been on minimizing error probability in quantum state discrimination tasks. However, another criterion known as quantum guesswork has emerged as a crucial measure in assessing the distinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states, when we are allowed to query a sequence of states. In this paper, we generalize well known properties in the classical setting that are relevant for the guessing problem. Specifically, we establish the pre and post Data Processing Inequalities. We also derive a more refined lower bound on quantum guesswork.</description>

      <title>Bit-flip errors in dissipative cat qubits: second-order perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative cat qubits are known for the exponential suppression of the bit-flip rate. However, there is significant discrepancy between experimental measurements and analytical predictions of the strength of the bit-flip suppression. In this paper we resolve this discrepancy for some of the perturbations, by developing a second-order perturbation theory on top of a nonlinear dissipative Lindbladian. Following this scheme, we derive an analytical expression for the exponentially small bit-flip rate due to single-photon loss, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. We also apply our scheme to other perturbations, such as frequency detuning and the Z gate, and find the corresponding bit-flip rates, which also show good agreement with the numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>State preparation of lattice field theories using quantum optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the application of quantum optimal control (QOC) techniques to state preparation of lattice field theories on quantum computers. As a first example, we focus on the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions. We demonstrate that QOC can significantly speed up the ground state preparation compared to gate-based methods, even for models with long-range interactions. Using classical simulations, we explore the dependence on the inter-qubit coupling strength and the device connectivity, and we study the optimization in the presence of noise. While our simulations indicate potential speedups, the results strongly depend on the device specifications. In addition, we perform exploratory studies on the preparation of thermal states. Our results motivate further studies of QOC techniques in the context of quantum simulations for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Stronger sum uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uncertainty relations (URs) of two arbitrary Hermitian and non-Hermitian incompatible operators represented by the product of variances have been confirmed theoretically and experimentally in various physical systems. However, the lower bound of the product uncertainty inequality can be null even for two non-commuting operators, i.e., a trivial case. Therefore, for two incompatible operators over the measured system state, the associated URs regarding the sum of variances are valid in a state-dependent manner, and the lower bound is guaranteed to be nontrivial. Although the sum URs formulated for Hermitian and unitary operators have been affirmed, the general forms for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators have not yet been investigated. This study presents the sum URs for non-Hermitian operators acting on system states using an appropriate Hilbert-space metric. The compatible forms of our sum inequalities with the conventional quantum mechanics are also provided via the G-metric formalism. Concrete examples illustrate the validity of the proposed sum URs in both PT-symmetric and PT-broken phases. The developed methods and results can help give an in-depth understanding of the usefulness of G-metric formalism in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics and the sum URs of incompatible operators within.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Hierarchical Equations Of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an extended version of the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) to compute output physical properties of a bosonic environment, which is allowed to be initially prepared at an earlier time in a non-Gaussian input state and then non-perturbatively interact with a quantum system with a linear environmental operator. While spectral assumptions analogous to the ones used in the regular HEOM are imposed to compute dynamical output bath observables, they are not required to model input states or output observables at a fixed time, in this case leading to time-dependent contributions to the equations. In the Markovian limit, we use this formalism to derive an input-output Lindblad equation which can be used to extend the applicability of the regular version. For a given desired input state and output observable, the range of the indexes extending the regular HEOM is, by construction, bounded. Overall, the aim of this formalism is to take advantage of the efficiency and generality of the HEOM framework to model non-Gaussian input states and the dynamics of environmental observables in bosonic, non-Markovian open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastically bundled dissipators for the quantum master equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a fundamental tool for describing the evolution of open quantum systems, but its computational complexity poses a significant challenge, especially for large systems. This article introduces a stochastic representation of the Lindblad dissipator that addresses this challenge by bundling the Lindblad operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by considering a Morse oscillator coupled to a spin bath. Our numerical experiments show that a small number of stochastically bundled operators can accurately capture the system's dynamics, even when the Hilbert space dimension is large. This method offers a new perspective on open quantum systems and provides a computationally efficient way to simulate their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limit on the Power of Entanglement Assistance in Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal rate of reliable communication over a quantum channel can be enhanced by pre-shared entanglement. Whereas the enhancement may be unbounded in infinite-dimensional settings even when the input power is constrained, a long-standing conjecture asserts that the ratio between the entanglement-assisted and unassisted classical capacities is bounded in finite-dimensional settings [Bennett et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 48, 2637 (2002)]. In this work, we prove this conjecture by showing that their ratio is upper bounded by $o(d^2)$, where $d$ is the input dimension of the channel. An application to quantum communication with noisy encoders and decoders is given.</description>

      <title>Additivity of quantum capacities in simple non-degradable quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum channel capacities give the fundamental performance limits for information flow over a communication channel. However, the prevalence of superadditivity is a major obstacle to understanding capacities, both quantitatively and conceptually. In contrast, examples exhibiting additivity, though relatively rare, offer crucial insights into the origins of nonadditivity and form the basis of our strongest upper bounds on capacity. Degradable channels, whose coherent information is provably additive, stand out as among the few classes of channels for which the quantum capacity is exactly computable.
  In this paper, we introduce two families of non-degradable channels whose coherent information remains additive, making their quantum capacities tractable. First, we demonstrate that channels capable of ``outperforming" their environment, under conditions weaker than degradability, can exhibit either strong or weak additivity of coherent information. Second, we explore a complementary construction that modifies a channel to preserve coherent information additivity while destroying the ``outperforming" property. We analyze how structural constraints guarantee strong and weak additivity and investigate how relaxing these constraints leads to the failure of strong additivity, with weak additivity potentially persisting.</description>

      <title>A Novel Finite Fractional Fourier Transform and its Quantum Circuit Implementation on Qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new number theoretic definition of discrete fractional Fourier transform (DFrFT) . In this approach the DFrFT is defined as the $N \times N$ dimensional unitary representation of the generator of the arithmetic rotational group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, which is the finite set of $\bmod N$ integer, $2\times 2$ matrices acting on the points of the discrete toroidal phase space lattice $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$, preserving the euclidean distance $\bmod N$. We construct explicitly, using techniques of the Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM), the $p^n$ dimensional unitary matrix representation of the group $SO_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_{p^n}]$ and especially we work out in detail the one which corresponds to the generator. This is our definition of the arithmetic fractional Fourier transform (AFrFT). Following this definition, we proceed to the construction of efficient quantum circuits for the AFrFT, on sets of $n$ $p$-dimensional qudits with $p$ a prime integer, by introducing novel quantum subcircuits for diagonal operators with quadratic phases as well as new quantum subcircuits for multipliers by a constant. The quantum subcircuits that we introduce provide a set capable to construct quantum circuits for any element of a more general group, the group of Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT), $SL_{2}[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ of the toroidal phase space lattice. As a byproduct, extensions of the diagonal and multiplier quantum circuits for both the qudit and qubit case are given, which are useful alone in various applications. Also, we analyze the depth, width and gate complexity of the efficient AFrFT quantum circuit and we estimate its gate complexity which is of the order $O(n^2)$, its depth which is of the order $O(n)$ with depth $n$, while at the same time it has a structure permitting local interactions between the qudits.</description>

      <title>Residual-$ZZ$-coupling suppression and fast two-qubit gate for Kerr-cat qubits based on level-degeneracy engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building large-scale quantum computers requires an interqubit-coupling scheme with a high on-off ratio to avoid unwanted crosstalk coming from residual coupling and to enable fast multi-qubit operations. We propose a $ZZ$-coupling scheme for two Kerr-cat qubits with a frequency-tunable coupler. By making four relevant states of the two Kerr-cat qubits quadruply degenerate, we can switch off the $ZZ$ coupling. By partially lifting the level degeneracy, we can switch it on. We theoretically show that an experimentally feasible circuit model suppresses the residual $ZZ$ coupling. Moreover, our circuit can realize $R_{ZZ}(-\pi/2)$-gate fidelity higher than $99.9\%$ within $18$ ns when decoherence is ignored. Our model includes the first-order terms in expansion beyond the rotating-wave approximation.</description>

      <title>Absorbing State Phase Transitions and Stability of Long-Range Coherence in Dissipative Quantum State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase. Furthermore, we argue that the long range coherence of the absorbing state leads to critical behavior distinct from Directed Percolation, the typical universality class for reaction-diffusion models.</description>

Abstract: One cannot justifiably presuppose the physical salience of structures derived via decoherence theory based upon an entirely uninterpreted use of the quantum formalism. Non-probabilistic accounts of the emergence of probability via decoherence are unconvincing. An alternative account of the emergence of probability involves the combination of a partially interpreted decoherence model and an averaging of observables with respect to a positive-definite quasi-probability function and neglect of terms $O(\hbar)$. Our analysis delimits the context in which the combination of decoherence and a semi-classical averaging allows us to recover a classical probability model within an emergent coarse-grained description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data poisoning attacks on machine learning models aim to manipulate the data used for model training such that the trained model behaves in the attacker's favour. In classical models such as deep neural networks, large chains of dot products do indeed cause errors injected by an attacker to propagate or accumulate. But what about quantum models? We hypothesise that, in quantum machine learning, error propagation is limited for two reasons. The first is that data, which is encoded in quantum computing, is in terms of qubits that are confined to the Bloch sphere. Second, quantum information processing happens via the application of unitary operators, which preserve norms. Testing this hypothesis, we investigate how extensive error propagation and, thus, poisoning attacks affect quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>A Liquid-Core Fiber Platform for Classical and Entangled Two-Photon Absorption Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a toluene-filled fiber platform for two-photon absorption measurements. By confining both the light and molecular sample inside the 5 $\mu$m hollow core of the fiber, we increase the distance over which the nonlinear light-matter interaction occurs. With only a 7.3 nL excitation volume, we measure classical two-photon absorption (C2PA) at an average laser power as low as 1.75 nW, which is a 45-fold improvement over a conventional free-space technique. We use this platform to attempt to measure entangled two-photon absorption (E2PA), a process with a limited regime where the quantum advantage is large. This regime arises due to a crossover from linear to quadratic scaling with photon flux as photon flux is increased. Recently, several teams of researchers have reported that E2PA cross-sections are much smaller than previously claimed. As a result, the linear scaling dominates at photon fluxes so low that it is extremely difficult or impossible to measure using conventional free-space techniques. In this report, we implement the first E2PA measurement using a waveguide. We see no evidence of E2PA, and we set an upper bound on the cross-section consistent with these recent reports.</description>

Abstract: The development of future quantum devices requires understanding the dynamics of driven many-body systems, in which the Floquet-induced interactions play a central role. This understanding is crucial for coherently controlling quantum states, minimising errors, and benchmarking the performance of these devices. In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Untelegraphable Encryption and its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of untelegraphable encryption (UTE), founded on the no-telegraphing principle, which allows an encryptor to encrypt a message such that a binary string representation of the ciphertext cannot be decrypted by a user with the secret key, a task that is classically impossible. This is a natural relaxation of unclonable encryption (UE), inspired by the recent work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS 2024), who showed a computational separation between the no-cloning and no-telegraphing principles. In this work, we define and construct UTE information-theoretically in the plain model. Building off this, we give several applications of UTE and study the interplay of UTE with UE and well-studied tasks in quantum state learning, yielding the following contributions:
  - A construction of collusion-resistant UTE from plain secret-key encryption, which we then show denies the existence of hyper-efficient shadow tomography (HEST). By building a relaxation of collusion-resistant UTE, we show the impossibility of HEST assuming only pseudorandom state generators (which may not imply one-way functions). This almost unconditionally answers an open inquiry of Aaronson (STOC 2018).
  - A construction of UTE from a one-shot message authentication code in the classical oracle model, such that there is an explicit attack that breaks UE security for an unbounded polynomial number of decryptors.
  - A construction of everlasting secure collusion-resistant UTE, where the decryptor adversary can run in unbounded time, in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), and formal evidence that a construction in the plain model is a challenging task. We leverage this construction to show that HEST with unbounded post-processing time is impossible in the QROM.
  - Constructions of secret sharing resilient to joint and unbounded classical leakage and untelegraphable functional encryption.</description>

Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum physics is a central approach to investigating physical phenomena. Quantum computers enhance computational capabilities beyond those of classical resources, but it remains unclear to what extent existing limited quantum computers can contribute to this enhancement. In this work, we explore a new hybrid, efficient quantum-classical representation of quantum states, the multiple-basis representation. This representation consists of a linear combination of states that are sparse in some given and different bases, specified by quantum circuits. Such representation is particularly appealing when considering depth-limited quantum circuits within reach of current hardware. We analyze the expressivity of multiple-basis representation states depending on the classical simulability of their quantum circuits. In particular, we show that multiple-basis representation states include, but are not restricted to, both matrix-product states and stabilizer states. Furthermore, we find cases in which this representation can be used, namely approximation of ground states, simulation of deeper computations by specifying bases with shallow circuits, and a tomographical protocol to describe states as multiple-basis representations. We envision this work to open the path of simultaneous use of several hardware-friendly bases, a natural description of hybrid computational methods accessible for near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Randomly Compiled Quantum Simulation with Exponentially Reduced Circuit Depths</title>

Abstract: The quantum stochastic drift protocol, also known as qDRIFT, has become a popular algorithm for implementing time-evolution of quantum systems using randomised compiling. In this work we develop qFLO, a higher order randomised algorithm for time-evolution. To estimate an observable expectation value at time $T$ to precision $\epsilon$, we show it is sufficient to use circuit depths of $O(T^2\log(1/\epsilon))$ -- an exponential improvement over standard qDRIFT requirements with respect to $\epsilon$. The protocol achieves this using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ repeated runs of the standard qDRIFT protocol combined with classical post-processing in the form of Richardson extrapolation. Notably, it requires no ancillary qubits or additional control gates making it especially promising for near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, it is well-conditioned and inherits many desirable properties of randomly compiled simulation methods, including circuit depths that do not explicitly depend on the number of terms in the Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: In spite of its unbroken ${\cal PT}-$symmetry, the popular imaginary cubic oscillator Hamiltonian $H^{(IC)}=p^2+{\rm i}x^3$ does not satisfy all of the necessary postulates of quantum mechanics. The failure is due to the ``intrinsic exceptional point'' (IEP) features of $H^{(IC)}$ and, in particular, to the phenomenon of a high-energy asymptotic parallelization of its bound-state-mimicking eigenvectors. In the paper it is argued that the operator $H^{(IC)}$ (and the like) can only be interpreted as a manifestly unphysical, singular IEP limit of a hypothetical one-parametric family of certain standard quantum Hamiltonians. For explanation, an ample use is made of perturbation theory and of multiple analogies between IEPs and conventional Kato's exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek scaling immune to anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior in driven open systems at the limit of loss difference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative quench dynamics in a family of two-band fermionic systems by linearly ramping the staggered on-site energy. In the Lindblad formalism, we present an analytical solution in the presence of uniform loss or loss difference on bipartite lattices, which tells that dissipation exponentially suppresses the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling behavior and the quantum jump term of the dissipation is responsible for the anti-KZ (AKZ) behavior. Interestingly, we find two different scaling behaviors at the limit of loss difference. Both scaling behaviors arise from the gapless Liouvillian. But one is accompanied by impulse stage rendered by the criticality of the system, so that it is ascribed to the universal KZ scaling law. Another depends on the dissipation strength and there is no impulse stage in it. We also point out a convenient way to observe the two new scaling behaviors by counting the number of residual particles in the end, since it is immune to the influence of AKZ behavior. We illustrate our findings through the prototypical one-dimensional Rice-Mele model first. Then, in the one-dimensional Shockley model and the two-dimensional Haldane model for Chern insulators, we show that the two scaling behaviors can appear together or separately with appropriate quench protocols.</description>

Abstract: Optically-addressable spin qubits form the foundation of a new generation of emerging nanoscale sensors. The engineering of these sensors has mainly focused on solid-state systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. However, NVs are restricted in their ability to interface with biomolecules due to their bulky diamond host. Meanwhile, fluorescent proteins have become the gold standard in bioimaging, as they are genetically encodable and easily integrated with biomolecules. While fluorescent proteins have been suggested to possess a metastable triplet state, they have not been investigated as qubit sensors. Here, we realize an optically-addressable spin qubit in the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) enabled by a novel spin-readout technique. A near-infrared laser pulse allows for triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 44% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the EYFP spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of $(141 \pm 5)\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, a $(16 \pm 2)\, \mathrm{\mu s}$ coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) decoupling, and a predicted oscillating (AC) magnetic field sensitivity with an upper bound of $183 \, \mathrm{fT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically-detected magnetic resonance at room temperature in aqueous solution with contrast up to 3%, and measure a static (DC) field sensitivity with an upper bound of $93 \, \mathrm{pT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Our results establish fluorescent proteins as a powerful new qubit sensor platform and pave the way for applications in the life sciences that are out of reach for solid-state technologies.</description>

      <title>Learning Feedback Mechanisms for Measurement-Based Variational Quantum State Preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a self-learning protocol that incorporates measurement and feedback into variational quantum circuits for efficient quantum state preparation. By combining projective measurements with conditional feedback, the protocol learns state preparation strategies that extend beyond unitary-only methods, leveraging measurement-based shortcuts to reduce circuit depth. Using the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state as a benchmark, the protocol learns high-fidelity state preparation by overcoming a family of measurement induced local minima through adjustments of parameter update frequencies and ancilla regularization. Despite these efforts, optimization remains challenging due to the highly non-convex landscapes inherent to variational circuits. The approach is extended to larger systems using translationally invariant ans\"atze and recurrent neural networks for feedback, demonstrating scalability. Additionally, the successful preparation of a specific AKLT state with desired edge modes highlights the potential to discover new state preparation protocols where none currently exist. These results indicate that integrating measurement and feedback into variational quantum algorithms provides a promising framework for quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Characterizing resources for multiparameter estimation of SU(2) and SU(1,1) unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We follow recent works analyzing precision bounds to the estimation of multiple parameters generated by a unitary evolution with non-commuting Hamiltonians that form a closed algebra. We consider the $3$-parameter estimation of SU(2) and SU(1,1) unitaries and investigate the scaling of the precision in a pragmatic framework where the estimation is performed via the so-called method of moments, consisting in the estimation of phases via expectation values of time-evolved observables, which we restrict to be the first two moments of the Hamiltonian generators. We consider optimal or close-to-optimal initial states, that can be obtained by maximizing the quantum Fisher information matrix, and analyze the maximal precision achievable from measuring only the first two moments of the generators. As a result, we find that in our context with limited resources accessible, the twin-Fock state emerges as the best probe state, that allows the estimation of two out of the three parameters with Heisenberg precision scaling. Moreover, in other practical scenarios with less limitations we identify useful probe states that can in principle achieve Heisenberg scaling for the three parameters considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a protocol for quantum computation that represents a model distinct from the circuit-based approach. MBQC has been proposed not only for qubits but also for qudits, continuous-variable (CV) qubits, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) qubits. In qubit-based MBQC, arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can be performed by measuring a graph state. This naturally raises the question of whether arbitrary rotations on the Bloch sphere can similarly be achieved through measurements in other types of quantum bits. We have demonstrated that this can indeed be realized for BECs qubits by considering composite graph states involving CV qubits and BECs qubits.</description>

      <title>Noise-Mitigated Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Pre-training and Zero-Noise Extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the variational quantum eigensolver is widely applied in quantum chemistry simulations, especially in computing the electronic structure of complex molecular systems. However, on existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, some factors such as quantum decoherence, measurement errors, and gate operation imprecisions are unavoidable. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an efficient noise-mitigating variational quantum eigensolver for accurate computation of molecular ground state energies in noisy environments. We design the quantum circuit with reference to the structure of matrix product states and utilize it to pre-train the circuit parameters, which ensures circuit stability and mitigates fluctuations caused by initialization. We also employ zero-noise extrapolation to mitigate quantum noise and combine it with neural networks to improve the accuracy of the noise-fitting function, which significantly eliminates noise interference. Furthermore, we implement an intelligent grouping strategy for measuring Hamiltonian Pauli strings, which not only reduces measurement errors but also improves sampling efficiency. We perform numerical simulations to solve the ground state energy of the $H_4$ molecule by using MindSpore Quantum framework, and the results demonstrate that our algorithm can constrain noise errors within the range of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$, outperforming mainstream variational quantum eigensolvers. This work provides a new strategy for high-precision quantum chemistry calculations on near-term noisy quantum hardware.

      <title>Topological quantum compilation of metaplectic anyons based on the genetic optimized algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum computing holding global anti-interference ability is realized by braiding some anyons, such as well-known Fibonacci anyons. Here, based on $SO(3)_2$ theory we obtain a total of 6 anyon models utilizing F-matrices, R-symbols, and fusion rules of metaplectic anyon.We obtain the elementary braided matrices (EBMs) by means of unconventional encoding. After braid $X$ and $X'$, we insert a pair of $Z$ anyons into they to ensure that the initial order of anyons remains unchanged. In this process only fusion is required, and measurement is not necessary. Three of them $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$ are studied in detail. We study systematically the compilation of these three models through EBMs obtained analytically. For one-qubit case, the classical H- and T-gate can be well constructed using the genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA) by $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$. The obtained accuracy of the H/T-gate by $\{V_3^{113}, V_1^{133}\}$ is slightly inferior to the corresponding gates of the Fibonacci anyon model, but it also can meet the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing, $V^3_131$ giving the best performance of these four models. For the two-qubit case, we use the exhaustive method for short lengths and the GA for long lengths to obtain braidword for $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$ models. The resulting matrices can well approximate the local equivalence class of the CNOT-gate, while demonstrating a much smaller error than the Fibonacci model, especially for the $V_3^{113}$.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation(QEM), an error suppression strategy without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum~(NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly been focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose a non-Markovian Noise Mitigation(NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions(BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that will make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on a spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement distribution in quantum networks will enable next-generation technologies for quantum-secured communications, distributed quantum computing and sensing. Future quantum networks will require dense connectivity, allowing multiple users to share entanglement in a reconfigurable and multiplexed manner, while long-distance connections are established through the teleportation of entanglement, or entanglement swapping. While several recent works have demonstrated fully connected, local multi-user networks based on multiplexing, extending this to a global network architecture of interconnected local networks remains an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate the next stage in the evolution of multiplexed quantum networks: a prototype global reconfigurable network where entanglement is routed and teleported in a flexible and multiplexed manner between two local multi-user networks composed of four users each. At the heart of our network is a programmable 8x8-dimensional multi-port circuit that harnesses the natural mode-mixing process inside a multi-mode fibre to implement on-demand high-dimensional operations on two independent photons carrying eight transverse-spatial modes. Our circuit design allows us to break away from the limited planar geometry and bypass the control and fabrication challenges of conventional integrated photonic platforms. Our demonstration showcases the potential of this architecture for enabling large-scale, global quantum networks that offer versatile connectivity while being fully compatible with an existing communications infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: Microscopic Schr{\"o}dinger cat states are generated from quantum correlated fields using a probabilistic heralding photon subtraction event. Subsequent quantum state tomography provides complete information about the state with typical photon numbers of the order of one. Another approach strives for a larger number of quantum-correlated photons by conditioning the measurement analysis on events with exactly this number of photons. Here, we present a new approach to derive measurement data of quantum correlated states with average quantum-correlated photon numbers significantly larger than one. We produce an ensemble of a heralded, photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state of light. We split the states at a balanced beam splitter and simultaneously measure a pair of orthogonal field quadratures at the outputs using tomographic `Q-function homodyne detection' (QHD). The final act is probabilistic two-copy data post-processing aiming for data from a new state with larger photon number. Evaluating the final tomographic data as that of a grown microscopic Schr{\"o}dinger cat state shows that the probabilistic post-processing increased the photon number of $|\alpha_0|^2 \approx 1.2$ to $|\alpha_2|^2 \approx 6.8$. Our concept for obtaining tomographic measurement data of mesoscopic non-classical states that never existed might be a turning point in measurement-based quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cage in Bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model optomechanical systems with photon-vibration interactions linear, quadratic, and cubic in mechanical displacements are studied under conditions for adiabatic elimination of the photon field. The opportunity of transformation of effective potential describing the dynamics of the mechanical resonator from single-well to double-well is demonstrated. The dynamics of the mechanical resonator is considered in the presence of (i) only linear interaction, (ii) only quadratic interaction, (iii) both linear and quadratic interactions, and (iv) all three interactions, while other parameters of the optomechanical system, the modulation optical field, and the initial conditions remain fixed. Quasiperiodic oscillations of the mechanical resonator in the case (i) are replaced by chaotic ones when the cases (ii) or (iii) are realized. It is interesting that in the presence of all three interactions, the chaotic behavior of the mechanical oscillator becomes quasi-periodic. However, increasing the power of the modulation field again leads to chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a noncommutative version of the Nullstellensatz, motivated by the study of quantum nonlocal games. It has been proved that a two-answer nonlocal game with a perfect quantum strategy also admits a perfect classical strategy. We generalize this result to the infinite-dimensional case, showing that a two-answer game with a perfect commuting operator strategy also admits a perfect classical strategy. This result induces a special case of noncommutative Nullstellensatz.</description>

Abstract: We explore covert communication of qubits over an arbitrary quantum channel. Covert communication conceals the transmissions in the channel noise, ensuring that an adversary is unable to detect their presence. We show the achievability of a $\textit{square root law}$ (SRL) for quantum covert communication similar to that for classical: $M(n)\propto\sqrt{n}$ qubits can be transmitted covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a general quantum channel. We lower bound $M(n)$ with and without assistance from a two-way covert classical channel. In the former case, we quantify the number of classical covert bits sufficient for our protocol.</description>

Abstract: We give an operational definition of information-theoretic resources within a given multipartite classical or quantum correlation. We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new implementation of many-body calculations is of paramount importance in the field of computational physics. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing. Our findings unambiguously highlight the significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel approaches to many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Lindblad quantum dynamics from correlation functions of classical spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we study the question whether the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we find a good accuracy of such a description for a range of model parameters, which is consistent with previous studies on closed systems. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment. We also point out counterexamples and limitations for the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients. Remarkably, our classical approach to large open systems allows to detect superdiffusion at the isotropic point.</description>

      <title>Learning local equivariant representations for quantum operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial for material science. Current methods often focus on individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (strictly localized equivariant message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based design for equivariant representations of quantum tensors while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependency without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution and invariant overlap parameterization, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$ orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data. SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence in neutrino spin-flavor oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherence, which represents the superposition of orthogonal states, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and can also be precisely defined within quantum resource theory. Thus exploring quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations can not only help in examining the intrinsic quantum nature but can also explore their potential applications in quantum information technologies. Previous studies on quantum coherence have focused on neutrino flavor oscillations (FO). However, FO imply that neutrinos have mass and this can lead to the generation of a tiny but finite magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos through quantum loop diagrams at higher orders of perturbative expansion of the interaction. This electromagnetic property of neutrinos can induce spin flavor oscillations (SFO) in the presence of an external magnetic field and hence is expected to enrich the study of coherence. In this work, we investigate quantum coherence in neutrino SFO with three flavor mixing within the interstellar as well as intergalactic magnetic fields, quantified by the $l_1$ norm and the relative entropy of coherence, and express these measures in terms of neutrino SFO probabilities. For FO, coherence measures can sustain higher values (say, within 50% of the maximum) over distances of several kilometers, which are relevant for terrestrial experiments like reactor and accelerator neutrinos. However, for SFO, we find that the coherence scale can extend to astrophysical distances, spanning from kiloparsecs to gigaparsecs.</description>

      <title>Feedback Intensity Equalization Algorithm for Multi-Spots Holographic Tweezer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High degree of adjustability enables the holographic tweezer array a versatile platform for creating an arbitrary geometrical atomic array. In holographic tweezer array experiments, an optical tweezer generated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) usually is used as a static tweezer array. However, the alternating current (AC) stark effect generally induces the intensity difference of traps in terms of different light shifts. So, intensity equalization is an essential prerequisite for preparing a many-body system with individually controlled atoms. Here, we report an intensity equalization algorithm. In particular, we observe the non-uniformity of the tweezer array is below 1.1% when the array size is larger than 1000. Our analysis shows that by optimizing the hardware performance of the optical system, this uniformity could be further improved. Our work offers the opportunities for large-scale quantum computation and simulation with reconfigurable atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that matter-wave diffraction off a single standing laser wave can be used as an accurate measurement scheme for photophysical molecular parameters. These include state-dependent optical polarizabilities and photon-absorption cross sections, the relaxation rates for fluorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, as well as ionization or cleavage probabilities. We discuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the interference pattern, and we determine the accuracy of molecular parameters estimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The analysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which accounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite longitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the gravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.</description>

      <title>Role of intermediate resonances in attosecond photoelectron interferometry in neon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond photoelectron interferometry based on the combination of an attosecond pulse train and a synchronized infrared field is a fundamental technique for the temporal characterization of attosecond waveforms and for the investigation of electron dynamics in the photoionization process. In this approach, the comb of extreme ultraviolet harmonics typically lies above the ionization threshold of the target under investigation, thus releasing a photoelectron by single-photon absorption. The interaction of the outgoing photoelectron with the infrared pulse results in the absorption or emission of infrared photons, thereby creating additional peaks in the photoelectron spectrum, referred to as sidebands. While, in the absence of resonances in the first ionization step, the phases imparted on the photoionization process evolve smoothly with the photon energy, the presence of intermediate resonances imprints a large additional phase on the outgoing photoelectron wave packet. In this work, using a comb of harmonics below and above the ionization threshold of neon, we investigate the effect of intermediate bound excited states on attosecond photoelectron interferometry. We show that the phase of the oscillations of the sidebands and their angular distributions are strongly affected by such resonances. By slightly tuning the photon energies of the extreme ultraviolet harmonics, we show how the contributions of selected resonances can be enhanced or suppressed.</description>

      <title>From scale-free to Anderson localization: a size-dependent transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale-free localization in non-Hermitian systems is a distinctive type of localization where the localization length of certain eigenstates, known as scale-free localized (SFL) states, scales proportionally with the system size. Unlike skin states, where the localization length is independent of the system size, SFL states maintain a spatial profile that remains invariant as the system size changes. We consider a model involving a single non-Hermitian impurity in an otherwise Hermitian one-dimensional lattice. Introducing disorder into this system transforms SFL states into Anderson-localized states. In contrast to the Hatano-Nelson model, where disorder typically leads to the localization of skin states and a size-independent Anderson transition, the scale-free localization in our model causes a size-dependent Anderson transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of information scrambling and decoherence in the integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of information scrambling, captured by out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), is a central indicator of the nature of many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we compute analytically the complete time dependence of the OTOC for an integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majoranas with random two-body interactions of infinite range, coupled to a Markovian bath at finite temperature. In the limit of no coupling to the bath, the time evolution of scrambling experiences different stages. For $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$, after an initial polynomial growth, the OTOC approaches saturation in a power-law fashion with oscillations superimposed. At $t \sim \sqrt{N}$, the OTOC reverses trend and starts to decrease linearly in time. The reason for this linear decrease is that, despite being a subleading $1/N$ effect, the OTOC in this region is governed by the spectral form factor of the antisymmetric couplings of the SYK model. The linear decrease stops at $t \sim 2N$, the Heisenberg time, where saturation occurs. The effect of the environment is an overall exponential decay of the OTOC for times longer than the inverse of the coupling strength to the bath. The oscillations at $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ indicate lack of thermalization -- a desired feature for a better performance of quantum information devices.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>Investigating Parameter-Efficiency of Hybrid QuGANs Based on Geometric Properties of Generated Sea Route Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for artificially generated data for the development, training and testing of new algorithms is omnipresent. Quantum computing (QC), does offer the hope that its inherent probabilistic functionality can be utilised in this field of generative artificial intelligence. In this study, we use quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial networks (QuGANs) to artificially generate graphs of shipping routes. We create a training dataset based on real shipping data and investigate to what extent QuGANs are able to learn and reproduce inherent distributions and geometric features of this data. We compare hybrid QuGANs with classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special focus on their parameter efficiency. Our results indicate that QuGANs are indeed able to quickly learn and represent underlying geometric properties and distributions, although they seem to have difficulties in introducing variance into the sampled data. Compared to classical GANs of greater size, measured in the number of parameters used, some QuGANs show similar result quality. Our reference to concrete use cases, such as the generation of shipping data, provides an illustrative example and demonstrate the potential and diversity in which QC can be used.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion with an integrated soft-ferroelectric barium titanate transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Robust Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, denoising, and visualization. The most commonly used principal component analysis method is based upon optimization of the L2-norm, however, the L2-norm is known to exaggerate the contribution of errors and outliers. When optimizing over the L1-norm, the components generated are known to exhibit robustness or resistance to outliers in the data. The L1-norm components can be solved for with a binary optimization problem. Previously, L1-BF has been used to solve the binary optimization for multiple components simultaneously. In this paper we propose QAPCA, a new method for finding principal components using quantum annealing hardware which will optimize over the robust L1-norm. The conditions required for convergence of the annealing problem are discussed. The potential speedup when using quantum annealing is demonstrated through complexity analysis and experimental results. To showcase performance against classical principal component analysis techniques experiments upon synthetic Gaussian data, a fault detection scenario and breast cancer diagnostic data are studied. We find that the reconstruction error when using QAPCA is comparable to that when using L1-BF.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state density of any non-interacting Schr\"odinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. This result together with recent results from [Sutter el al (2024), J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 475202] provides a complete characterization of the set of non-interacting v-representable densities on the torus. Moreover, we prove that, for said class of non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground-state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities. These results contribute to establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the Kohn-Sham scheme in this simplified setting.</description>

      <title>Topological $X$-states in a quantum impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological qubits are inherently resistant to noise and errors. However, experimental demonstrations have been elusive as their realization and control is highly complex. In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of topological $X$-states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator signifying the trapping of excitations, and hence information in local edge modes.</description>
