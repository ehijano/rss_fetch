      <title>Differentially Private Finite Population Estimation via Survey Weight Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, it is challenging to release differentially private versions of survey-weighted statistics with low error for acceptable privacy loss. This is because weighted statistics from complex sample survey data can be more sensitive to individual survey response and weight values than unweighted statistics, resulting in differentially private mechanisms that can add substantial noise to the unbiased estimate of the finite population quantity. On the other hand, simply disregarding the survey weights adds noise to a biased estimator, which also can result in an inaccurate estimate. Thus, the problem of releasing an accurate survey-weighted estimate essentially involves a trade-off among bias, precision, and privacy. We leverage this trade-off to develop a differentially private method for estimating finite population quantities. The key step is to privately estimate a hyperparameter that determines how much to regularize or shrink survey weights as a function of privacy loss. We illustrate the differentially private finite population estimation using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We show that optimal strategies for releasing DP survey-weighted mean income estimates require orders-of-magnitude less noise than naively using the original survey weights without modification.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Security Control Production With Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security controls are mechanisms or policies designed for cloud based services to reduce risk, protect information, and ensure compliance with security regulations. The development of security controls is traditionally a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. This paper explores the use of Generative AI to accelerate the generation of security controls. We specifically focus on generating Gherkin codes which are the domain-specific language used to define the behavior of security controls in a structured and understandable format. By leveraging large language models and in-context learning, we propose a structured framework that reduces the time required for developing security controls from 2-3 days to less than one minute. Our approach integrates detailed task descriptions, step-by-step instructions, and retrieval-augmented generation to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the generated Gherkin code. Initial evaluations on AWS cloud services demonstrate promising results, indicating that GenAI can effectively streamline the security control development process, thus providing a robust and dynamic safeguard for cloud-based infrastructures.</description>

      <title>EarCapAuth: Biometric Method for Earables Using Capacitive Sensing Eartips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earphones can give access to sensitive information via voice assistants which demands security methods that prevent unauthorized use. Therefore, we developed EarCapAuth, an authentication mechanism using 48 capacitive electrodes embedded into the soft silicone eartips of two earables. For evaluation, we gathered capactive ear canal measurements from 20 participants in 20 wearing sessions (12 at rest, 8 while walking). A per user classifier trained for authentication achieves an EER of 7.62% and can be tuned to a FAR (False Acceptance Rate) of 1% at FRR (False Rejection Rate) of 16.14%. For identification, EarCapAuth achieves 89.95%. This outperforms some earable biometric principles from related work. Performance under motion slightly decreased to 9.76% EER for authentication and 86.40% accuracy for identification. Enrollment can be performed rapidly with multiple short earpiece insertions and a biometric decision is made every 0.33s. In the future, EarCapAuth could be integrated into high-resolution brain sensing electrode tips.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Overview and Fundamental Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter is meant to be part of the book "Differential Privacy in Artificial Intelligence: From Theory to Practice" and provides an introduction to Differential Privacy. It starts by illustrating various attempts to protect data privacy, emphasizing where and why they failed, and providing the key desiderata of a robust privacy definition. It then defines the key actors, tasks, and scopes that make up the domain of privacy-preserving data analysis. Following that, it formalizes the definition of Differential Privacy and its inherent properties, including composition, post-processing immunity, and group privacy. The chapter also reviews the basic techniques and mechanisms commonly used to implement Differential Privacy in its pure and approximate forms.</description>

      <title>Attention Masks Help Adversarial Attacks to Bypass Safety Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent research advancements in adversarial attack methods, current approaches against XAI monitors are still discoverable and slower. In this paper, we present an adaptive framework for attention mask generation to enable stealthy, explainable and efficient PGD image classification adversarial attack under XAI monitors. Specifically, we utilize mutation XAI mixture and multitask self-supervised X-UNet for attention mask generation to guide PGD attack. Experiments on MNIST (MLP), CIFAR-10 (AlexNet) have shown that our system can outperform benchmark PGD, Sparsefool and SOTA SINIFGSM in balancing among stealth, efficiency and explainability which is crucial for effectively fooling SOTA defense protected classifiers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reverse Engineering: Investigating and Benchmarking Large Language Models for Vulnerability Analysis in Decompiled Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security experts reverse engineer (decompile) binary code to identify critical security vulnerabilities. The limited access to source code in vital systems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical Infrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary level. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after compilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor. This gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being said, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the significance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source code. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial semantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing vulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant datasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary code vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and multi-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and association with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872 samples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of (i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv) recovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently, we fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance increase of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and CodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally, using DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability classification task. Furthermore, we report improved performance in function name recovery and vulnerability description tasks.</description>

      <title>Scalable DP-SGD: Shuffling vs. Poisson Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new lower bounds on the privacy guarantee of the multi-epoch Adaptive Batch Linear Queries (ABLQ) mechanism with shuffled batch sampling, demonstrating substantial gaps when compared to Poisson subsampling; prior analysis was limited to a single epoch. Since the privacy analysis of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is obtained by analyzing the ABLQ mechanism, this brings into serious question the common practice of implementing shuffling-based DP-SGD, but reporting privacy parameters as if Poisson subsampling was used. To understand the impact of this gap on the utility of trained machine learning models, we introduce a practical approach to implement Poisson subsampling at scale using massively parallel computation, and efficiently train models with the same. We compare the utility of models trained with Poisson-subsampling-based DP-SGD, and the optimistic estimates of utility when using shuffling, via our new lower bounds on the privacy guarantee of ABLQ with shuffling.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Oblivious State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We put forth Oblivious State Preparation (OSP) as a cryptographic primitive that unifies techniques developed in the context of a quantum server interacting with a classical client. OSP allows a classical polynomial-time sender to input a choice of one out of two public observables, and a quantum polynomial-time receiver to recover an eigenstate of the corresponding observable -- while keeping the sender's choice hidden from any malicious receiver. We obtain the following results:
  - The existence of (plain) trapdoor claw-free functions implies OSP, and the existence of dual-mode trapdoor claw-free functions implies round-optimal (two-round) OSP.
  - OSP implies the existence of proofs of quantumness, test of a qubit, blind classical delegation of quantum computation, and classical verification of quantum computation.
  - Two-round OSP implies quantum money with classical communication, classically-verifiable position verification, and (additionally assuming classical FHE with log-depth decryption) quantum FHE.
  Several of these applications were previously only known via tailored LWE-based constructions, whereas our OSP-based constructions yield new results from a wider variety of assumptions, including hard problems on cryptographic group actions. Finally, towards understanding the minimal hardness assumptions required to realize OSP, we prove the following:
  - OSP implies oblivious transfer between one classical and one quantum party.
  - Two-round OSP implies public-key encryption with classical keys and ciphertexts.
  In particular, these results help to ''explain'' the use of public-key cryptography in the known approaches to establishing a ''classical leash'' on a quantum server. For example, combined with a result of Austrin et al. (CRYPTO 22), we conclude that perfectly-correct OSP cannot exist unconditionally in the (quantum) random oracle model.</description>

      <title>Towards Secured Smart Grid 2.0: Exploring Security Threats, Protection Models, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Defenses for Robust Conformal Prediction Against Adversarial Attacks in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to the reliability and safety of deep learning models, especially in critical domains such as medical imaging. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates conformal prediction with game-theoretic defensive strategies to enhance model robustness against both known and unknown adversarial perturbations. We address three primary research questions: constructing valid and efficient conformal prediction sets under known attacks (RQ1), ensuring coverage under unknown attacks through conservative thresholding (RQ2), and determining optimal defensive strategies within a zero-sum game framework (RQ3). Our methodology involves training specialized defensive models against specific attack types and employing maximum and minimum classifiers to aggregate defenses effectively. Extensive experiments conducted on the MedMNIST datasets, including PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and TissueMNIST, demonstrate that our approach maintains high coverage guarantees while minimizing prediction set sizes. The game-theoretic analysis reveals that the optimal defensive strategy often converges to a singular robust model, outperforming uniform and simple strategies across all evaluated datasets. This work advances the state-of-the-art in uncertainty quantification and adversarial robustness, providing a reliable mechanism for deploying deep learning models in adversarial environments.</description>

      <title>Anonymous Public-Key Quantum Money and Quantum Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information allows us to build quantum money schemes, where a bank can issue banknotes in the form of authenticatable quantum states that cannot be cloned or counterfeited. Similar to paper banknotes, in existing quantum money schemes, a banknote consists of an unclonable quantum state and a classical serial number, signed by bank. Thus, they lack one of the most fundamental properties cryptographers look for in a currency scheme: privacy. In this work, we first further develop the formal definitions of privacy for quantum money schemes. Then, we construct the first public-key quantum money schemes that satisfy these security notions. Namely, - Assuming existence of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and hardness of Learning with Errors (LWE), we construct a public-key quantum money scheme with anonymity against users and traceability by authorities.
  Since it is a policy choice whether authorities should be able to track banknotes or not, we also construct an untraceable money scheme from the same cryptographic assumptions, where no one (not even the authorities) can track banknotes.
  Further, we show that the no-cloning principle, a result of quantum mechanics, allows us to construct schemes, with security guarantees that are classically impossible, for a seemingly unrelated application: voting! - Assuming iO and LWE, we construct a universally verifiable quantum voting scheme with classical votes.
  Finally, as a technical tool, we introduce the notion of publicly rerandomizable encryption with strong correctness, where no adversary is able to produce a malicious ciphertext and a malicious randomness such that the ciphertext before and after rerandomization decrypts to different values! We believe this might be of independent interest. - Assuming LWE, we construct a (post-quantum) classical publicly rerandomizable encryption scheme with strong correctness.</description>

      <title>Experimental Secure Multiparty Computation from Quantum Oblivious Transfer with Bit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables collaborative computations across multiple users while preserving individual privacy, which has a wide range of applications in finance, machine learning and healthcare. Secure multiparty computation can be realized using oblivious transfer as a primitive function. In this paper, we present an experimental implementation of a quantum-secure quantum oblivious transfer (QOT) protocol using an adapted quantum key distribution system combined with a bit commitment scheme, surpassing previous approaches only secure in the noisy storage model. We demonstrate the first practical application of the QOT protocol by solving the private set intersection, a prime example of secure multiparty computation, where two parties aim to find common elements in their datasets without revealing any other information. In our experiments, two banks can identify common suspicious accounts without disclosing any other data. This not only proves the experimental functionality of QOT, but also showcases its real-world commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Verification of Neural Networks against Convolutional Perturbations via Parameterised Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for the efficient verification of neural networks against convolutional perturbations such as blurring or sharpening. To define input perturbations we use well-known camera shake, box blur and sharpen kernels. We demonstrate that these kernels can be linearly parameterised in a way that allows for a variation of the perturbation strength while preserving desired kernel properties. To facilitate their use in neural network verification, we develop an efficient way of convolving a given input with these parameterised kernels. The result of this convolution can be used to encode the perturbation in a verification setting by prepending a linear layer to a given network. This leads to tight bounds and a high effectiveness in the resulting verification step. We add further precision by employing input splitting as a branch and bound strategy. We demonstrate that we are able to verify robustness on a number of standard benchmarks where the baseline is unable to provide any safety certificates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution for verifying robustness against specific convolutional perturbations such as camera shake.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Continual Learning using Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the intersection of continual learning (CL) and differential privacy (DP). Crucially, continual learning models must retain knowledge across tasks, but this conflicts with the differential privacy requirement of restricting individual samples to be memorised in the model. We propose using pre-trained models to address the trade-offs between privacy and performance in a continual learning setting.More specifically, we present necessary assumptions to enable privacy-preservation and propose combining pre-trained models with parameter-free classifiers and parameter-efficient adapters that are learned under differential privacy. Our experiments demonstrate their effectiveness and provide insights into balancing the competing demands of continual learning and privacy.</description>

      <title>Cloning Games, Black Holes and Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04730</link>

Abstract: The no-cloning principle has played a foundational role in quantum information and cryptography. Following a long-standing tradition of studying quantum mechanical phenomena through the lens of interactive games, Broadbent and Lord (TQC 2020) formalized cloning games in order to quantitatively capture no-cloning in the context of unclonable encryption schemes.
  The conceptual contribution of this paper is the new, natural, notion of Haar cloning games together with two applications. In the area of black-hole physics, our game reveals that, in an idealized model of a black hole which features Haar random (or pseudorandom) scrambling dynamics, the information from infalling entangled qubits can only be recovered from either the interior or the exterior of the black hole -- but never from both places at the same time. In the area of quantum cryptography, our game helps us construct succinct unclonable encryption schemes from the existence of pseudorandom unitaries, thereby, for the first time, bridging the gap between "MicroCrypt" and unclonable cryptography. The technical contribution of this work is a tight analysis of Haar cloning games which requires us to overcome many long-standing barriers in our understanding of cloning games. Answering these questions provably requires us to go beyond existing methods (Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski and Wehner, New Journal of Physics 2013). In particular, we show a new technique for analyzing cloning games with respect to binary phase states through the lens of binary subtypes, and combine it with novel bounds on the operator norms of block-wise tensor products of matrices.</description>

      <title>Why quantum state verification cannot be both efficient and secure: a categorical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advantage of quantum protocols lies in the inherent properties of the shared quantum states. These states are sometimes provided by sources that are not trusted, and therefore need to be verified. Finding secure and efficient quantum state verification protocols remains a big challenge, and recent works illustrate trade-offs between efficiency and security for different groups of states in restricted settings. However, whether a universal trade-off exists for all quantum states and all verification strategies remains unknown. In this work, we instantiate the categorical composable cryptography framework to show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. Our findings show that the prevailing cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient and secure.</description>

      <title>Security and Privacy on Generative Data in AIGC: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of information technology. With AIGC, it can be effortless to generate high-quality data that is challenging for the public to distinguish. Nevertheless, the proliferation of generative data across cyberspace brings security and privacy issues, including privacy leakages of individuals and media forgery for fraudulent purposes. Consequently, both academia and industry begin to emphasize the trustworthiness of generative data, successively providing a series of countermeasures for security and privacy. In this survey, we systematically review the security and privacy on generative data in AIGC, particularly for the first time analyzing them from the perspective of information security properties. Specifically, we reveal the successful experiences of state-of-the-art countermeasures in terms of the foundational properties of privacy, controllability, authenticity, and compliance, respectively. Finally, we show some representative benchmarks, present a statistical analysis, and summarize the potential exploration directions from each of theses properties.</description>

      <title>A Security Risk Assessment Method for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based Applications: Three Industry Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed ledger technologies have gained significant attention and adoption in recent years. Despite various security features distributed ledger technology provides, they are vulnerable to different and new malicious attacks, such as selfish mining and Sybil attacks. While such vulnerabilities have been investigated, detecting and discovering appropriate countermeasures still need to be reported. Cybersecurity knowledge is limited and fragmented in this domain, while distributed ledger technology usage grows daily. Thus, research focusing on overcoming potential attacks on distributed ledgers is required. This study aims to raise awareness of the cybersecurity of distributed ledger technology by designing a security risk assessment method for distributed ledger technology applications. We have developed a database with possible security threats and known attacks on distributed ledger technologies to accompany the method, including sets of countermeasures. We employed a semi-systematic literature review combined with method engineering to develop a method that organizations can use to assess their cybersecurity risk for distributed ledger applications. The method has subsequently been evaluated in three case studies, which show that the method helps to effectively conduct security risk assessments for distributed ledger applications in these organizations.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Range Queries with Correlated Input Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a class of differentially private mechanisms for linear queries, in particular range queries, that leverages correlated input perturbation to simultaneously achieve unbiasedness, consistency, statistical transparency, and control over utility requirements in terms of accuracy targets expressed either in certain query margins or as implied by the hierarchical database structure. The proposed Cascade Sampling algorithm instantiates the mechanism exactly and efficiently. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that we achieve near-optimal utility, effectively compete with other methods, and retain all the favorable statistical properties discussed earlier.</description>

      <title>Gradient Cuff: Detecting Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models by Exploring Refusal Loss Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a prominent generative AI tool, where the user enters a query and the LLM generates an answer. To reduce harm and misuse, efforts have been made to align these LLMs to human values using advanced training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial jailbreak attempts aiming at subverting the embedded safety guardrails. To address this challenge, this paper defines and investigates the Refusal Loss of LLMs and then proposes a method called Gradient Cuff to detect jailbreak attempts. Gradient Cuff exploits the unique properties observed in the refusal loss landscape, including functional values and its smoothness, to design an effective two-step detection strategy. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and Vicuna-7B-V1.5) and six types of jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP, Base64, and LRL) show that Gradient Cuff can significantly improve the LLM's rejection capability for malicious jailbreak queries, while maintaining the model's performance for benign user queries by adjusting the detection threshold.</description>

      <title>Evaluating The Explainability of State-of-the-Art Machine Learning-based Online Network Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) which use machine learning (ML) models achieve high detection performance and accuracy while avoiding dependence on fixed signatures extracted from attack artifacts. However, there is a noticeable hesitance among network security experts and practitioners when it comes to deploying ML-based NIDSs in real-world production environments due to their black-box nature, i.e., how and why the underlying models make their decisions. In this work, we analyze state-of-the-art ML-based online NIDS models using explainable AI (xAI) techniques (e.g., TRUSTEE, SHAP). Using the explanations generated for the models' decisions, the most prominent features used by each NIDS model considered are presented. We compare the explanations generated across xAI methods for a given NIDS model as well as the explanations generated across the NIDS models for a given xAI method. Finally, we evaluate the vulnerability of each NIDS model to inductive bias (artifacts learnt from training data). The results show that: (1) some ML-based NIDS models can be better explained than other models, (2) xAI explanations are in conflict for most of the NIDS models considered in this work and (3) some NIDS models are more vulnerable to inductive bias than other models.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Large Language Models for DGA and DNS Exfiltration Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) are malicious techniques used by malware to dynamically generate seemingly random domain names for communication with Command &amp; Control (C&amp;C) servers. Due to the fast and simple generation of DGA domains, detection methods must be highly efficient and precise to be effective. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their proficiency in real-time detection tasks, making them ideal candidates for detecting DGAs. Our work validates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs for detecting DGAs and DNS exfiltration attacks. We developed LLM models and conducted comprehensive evaluation using a diverse dataset comprising 59 distinct real-world DGA malware families and normal domain data. Our LLM model significantly outperformed traditional natural language processing techniques, especially in detecting unknown DGAs. We also evaluated its performance on DNS exfiltration datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing cybersecurity measures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that empirically applies LLMs for DGA and DNS exfiltration detection.</description>

      <title>Towards evaluations-based safety cases for AI scheming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We sketch how developers of frontier AI systems could construct a structured rationale -- a 'safety case' -- that an AI system is unlikely to cause catastrophic outcomes through scheming. Scheming is a potential threat model where AI systems could pursue misaligned goals covertly, hiding their true capabilities and objectives. In this report, we propose three arguments that safety cases could use in relation to scheming. For each argument we sketch how evidence could be gathered from empirical evaluations, and what assumptions would need to be met to provide strong assurance. First, developers of frontier AI systems could argue that AI systems are not capable of scheming (Scheming Inability). Second, one could argue that AI systems are not capable of posing harm through scheming (Harm Inability). Third, one could argue that control measures around the AI systems would prevent unacceptable outcomes even if the AI systems intentionally attempted to subvert them (Harm Control). Additionally, we discuss how safety cases might be supported by evidence that an AI system is reasonably aligned with its developers (Alignment). Finally, we point out that many of the assumptions required to make these safety arguments have not been confidently satisfied to date and require making progress on multiple open research problems.</description>

      <title>Undermining Image and Text Classification Algorithms Using Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models are prone to adversarial attacks, where inputs can be manipulated in order to cause misclassifications. While previous research has focused on techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), there's limited exploration of GANs and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) in text and image classification models to perform adversarial attacks. Our study addresses this gap by training various machine learning models and using GANs and SMOTE to generate additional data points aimed at attacking text classification models. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to face recognition models, training a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and subjecting it to adversarial attacks with fast gradient sign perturbations on key features identified by GradCAM, a technique used to highlight key image characteristics CNNs use in classification. Our experiments reveal a significant vulnerability in classification models. Specifically, we observe a 20 % decrease in accuracy for the top-performing text classification models post-attack, along with a 30 % decrease in facial recognition accuracy. This highlights the susceptibility of these models to manipulation of input data. Adversarial attacks not only compromise the security but also undermine the reliability of machine learning systems. By showcasing the impact of adversarial attacks on both text classification and face recognition models, our study underscores the urgent need for develop robust defenses against such vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Finding dense sub-lattices as low-energy states of a Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice-based cryptography has emerged as one of the most prominent candidates for post-quantum cryptography, projected to be secure against the imminent threat of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) is to find the shortest non-zero vector in a given lattice. It is fundamental to lattice-based cryptography and believed to be hard even for quantum computers. We study a natural generalization of the SVP known as the $K$-Densest Sub-lattice Problem ($K$-DSP): to find the densest $K$-dimensional sub-lattice of a given lattice. We formulate $K$-DSP as finding the first excited state of a Z-basis Hamiltonian, making $K$-DSP amenable to investigation via an array of quantum algorithms, including Grover search, quantum Gibbs sampling, adiabatic, and Variational Quantum Algorithms. The complexity of the algorithms depends on the basis through which the input lattice is presented. We present a classical polynomial-time algorithm that takes an arbitrary input basis and preprocesses it into inputs suited to quantum algorithms. With preprocessing, we prove that $O(KN^2)$ qubits suffice for solving $K$-DSP for $N$ dimensional input lattices. We empirically demonstrate the performance of a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm $K$-DSP solver for low dimensions, highlighting the influence of a good preprocessed input basis. We then discuss the hardness of $K$-DSP in relation to the SVP, to see if there is reason to build post-quantum cryptography on $K$-DSP. We devise a quantum algorithm that solves $K$-DSP with run-time exponent $(5KN\log{N})/2$. Therefore, for fixed $K$, $K$-DSP is no more than polynomially harder than the SVP.</description>

      <title>Provable Mutual Benefits from Federated Learning in Privacy-Sensitive Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) allows data owners to train accurate machine learning models by benefiting from each others private datasets. Unfortunately, the model accuracy benefits of collaboration are often undermined by privacy defenses. Therefore, to incentivize client participation in privacy-sensitive domains, a FL protocol should strike a delicate balance between privacy guarantees and end-model accuracy. In this paper, we study the question of when and how a server could design a FL protocol provably beneficial for all participants. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of mutually beneficial protocols in the context of mean estimation and convex stochastic optimization. We also derive protocols that maximize the total clients' utility, given symmetric privacy preferences. Finally, we design protocols maximizing end-model accuracy and demonstrate their benefits in synthetic experiments.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Integrated Decision Gradients (IDG-DP) for Radar-based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human motion analysis offers significant potential for healthcare monitoring and early detection of diseases. The advent of radar-based sensing systems has captured the spotlight for they are able to operate without physical contact and they can integrate with pre-existing Wi-Fi networks. They are also seen as less privacy-invasive compared to camera-based systems. However, recent research has shown high accuracy in recognizing subjects or gender from radar gait patterns, raising privacy concerns. This study addresses these issues by investigating privacy vulnerabilities in radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems and proposing a novel method for privacy preservation using Differential Privacy (DP) driven by attributions derived with Integrated Decision Gradient (IDG) algorithm. We investigate Black-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) Models in HAR settings across various levels of attacker-accessible information. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed IDG-DP method by designing a CNN-based HAR model and rigorously assessing its resilience against MIAs. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of IDG-DP in mitigating privacy attacks while maintaining utility across all settings, particularly excelling against label-only and shadow model black-box MIA attacks. This work represents a crucial step towards balancing the need for effective radar-based HAR with robust privacy protection in healthcare environments.</description>
