      <title>Acoustic Probing of New Biomarkers for Rapid Sickle Cell Disease Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a critical global health issue, with high child mortality in low-resource regions. Early screening and diagnosis is essential for improving health outcomes, but conventional screening methods are unsuitable for widespread use due to the high costs of laboratory equipment. There is an urgent need for portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly point-of-care tools that can quickly assess blood health. Here, we explore two new biomarkers enabled by acoustic probing for rapid SCD screening: cell membrane stability from measuring red blood cell (RBC) lysis temperature in whole blood, and plasma protein concentration from measuring relative protein precipitation in blood plasma. Both biomarkers effectively differentiate healthy HbAA samples from pre-/no transfusion HbSS samples with high accuracy. Additionally, the RBC lysis biomarker can distinguish post-transfusion exchange HbSS samples with a lower percentage of sickled cells, indicating the potential to initially screen for milder forms of SCD as well as sickle cell trait.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in magnetoelectric electromagnetism and magnetoelectric meta-atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While in electromagnetism we have space-time symmetry, magnetoelectric (ME) processes are characterized by space-time symmetry breaking. Our goal is to show that quantum vacuum fields with both time reversal and space inversion symmetry breaking (so-called ME fields) can be observed in subwavelength regions of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The sources of ME fields are ME meta-atoms, subwavelength elements made of magnetic insulators, where the dynamical ME behavior is due to modulations and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization. The interaction between EM and ME systems occurs through virtual structures, ME virtual photons. Experimentally, ME quantum vacuum states can be detected in a microwave cavity. The topic of these studies concerns fundamental aspects of ME quantum electrodynamics (MEQED).</description>

      <title>A review on the Parameter Space Concept and its use for crystal structure determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review of the emerging crystal structure determination method Parameter Space Concept (PSC), which solves and refines either partial or complete crystal structures by mapping each experimental or theoretical observation as a geometric interpretation, bypassing the conventional Fourier inversion. The PSC utilizes only a few \xray (equivalently neutron) diffraction amplitudes or intensities and turns them into piecewise analytic hyper-surfaces, called isosurfaces, embedded in a higher-dimensional orthonormal Cartesian space (Parameter Space (PS)). It reformulates the crystal determination task into a geometric interpretation, searching for a common intersection point of different isosurfaces. The art of defining various kinds of isosurfaces, based on signs, amplitude or intensity values, normalized ratios, and ranking of reflections, offers multiple choices of adapting methods in PSC based on available experimental or theoretical observations. The elegance of PSC stems from one-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates, enabling the construction of full three-dimensional crystal structures by combining multiple projections. By these means, the user may explore homometric and non-homometric solutions within both centric and acentric structures with spatial resolution remarkably down to pm, even with a limited number of diffraction reflections. Having demonstrated the potential of PSC for various synthetic structures and exemplarily verified direct application to realistic crystals, the origin and development of PSC methods are coherently discussed in this review. Notably, this review emphasizes the theoretical foundations, computational strategies, and potential extensions of PSC, outlining the roadmap for future applications of PSC in the broader context of structure determination from experimental diffraction observations.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterization of targets in complex media using fingerprint matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo several scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes full blurring of the image. Here we describe a method for detecting, localizing and characterizing any scattering target embedded in a complex medium. We introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. When applied to the recorded reflection matrix, it provides a likelihood index of the target state. This state can be the position of the target for localization purposes, its shape for characterization or any other parameter that influences its response. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by performing proof-of-concept ultrasound experiments on elastic spheres buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension and on lesion markers, which are commonly used to monitor breast tumours, embedded in a foam mimicking soft tissue. Furthermore, we show how the fingerprint operator can be leveraged to characterize the complex medium itself by mapping the fibre architecture within muscle tissue. Our method is broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.</description>

      <title>Injection locking of GHz-frequency surface acoustic wave phononic crystal oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-noise gigahertz (GHz) frequencies sources are essential for applications in signal processing, sensing, and telecommunications. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator-based oscillators offer compact form factors and low phase noise due to their short mechanical wavelengths and high quality (Q) factors. However, their small footprint makes them vulnerable to environmental variation, resulting in their poor long-term frequency stability. Injection locking is widely used to suppress frequency drift of lasers and oscillators by synchronizing to an ultra-stable reference. Here, we demonstrate injection locking of a 1-GHz SAW phononic crystal oscillator, achieving 40-dB phase noise reduction at low offset frequencies and unperturbed low noise at large offset frequencies. Compared to a free-running SAW oscillator, which typically exhibits frequency drifts of several hundred hertz over minutes, the injection-locked oscillator reduces the frequency deviation to below 0.35 Hz. We also investigate the locking range and oscillator dynamics in the injection pulling region. The demonstrated injection-locked SAW oscillator could find applications in high-performance portable telecommunications and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound matrix imaging for 3D transcranial in vivo localization microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is usually limited by skull-induced attenuation and high-order aberrations. By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can also be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and nonionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-space wavefront manipulation devices have emerged as powerful platforms for advanced optical information systems. In response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information, optical multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable devices are being actively explored to the enhance system capacity. Among them, coarse-grained mechanically reconfigurable mechanism offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization models. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable system. We utilized the diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single/double focus, 60-channel single/multi-mode OAM beam generation were experimentally demonstrated using diffractive optical elements (DOEs). An equivalent connectivity law was formulated to improve model scalability. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve system capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>

      <title>Frequency-stable nanophotonic microcavities via integrated thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-deployable integrated photonic devices co-packaged with electronics will enable important applications such as optical interconnects, quantum information processing, precision measurements, spectroscopy, and microwave generation. Significant progress has been made over the past two decades on increasing the functional complexity of photonic chips. However, a critical challenge that remains is the lack of scalable techniques to overcome thermal perturbations arising from the environment and co-packaged electronics. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated scheme to monitor and stabilize the temperature of a high-Q microresonator on a Si-based chip, which can serve as a photonic frequency reference. Our approach relies on a thin-film metallic resistor placed directly above the microcavity, acting as an integrated resistance thermometer, enabling unique mapping of the cavity's absolute resonance wavelength to the thermometer's electrical resistance. Following a one-time calibration, the microresonator can be accurately and repeatably tuned to any desired absolute resonance wavelength using thermometry alone with a root-mean squared wavelength error of &lt;0.8 pm over a timespan of days. We frequency-lock a distributed feedback (DFB) laser to the microresonator and demonstrate a 48x reduction in its frequency drift, resulting in its center wavelength staying within +-0.5 pm of the mean over the duration of 50 hours in the presence of significant ambient fluctuations, outperforming many commercial DFB and wavelength-locker-based laser systems. Finally, we stabilize a soliton mode-locked Kerr comb without the need for photodetection, paving the way for Kerr-comb-based photonic devices that can potentially operate in the desired mode-locked state indefinitely.</description>
