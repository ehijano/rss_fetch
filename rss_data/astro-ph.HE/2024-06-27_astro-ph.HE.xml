      <title>Size matters: are we witnessing super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift black holes from JWST?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope of the Universe at $z\gtrsim 4$ have shown that massive black holes (MBHs) appear extremely overmassive compared to the local correlation for active galactic nuclei. In some cases, these objects might even reach half the stellar mass inferred for the galaxy. Understanding how such objects formed and grew to this masses has then become a big challenge for theoretical models, with different ideas ranging from heavy seed to super-Eddington accretion phases. Here, we take a different approach, and try to infer how accurate these MBH mass estimates are and whether we really need to revise our physical models. By considering how the emerging spectrum (both the continuum and the broad lines) of an accreting MBH changes close to and above the Eddington limit, we infer a much larger uncertainty in the MBH mass estimates relative to that of local counterparts, up to an order of magnitude, and a potential preference for lower masses and higher accretion rates, which i) move them closer to the local correlations, and ii) might indicate that we are witnessing for the first time a widespread phase of very rapid accretion.</description>

      <title>Correlated mid-infrared and X-ray outbursts in black hole X-ray binaries: A new route to discovery in infrared surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared (MIR; $\lambda\simeq3 - 10\mu$m) bands offer a unique window into understanding accretion and its interplay with jet formation in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). Although extremely difficult to observe from the ground, the NEOWISE time domain survey offers an excellent data set to study MIR variability when combined with contemporaneous X-ray data from the MAXI all-sky survey over a $\approx15$ yr baseline. Using a new forced photometry pipeline for NEOWISE data, we present the first systematic study of BHXRB MIR variability in outburst. Analyzing a sample of 16 sources detected in NEOWISE, we show variability trends in the X-ray hardness and MIR spectral index wherein i) the MIR bands are typically dominated by jet emission during the hard states, constraining the electron power spectrum index to $p \approx 1-4$ in the optically thin regime and indicating emitting regions of a few tens of gravitational radii when evolving towards a flat spectrum, ii) the MIR luminosity ($L_{IR}$) scales as $L_{IR}\propto L_X^{0.82\pm0.12}$ with the $2-10$ keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) in the hard state, consistent with its origin in a jet, and iii) the thermal disk emission dominates the soft state as the jet switches off and dramatically suppresses ($\gtrsim 10\times$) the MIR emission into a inverted spectrum ($\alpha\approx -1$, where $F_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$). We highlight a population of `mini' BHXRB outbursts detected in NEOWISE (including two previously unreported episodes in MAXI J1828-249) but missed in MAXI due to their faint fluxes or source confusion, exhibiting MIR spectral indices suggestive of thermal emission from a large outer disk. We highlight that upcoming IR surveys and the Rubin observatory will be powerful discovery engines for the distinctively large amplitude and long-lived outbursts of BHXRBs, as an independent discovery route to X-ray monitors.</description>

      <title>On the lack of X-ray pulsation in most neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated whether the lack of X-ray pulsations from most neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) could be due to the extension of their inner disc to the NS surface. To estimate the inner disc radii, we have employed the model, recently proposed to account for the torque reversals of LMXBs. In this model, the inner disc radius depends on the spin period as well as the dipole moment and the mass inflow rate of the disc. Our model results indicate that most LMXBs have mass accretion rates above the minimum critical rates required for the inner disc to reach down to the NS surface and thereby quench the pulsed X-ray emission. For most sources X-ray pulsations are allowed when the period decreases below a certain critical value. For the same parameters, the model is also consistent with the observed X-ray luminosity ranges of the individual accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs). The paucity of AMXPs compared to the majority population of non-pulsing LMXBs is explained, as well as the fact that AMXPs are transient sources.</description>

      <title>Links Between Optical and X-ray Light in Cygnus X-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the low mass X-ray binary Cyg X-2 for a total of 18 nights over two observing runs in July and September of 2006, using the Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Using discrete cross correlations, we found peaks occurring at near-zero lags in the flaring branch of the colour-colour diagram, which could signify reprocessing, in addition to an anti-correlation within the normal branch. When comparing optical flux to the system's placement on the Z track, two distinct behaviors were seen: (1) a state with no correlation, and (2) a multi-valued (horizontal and normal branches)/correlated (flaring branch) state. The correlation was the result of direct steps and more gradual falls to and from the flaring branch respectively. Finally, we modeled timed spectra with 64 second bins with an extended accretion disc corona model. We found that correlations occurred between the optical and the various fitted parameters, particularly the blackbody normalization (and blackbody radius by extension) in higher intensity regions. Despite this, the Z track location was found to be a far better predictor of physical parameters than the optical flux, with clean correlations seen in every branch of the Z track. Where optical correlations are found, the location on the Z track was a better predictor of optical flux than any individual physical parameter.</description>

      <title>Linear adiabatic analysis for general relativistic instability in primordial accreting supermassive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive stars of $\gtrsim 10^{5}\,M_\odot$ will eventually collapse directly to a black hole via the general relativistic (GR) instability. Such direct collapses of supermassive stars are thought to be a possible formation channel for supermassive black holes at $z &gt; 6$. In this work, we investigate the final mass of accreting Population III stars with constant accretion rates between $0.01$ and $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass by solving the differential equation for the general relativistic linear adiabatic radial pulsations. We find that models with accretion rates $\gtrsim 0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ experience the GR instability at masses depending on the accretion rates. The critical masses are larger for higher accretion rates, ranging from $8\times10^{4}\,M_\odot$ for $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to $\sim10^6\,M_\odot$ for $1000\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. The $0.05\,M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ model reaches the GR instability at the end of the core hydrogen burning. The higher mass models with the higher accretion rates reach the GR instability during the hydrogen burning stage.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a radio jet in the changing-look AGN 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-frequency (5-345 GHz) and multi-resolution radio observations of 1ES 1927+654, widely considered one of the most unusual and extreme changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGN). The source was first designated a CL-AGN after an optical outburst in late 2017 and has since displayed considerable changes in X-ray emission, including the destruction and rebuilding of the X-ray corona in 2019-2020. Radio observations prior to 2023 show a faint and compact radio source not unusual for radio-quiet AGN. Starting in February 2023, 1ES 1927+654 began exhibiting a radio flare with a steep exponential rise, reaching a peak 60 times previous flux levels, and has maintained this higher level of radio emission for nearly a year. The 5-23 GHz spectrum is broadly similar to gigahertz-peaked radio sources, which are understood to be young radio jets less than ~1000 years old. Recent high-resolution VLBA observations at 23.5 GHz now show resolved extensions on either side of the core, with a separation of 0.14 pc, consistent with a new and mildly relativistic bipolar outflow. A steady increase in the soft X-ray band (0.3-2 keV) concurrent with the radio may be consistent with jet-driven shocked gas, though further observations are needed to test alternate scenarios. This source joins a growing number of CL-AGN and tidal disruption events which show late-time radio activity, years after the initial outburst.</description>

      <title>Investigation into the origin of the soft excess in Ark 564 using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combined a principal component analysis (PCA) and spectroscopy to investigate the origin of the soft excess in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564 with XMM-Newton observations over a period of ten years. We find that the principal components in different epochs are very similar, suggesting stable variability patterns in this source. More importantly, although its spectra could be equally well fitted by the two soft excess models, simulations show that the principal components from the relativistically smeared reflection model match the data well. At the same time, the principal components from the warm corona model show significant inconsistency. This finding indicates that the soft excess in Ark 564 originates from the relativistically smeared reflection, rather than the Comptonization in the warm corona, thereby favoring the reflection origin or the "hybrid" origin of the soft excess. Furthermore, the presence of the narrow absorption features in the spectra suggests that the soft excess is unlikely to originate from absorptions due to possible outflowing winds. Our results indicate that the PCA coupled with spectral analysis is a promising approach to exploring the origin of the soft excess in active galactic nuclei (AGNs).</description>

      <title>X-ray observations of black hole sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray astronomy is closely related to the study of black hole sources. The discovery that some unseen objects, more massive than any degenerate star, emit huge amounts of X-rays helped accept the concept that back holes are present in X-ray binaries. The detection of copious amounts of highly variable X-rays helped the emergence of the paradigm that all Active Galactic Nuclei harboured a supermassive black hole. Since the bulk of the emission in these sources are in X-rays and X-rays are thought to be originating from regions closest to the black holes, it was expected that X-ray observations would yield significant inputs for our understanding of the physical phenomena happening close to black holes like the disk-jet connection and help measure many important parameters like the mass and spin of the black holes. I will trace the developments in this area for the past several decades and, noting the relatively limited success, stress the need for more sensitive measurements. I will highlight the recent X-ray polarisation measurements of the Galactic black hole candidate source Cygnus X-1 using the CZT Imager instrument of AstroSat and sketch possible future developments.</description>

      <title>Searching for the Signature of Fast Radio Burst by Swift/XRT X-ray Afterglow Light Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new type of cosmological transient, dubbed fast radio bursts (FRBs), was recently discovered. The source of FRBs is still unknown. One possible scenario of an FRB is the collapse of a spinning supra-massive neutron star. Zhang (2014) suggests that the collapse can happen shortly (hundreds to thousands of seconds) after the birth of supra-massive neutron stars. The signatures can be visible in X-ray afterglows of long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For instance, a sudden drop (decay index steeper than -3 to -9) from a shallow decay (decay index shallower than -1) in the X-ray afterglow flux can indicate the event. We selected the X-ray afterglow light curves with a steep decay after the shallow decay phase from the Swift/XRT GRB catalog. We analyzed when the decay index changed suddenly by fitting these light curves to double power-law functions and compared it with the onset of FRBs. We found none of our GRB samples match the onset of FRBs.</description>

      <title>The aspherical explosions of the 03fg-like Type Ia supernovae 2021zny and 2022ilv revealed by polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A peculiar subtype of Type Ia supernovae (SNe), 03fg-like (super-Chandrasekhar) SNe, show different observational properties from prototypical Type Ia SNe, typically having high luminosity at the light-curve peak, low expansion velocities, and strong carbon features. The origin of this class of Type Ia SNe has been actively debated. Recent nebular-phase infrared observations of the 03fg-like Type Ia SN 2022pul using the James Webb Space Telescope revealed large-scale asymmetries in the ejecta and the presence of the strong [Ne II] line at 12.81 $\mu$m, suggesting a violent merger of two white dwarfs as its origin. Polarimetry is another powerful tool to study overall ejecta asymmetries of spatially-unresolved SNe. Here, we aim to check the universality of the violent merger scenario as the origin of the 03fg-like Type Ia SNe, by studying their explosion geometries using polarimetry. In this letter, we present imaging-polarimetric observations of the two 03fg-like Type Ia SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv. SNe 2021zny and 2022ilv show high intrinsic polarization ($\sim1$ % -$\sim2$ %), which might be composed of multiple components with different polarization angles. This indicates that they have complex aspherical structures in their ejecta, supporting the violent merger scenario for their origin. Our observations provide the first clear evidence from polarimetry for such aspherical structures.</description>

      <title>A Potential Second Shutoff from AT2018fyk: An updated Orbital Ephemeris of the Surviving Star under the Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018dyk/ASASSN-18UL showed a rapid dimming event 500 days after discovery, followed by a re-brightening roughly 700 days later. It has been hypothesized that this behavior results from a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), such that prompt dimmings/shutoffs are coincident with the return of the star to pericenter and rebrightenings generated by the renewed supply of tidally stripped debris. This model predicted that the emission should shut off again around August of 2023. We report AT2018fyk's continued X-ray and UV monitoring, which shows an X-ray (UV) drop in flux by a factor of 10 (5) over a span of two months, starting 14 Aug 2023. This sudden change can be interpreted as the second emission shutoff, which 1) strengthens the rpTDE scenario for AT2018fyk, 2) allows us to constrain the orbital period to a more precise value of 1306$\pm$47 days, and 3) establishes that X-ray and UV/optical emission track the fallback rate onto this SMBH -- an often-made assumption that otherwise lacks observational verification -- and therefore the UV/optical lightcurve is powered predominantly by processes tied to X-rays. The second cutoff implies that another rebrightening should happen between May-Aug 2025, and if the star survived the second encounter, a third shutoff is predicted to occur between Jan-July 2027. Finally, low-level accretion from the less bound debris tail (which is completely unbound/does not contribute to accretion in a non-repeating TDE) can result in a faint X-ray plateau that could be detectable until the next rebrightening.</description>

      <title>TeV $\gamma$-ray emission near globular cluster Terzan 5 as a probe of cosmic ray transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays travelling through interstellar space have their propagation directions repeatedly scattered by fluctuating interstellar magnetic fields. The nature of this scattering is a major unsolved problem in astrophysics, one that has resisted solution largely due to a lack of direct observational constraints on the scattering rate. Here we show that very high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the globular cluster Terzan 5, which has unexpectedly been found to be displaced from the cluster, presents a direct probe of this process. We show that this displacement is naturally explained by cosmic rays accelerated in the bow shock around the cluster propagating a finite distance before scattering processes re-orient enough of them towards Earth to produce a detectable $\gamma$-ray signal. The angular distance between the cluster and the signal places tight constraints on the scattering rate, which we show are consistent with a model whereby scattering is primarily due to excitation of magnetic waves by the cosmic rays themselves. The analysis method we develop here will make it possible to use sources with similarly displaced non-thermal X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray signals as direct probes of cosmic ray scattering across a range of Galactic environments.</description>

      <title>H.E.S.S. observations of the 2021 periastron passage of PSR B1259-63/LS 2883</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system that hosts a pulsar in an eccentric orbit, with a 3.4 year period, around an O9.5Ve star. At orbital phases close to periastron passages, the system radiates bright and variable non-thermal emission. We report on an extensive VHE observation campaign conducted with the High Energy Stereoscopic System, comprised of ~100 hours of data taken from $t_p-24$ days to $t_p+127$ days around the system's 2021 periastron passage. We also present the timing and spectral analyses of the source. The VHE light curve in 2021 is consistent with the stacked light curve of all previous observations. Within the light curve, we report a VHE maximum at times coincident with the third X-ray peak first detected in the 2021 X-ray light curve. In the light curve -- although sparsely sampled in this time period -- we see no VHE enhancement during the second disc crossing. In addition, we see no correspondence to the 2021 GeV flare in the VHE light curve. The VHE spectrum obtained from the analysis of the 2021 dataset is best described by a power law of spectral index $\Gamma = 2.65 \pm 0.04_{\text{stat}}$ $\pm 0.04_{\text{sys}}$, a value consistent with the previous H.E.S.S. observations of the source. We report spectral variability with a difference of $\Delta \Gamma = 0.56 ~\pm~ 0.18_{\text{stat}}$ $~\pm~0.10_{\text{sys}}$ at 95% c.l., between sub-periods of the 2021 dataset. We also find a linear correlation between contemporaneous flux values of X-ray and TeV datasets, detected mainly after $t_p+25$ days, suggesting a change in the available energy for non-thermal radiation processes. We detect no significant correlation between GeV and TeV flux points, within the uncertainties of the measurements, from $\sim t_p-23$ days to $\sim t_p+126$ days. This suggests that the GeV and TeV emission originate from different electron populations.</description>

      <title>Timing and Scintillation Studies of Pulsars in Globular Cluster M3 (NGC 5272) with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the phase-connected timing solutions of all the five pulsars in globular cluster (GC) M3 (NGC 5272), namely PSRs M3A to F (PSRs J1342+2822A to F), with the exception of PSR M3C, from FAST archival data. In these timing solutions, those of PSRs M3E, and F are obtained for the first time. We find that PSRs M3E and F have low mass companions, and are in circular orbits with periods of 7.1 and 3.0 days, respectively. For PSR M3C, we have not detected it in all the 41 observations. We found no X-ray counterparts for these pulsars in archival Chandra images in the band of 0.2-20 keV. We noticed that the pulsars in M3 seem to be native. From the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) analysis of the M3A's and M3B's dynamic spectra, the scintillation timescale ranges from $7.0\pm0.3$ min to $60.0\pm0.6$ min, and the scintillation bandwidth ranges from $4.6\pm0.2$ MHz to $57.1\pm1.1$ MHz. The measured scintillation bandwidths from the dynamic spectra indicate strong scintillation, and the scattering medium is anisotropic. From the secondary spectra, we captured a scintillation arc only for PSR M3B with a curvature of $649\pm23 {\rm m}^{-1} {\rm mHz}^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Extragalactic Background Light with the MAGIC telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) is the accumulated light produced throughout the universe history, spanning the UV, optical, and IR spectral ranges and mostly originating from stars, directly or re-processed by dust. However, measuring the EBL total intensity (beyond the contribution of resolved discrete sources) is challenging due to its faintness compared to foreground diffuse light like zodiacal light. A possible technique exploits the Very High Energy (VHE) photons coming from sources at cosmological distances. VHE photons can interact with the EBL and produce electron-positron pairs, a process that leaves an imprint in the observed gamma-ray spectrum. Determining the EBL with this method requires assumptions on the intrinsic spectrum of the source, which can affect the robustness of EBL constraints. In this contribution, through the use of Monte Carlo simulations, and archival data of the MAGIC telescopes, we have studied the impact that the assumptions so far adopted in the literature have in the estimates of the EBL density, and how the use of more generic ones would modify the results. These studies can impact our understanding of the evolution of the Universe, gamma-ray propagation, and large-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Constraining gravitational-wave backgrounds from conversions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves ($f \gtrsim 1$ MHz) may provide a unique signature for the existence of exotic physics. The lack of current and future gravitational-wave experiments sensitive at those frequencies leads to the need of employing different indirect techniques. Notably, one of the most promising one is constituted by graviton-photon conversions in magnetic fields. In this work, we focus on conversions of a gravitational-wave background into photons inside the Milky-Way magnetic field, taking into account the state-of-the-art models for both regular and turbulent components. We discuss how graviton-to-photon conversions may lead to imprints in the cosmic photon background spectrum in the range of frequencies $f\sim10^{9}-10^{26}\,$Hz, where the observed photon flux is widely explained by astrophysics emission models. Hence, the absence of any significant evidence for a diffuse photon flux induced by graviton-photon conversions allows us to set stringent constraints on the gravitational-wave strain $h_c$, strengthening current astrophysical bounds by $\sim1-2$ orders of magnitude in the whole range of frequencies considered.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Detecting the Global HI-21cm Signal at uGMRT through the Gravitational Lensing by an isolated Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strength of the global HI-21cm signal is several orders of magnitude lower than the foreground and background noise and hence it is difficult to observe this signal at a given radio telescope. However, a few recent studies reported the detection of that signal at the radio band suggests the strength of this signal is somehow magnified. In this analysis, we study the prospects of detecting this global signal at different frequency bands of uGMRT where this global signal is supposed to be amplified through the strong gravitational lensing by an isolated neutron star located in a cosmological distance. Our study shows the effects of the lensing parameters on the observables of that amplified global signal and discusses its variation with the frequency bands considered here. We present a method to estimate the position and size of an isolated neutron star using the signal-to-noise ratio of that global signal supposed to be detected at different frequency bands of uGMRT. We discuss the scope of multi-messenger astronomy in the era of HI-21cm observation where the estimated lensing parameters can be cross-validated using the pulsar detection at the X-ray band from the same location in the sky. Our analysis is equally applicable to any radio telescope with given specifications.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (II) Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) We analyze the emission of axion quark nuggets in a large sample of 161 simulated galaxy clusters using the SLOW simulation. These clusters are divided into a sub-sample of 150 galaxy clusters, ordered in five mass bins ranging from $0.8$ to $31.7 \times 10^{14} \,M_\odot$, along with 11 cross-identified galaxy clusters from observations. We investigate dark matter-baryonic matter interactions in galaxy clusters in their present stage at redshift $z=0$ by assuming all dark matter consists of axion quark nuggets. The resulting electromagnetic signatures are compared to thermal Bremsstrahlung and non-thermal cosmic ray synchrotron emission in each galaxy cluster. We further investigate individual frequency bands imitating the observable range of the WMAP, Planck, Euclid, and XRISM telescopes for the most promising cross-identified galaxy clusters hosting detectable signatures of axion quark nugget emission. We propose that the Fornax and Virgo clusters represent the most promising candidates to search for axion quark nugget emission signatures.</description>

      <title>NEOWISE-R Caught the Luminous SN 2023ixf in Messier 101</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reactivated Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE-R) serendipitously caught the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101 on the rise, starting day 3.6 through day 10.9, and on the late-time decline from days 211 through 213 and days 370 through 372. We have considered these mid-infrared (mid-IR) data together with observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the near-IR, when possible. At day 3.6 we approximated the optical emission with a hot, ~26,630 K blackbody, with a notable UV excess likely from strong SN shock interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM). In the IR, however, a clear excess is also obvious, and we fit it with a cooler, ~1,620 K blackbody with radius of ~2.6 x 10^{15} cm, consistent with dust in the progenitor's circumstellar shell likely heated by the UV emission from the CSM interaction. On day 10.8, the light detected was consistent with SN ejecta-dominated emission. At late times we also observed a clear NEOWISE-R excess, which could arise either from newly formed dust in the inner ejecta or in the contact discontinuity between the forward and reverse shocks, or from more distant pre-existing dust grains in the SN environment. Furthermore, the large 4.6 micron excess at late times can also be explained by the emergence of the carbon monoxide 1--0 vibrational band. SN 2023ixf is the best-observed SN IIP in the mid-IR during the first several days after explosion and one of the most luminous such SNe ever seen.</description>

      <title>Searching anomalies using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. One of the events could potentially come from a white dwarf. Some of them may originate from stellar flares, lightning, or be true anomalies, which are currently of an unknown type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a modification of general relativity proposed to explain galactic and cosmological mass discrepancies conventionally attributed to dark matter. The theory is able to fit the cosmic microwave background and the linear matter power spectrum without dark matter. In this work, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in this theory and solve it for realistic nuclear equations of state to predict the mass-radius relation of neutron stars. We find solutions that are compatible with all current observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>New high-precision measurement system for electron-positron pairs from sub-GeV/GeV gamma-rays in the emulsion telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GRAINE project observes cosmic gamma-rays, using a balloon-borne emulsion-film-based telescope in the sub-GeV/GeV energy band. We reported in our previous balloon experiment in 2018, GRAINE2018, the detection of the known brightest source, Vela pulsar, with the highest angular resolution ever reported in an energy range of $&gt;$80 MeV. However, the emulsion scanning system used in the experiment was designed to achieve a high-speed scanning, and it was not accurate enough to ensure the optimum spacial resolution of the emulsion film and limited the performance. Here, we report a new high-precision scanning system that can be used to greatly improve the observation result of GRAINE2018 and also be employed in future experiments. The system involves a new algorithm that recognizes each silver grain on an emulsion film and is capable of measuring tracks with a positional resolution for the passing points of tracks of almost the same as the intrinsic resolution of nuclear emulsion film ($\sim$70 nm). This resolution is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained with the high-speed scanning system. With this system, an angular resolution for gamma-rays of 0.1$^\circ$ at 1 GeV is expected to be achieved. Furthermore, we successfully combine the new high-precision system with the existing high-speed system, establishing the system to make a high-speed and high-precision measurement. Employing these systems, we reanalyze the gamma-ray events detected previously by only the high-speed system in GRAINE2018 and obtain an about three times higher angular resolution (0.22$^\circ$) in 500--700 MeV than the original value. The high-resolution observation may bring new insights into the gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center region and may realize polarization measurements of high-energy cosmic gamma-rays.</description>

      <title>Strong wave turbulence in strongly local large $N$ theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave turbulence in systems with two special properties: a large number of fields (large $N$) and a nonlinear interaction that is strongly local in momentum space. The first property allows us to find the kinetic equation at all interaction strengths -- both weak and strong, at leading order in $1/N$. The second allows us to turn the kinetic equation -- an integral equation -- into a differential equation. We find stationary solutions for the occupation number as a function of wave number, valid at all scales. As expected, on the weak coupling end the solutions asymptote to Kolmogorov-Zakharov scaling. On the strong coupling end, they asymptote to either the widely conjectured generalized Phillips spectrum (also known as critical balance), or a Kolmogorov-like scaling exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High resolution infrared data has revealed several young stars in close proximity to Sgr A*. These stars may encounter extremely high dark matter densities. We examine scenarios where dark matter scatters on stellar gas, accumulates in stellar cores, and then annihilates. We study the stars S2, S62, S4711 and S4714 and find three observable effects. First, dark matter interactions can inhibit in situ star-formation close to Sgr A*, favoring scenarios where these stars migrate into the Galactic Center. Second, dark matter interactions can delay main sequence evolution, making stars older than they appear. Third, very high dark matter densities can inject enough energy to disrupt main sequence stars, allowing S-star observations to constrain the dark matter density near Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Indications of an offset merger in Abell 3667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abell 3667 is a nearby merging cluster with a prominent cold front and a pair of two bright radio relics. Assuming a head-on merger, the origin of the cold front is often considered to be a remnant of the cluster core stripped by its surrounding ICM. Some authors have proposed an offset merger scenario in which the subcluster core rotates after the first core crossing. This scenario can reproduce features such as the cold front and a pair of radio relics. To distinguish between these scenarios, we reanalyzed the ICM distribution and measured the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity using the XMM-Newton PN data. In the unsharp masked image, we identify several ICM features. The notable feature is a RG1 vortex, which is a clockwise vortex-like enhancement with a radius of about 250 kpc connecting the first BCG to the radio galaxy (RG1). It is particularly enhanced near the north of the 1st BCG, which is named the BCG-N tail. The thermodynamic maps show that the ICM of the RG1 vortex has a relatively high abundance of 0.5-0.6 solar compared to the surrounding regions. The ICM of the BCG-E tail also has a high abundance and low pseudo-entropy and can be interpreted as a remnant of the cluster core's ICM. Including its arc-like shape, the RG1 vortex supports the idea that the ICM around the cluster center is rotating, which is natural for an offset merger scenario. The results of the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity measurements show that the ICM around the BCG-N tail is redshifted with a velocity difference of 940+/-440 km/s compared to the optical redshift of the first BCG. We obtain other indications of variations in the line-of-sight velocity of the ICM and discuss these in the context of an offset merger.</description>

Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r &lt; 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.</description>

      <title>Interaction of an outflow with surrounding gaseous clouds as the origin of the late-time radio flares in TDEs</title>

Abstract: Close encounter between a star and a supermassive black hole (SMBH) results in the tidal disruption of the star, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). Recently, a few TDEs, e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT2018hyz, have shown late-time (hundreds of days after their UV/optical peaks) radio flares with radio luminosities of $10^{38\sim39}$ erg/s. The super-Eddington fallback or accretion in a TDE may generate a mass outflow. Here we investigate a scenario that the late-time radio flares come from the interaction of the outflow with the circum-nuclear gaseous clouds, in addition to the slow-evolving emission component due to the outflow-diffuse medium interaction. We calculate the associated radio temporal and spectral signatures and find that they reproduce well the observations. The outflows have the inferred velocity of 0.2$\sim0.8$ c, the total mass of $10^{-3}\sim10^{-1}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and the ejection duration of a month to a year. The distances of the clouds to the SMBH are $0.1\sim1$ pc. This scenario has advantages in explaining the long delay, sharpness of the rise and the multiplicity of the late radio flares. Future observations may build up a much larger sample of late-time radio flares and enable their use as a probe of the TDE physics and the host circumnuclear environment.</description>

      <title>HI and CO spectroscopy of the unusual host of GRB 171205A: A grand design spiral galaxy with a distorted HI field</title>

Abstract: GRBs produced by the collapse of massive stars are usually found near the most prominent star-forming regions of star-forming galaxies. GRB 171205A happened in the outskirts of a spiral galaxy, a peculiar location in an atypical GRB host. In this paper we present a highly-resolved study of the molecular gas of this host, with CO(1-0) observations from ALMA. We compare with GMRT atomic HI observations, and with data at other wavelengths to provide a broad-band view of the galaxy. The ALMA observations have a spatial resolution of 0.2" and a spectral resolution of 10 km/s, observed when the afterglow had a flux density of ~53 mJy. This allowed a molecular study both in emission and absorption. The HI observations allowed to study the host galaxy and its extended environment. The CO emission shows an undisturbed spiral structure with a central bar, and no significant emission at the location of the GRB. Our CO spectrum does not reveal any CO absorption, with a column density limit of &lt; 10^15 cm^-2. This argues against the progenitor forming in a massive molecular cloud. The molecular gas traces the galaxy arms with higher concentration in the regions dominated by dust. The HI gas does not follow the stellar light or the molecular gas and is concentrated in two blobs, with no emission towards the centre of the galaxy, and is slightly displaced towards the southwest of the galaxy, where the GRB exploded. Within the extended neighbourhood of the host galaxy, we identify another prominent HI source at the same redshift, at a projected distance of 188 kpc. Our observations show that the progenitor of this GRB is not associated to a massive molecular cloud, but more likely related to low-metallicity atomic gas. The distortion in the HI gas field is indicator of an odd environment that could have triggered star formation and could be linked to a past interaction with the companion galaxy.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the origin of Short Gamma ray Bursts with or without extended emission</title>

Abstract: The merger of compact binary stars produces short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), involving channels such as neutron star - neutron star (BNS) and neutron star - black hole (NS-BH). The association between sGRB 170817A and gravitational wave GW 170817 provides reliable evidence for the BNS channel. The spatial distribution and merger rate differ between BNS mergers and NS-BH mergers. Some speculations suggest that sGRBs with extended emission (EE) may represent another distinct population. We compared the offset distributions of these two types of samples and found that they follow the same distribution. Utilizing non-parametric methods, we investigated the origin of these burst types in terms of their formation rate. We examined the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without any assuming. The luminosity function can be described as $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.09 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.57 \pm 0.02}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for standard sGRBs and $\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.11 \pm 0.004}$ for $L_{0} &lt; L_0^b$ ($\psi(L_{0}) \propto L_{0}^{-0.61 \pm 0.01}$ for $L_{0} &gt; L_0^b$) for sGRBs with EE. The formation rate is characterized as $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.21 \pm 0.22}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.22 \pm 0.74}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$ for standard sGRBs, while for sGRBs with EE, it is $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-4.30 \pm 0.13}$ for $z &lt; 0.8$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1 + z)^{-0.33 \pm 0.66}$ for $0.8 &lt; z &lt; 3$. Based on these findings, we suggest that there is no significant difference in the progenitor stars of sGRBs with and without EE, considering the spatial offset and formation rate perspectives.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Direct Detection of Black Hole Formation in Neutron Star Mergers with Next-Generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A direct detection of black hole formation in neutron star mergers would provide invaluable information about matter in neutron star cores and finite temperature effects on the nuclear equation of state. We study black hole formation in neutron star mergers using a set of 190 numerical relativity simulations consisting of long-lived and black-hole-forming remnants. The postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum of a long-lived remnant has greatly reduced power at a frequency $f$ greater than $f_{\rm peak}$, for $f \gtrsim 4\,\rm kHz$, with $f_{\rm peak} \in [2.5, 4]\,\rm kHz$. On the other hand, black-hole-forming remnants exhibit excess power in the same large $f$ region and manifest exponential damping in the time domain characteristic of a quasinormal mode. We demonstrate that the gravitational-wave signal from a collapsed remnant is indeed a quasinormal ringing. We report on the opportunity for direct detections of black hole formation with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope and set forth the tantalizing prospect of such observations up to a distance of 100 Mpc for an optimally oriented and located source with an SNR of 4.</description>

      <title>Binary mergers in the centers of galaxies: synergy between stellar flybys and tidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic centers are very dynamically active environments, often harbouring a nuclear star cluster and supermassive black hole at their cores. Binaries in these environments are subject to strong tidal fields that can efficiently torque its orbit, exciting near unity eccentricities that ultimately lead to their merger. In turn, frequent close interactions with passing stars impulsively perturb the orbit of the binary, generally softening their orbit until their evaporation, potentially hindering the role of tides to drive these mergers. In this work, we study the evolution of compact object binaries in the galactic center and their merger rates, focusing for the first time on the combined effect of the cluster's tidal field and flyby interactions. We find a significant synergy between both processes, where merger rates increase by a factor of ~10-30 compared to models in which only flybys or tides are taken into account. This synergy is a consequence of the persistent tides-driven eccentricity excitation that is enhanced by the gradual diffusion of $j_z$ driven by flybys. The merger efficiency peaks when the diffusion rate is ~10-100 slower than the tides-driven torquing. Added to this synergy, we also find that the gradual softening of the binary can lift the relativistic quenching of initially tight binaries, otherwise unable to reach extreme eccentricities, and thus expanding the available phase-space for mergers. Cumulatively, we conclude that despite the gradual softening of binaries due to flybys, these greatly enhance their merger rates in galaxy centers by promoting the tidal field-driven eccentricity excitation.</description>

      <title>Testing the isotropy of cosmic acceleration with Pantheon+ and SH0ES: A cosmographic analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a recent Pantheon+SH0ES compilation of Type Ia Supernova distance measurements at low-redshift, i.e., $0.01 \leq z \leq 0.10$, in order to investigate the directional dependency of the deceleration parameter ($q_0$) in different patches ($60^{\circ}$ size) across the sky, as a probe of the statistical isotropy of the Universe. We adopt a cosmographic approach to compute the cosmological distances, fixing $H_0$ and $M_B$ to reference values provided by the collaboration. By looking at 500 different patches randomly taken across the sky, we find a maximum $\sim 3\sigma$ CL anisotropy level for $q_0$, whose direction points orthogonally to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole axis, i.e., $(RA^{\rm SN},DEC^{\rm SN}) = (267^{\circ},6^{\circ})$ vs $(RA^{\rm CMB},DEC^{\rm CMB}) = (167^{\circ},-7^{\circ})$. We assessed the statistical significance of those results, finding that such a signal is expected due to the limitations of the observational sample. These results support that there is no significant evidence for a departure from the cosmic isotropy assumption, one of the pillars of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating as a discriminator for horizons in equatorial eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal heating in a binary black hole system is driven by the absorption of energy and angular momentum by the black hole's horizon. Previous works have shown that this phenomenon becomes particularly significant during the late stages of an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) into a rapidly spinning massive black hole, a key focus for future low-frequency gravitational-wave observations by (for instance) the LISA mission. Past analyses have largely focused on quasi-circular inspiral geometry, with some of the most detailed studies looking at equatorial cases. Though useful for illustrating the physical principles, this limit is not very realistic astrophysically, since the population of EMRI events is expected to arise from compact objects scattered onto relativistic orbits in galactic centers through many-body events. In this work, we extend those results by studying the importance of tidal heating in equatorial EMRIs with generic eccentricities. Our results suggest that accurate modeling of tidal heating is crucial to prevent significant dephasing and systematic errors in EMRI parameter estimation. We examine a phenomenological model for EMRIs around exotic compact objects by parameterizing deviations from the black hole picture in terms of the fraction of radiation absorbed compared to the BH case. Based on a mismatch calculation we find that reflectivities as small as $|\mathcal{R}|^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ are distinguishable from the BH case, irrespective of the value of the eccentricity. We stress, however, that this finding should be corroborated by future parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of magnetohydrodynamic modes in the ISM through synchrotron polarization statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in understanding Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is identifying the plasma mode components from observational data. Previous studies on synchrotron polarization from the interstellar medium (ISM) suggest that the dominant MHD modes can be identified via statistics of Stokes parameters, which would be crucial for studying various ISM processes such as the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation, dynamo. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the Synchrotron Polarization Analysis (SPA) method through systematic investigation of the statistical properties of the Stokes parameters. We derive the theoretical basis for our method from the fundamental statistics of MHD turbulence, recognizing that the projection of the MHD modes allows us to identify the modes dominating the energy fraction from synchrotron observations. Based on the discovery, we revise the SPA method using synthetic synchrotron polarization observations obtained from 3D ideal MHD simulations with a wide range of plasma parameters and driving mechanisms, and present a modified recipe for mode identification. We propose a classification criterion based on a new SPA+ fitting procedure, which allows us to distinguish between Alfv\'en mode and compressible/slow mode dominated turbulence. We further propose a new method to identify fast modes by analyzing the asymmetry of the SPA+ signature and establish a new asymmetry parameter to detect the presence of fast mode turbulence. Additionally, we confirm through numerical tests that the identification of the compressible and fast modes is not affected by Faraday rotation in both the emitting plasma and the foreground.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geodesic scattering of a test particle off a Schwarzschild black hole can be parameterized by the speed-at-infinity $v$ and the impact parameter $b$, with a "separatrix", $b=b_c(v)$, marking the threshold between scattering and plunge. Near the separatrix, the scattering angle diverges as $\sim\log(b-b_c)$. The self-force correction to the scattering angle (at fixed $v,b$) diverges even faster, like $\sim A_1(v)b_c/(b-b_c)$. Here we numerically calculate the divergence coefficient $A_1(v)$ in a scalar-charge toy model. We then use our knowledge of $A_1(v)$ to inform a resummation of the post-Minkowskian expansion for the scattering angle, and demonstrate that the resummed series agrees remarkably well with numerical self-force results even in the strong-field regime. We propose that a similar resummation technique, applied to a mass particle subject to a gravitational self-force, can significantly enhance the utility and regime of validity of post-Minkowskian calculations for black-hole scattering.</description>
