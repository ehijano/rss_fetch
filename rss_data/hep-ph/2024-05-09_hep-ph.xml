      <title>Local Sum Rules for 5D Braneworlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the consistency of field localization in 5D braneworld scenarios. We derive tensorial consistency relations, Local Sum Rules, which impose constraints on braneworld models featuring quasi-localized bulk fields. We apply these Local Sum Rules to simple cases involving massless scalar, vector, and spinor fields. Our analysis reveals that, when accounting for the effects of the Einstein equations on the bulk field, the free vector and spinor modes cannot be localized on the brane without the introduction of special mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Relic Neutrino Background from Cosmic-Ray Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the flux of relic neutrino background (R$\nu$B) up-scattered by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters that act as CR-reservoirs. The long trapping times of UHECRs make this flux larger than that of R$\nu$B up-scattered by UHECRs on their way to Earth, which we also compute. We find that IceCube excludes R$\nu$B weighted overdensities larger than $10^{10}$ in clusters, and that PUEO, RNO-G, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 will test values down to $10^{8}$. Our treatment incorporates the momentum transfer dependence of the neutrino-nucleus cross section, deep inelastic scattering, a mixed UHECR composition, and flavour information on the up-scattered R$\nu$B fluxes for both cases of neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering, providing new handles to possibly disentangle the up-scattered R$\nu$B from cosmogenic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number -flavor separation in the topological expansion of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge invariance of QCD dictates the presence of string junctions in the wave functions of baryons. In high-energy inclusive processes, these baryon junctions have been predicted to induce the separation of the flows of baryon number and flavor. In this paper we describe this phenomenon using the analog-gas model of multiparticle production proposed long time ago by Feynman and Wilson and adapted here to accommodate the topological expansion in QCD. In this framework, duality arguments suggest the existence of two degenerate junction-antijunction glueball Regge trajectories of opposite $\cal{C}$-parity with intercept close to 1/2. The corresponding results for the energy and rapidity dependence of baryon stopping are in reasonably good agreement with recent experimental findings from STAR and ALICE experiments. We show that accounting for correlations between the fragmenting strings further improves agreement with the data, and outline additional experimental tests of our picture at the existing (RHIC, LHC, JLab) and future (EIC) facilities.</description>

      <title>Top-down and bottom-up: Studying the SMEFT beyond leading order in $1/\Lambda^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to assess the relevance of higher order terms in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) expansion we consider four new physics models and their impact on the Drell Yan cross section. Of these four, one scalar model has no effect on Drell Yan, a model of fermions while appearing to generate a momentum expansion actually belongs to the vacuum expectation value expansion and so has a nominal effect on the process. The remaining two, a leptoquark and a Z' model exhibit a momentum expansion. After matching these models to dimension-ten we study how the inclusion of dimension-eight and dimension-ten operators in hypothetical effective field theory fits to the full ultraviolet models impacts fits. We do this both in the top-down approach, and in a very limited approximation to the bottom up approach of the SMEFT to infer the impact of a fully general fit to the SMEFT. We find that for the more weakly coupled models a strictly dimension-six fit is sufficient. In contrast when stronger interactions or lighter masses are considered the inclusion of dimension-eight operators becomes necessary. However, their Wilson coefficients perform the role of nuisance parameters with best fit values which can differ statistically from the theory prediction. In the most strongly coupled theories considered (which are already ruled out by data) the inclusion of dimension-ten operators allows for the measurement of dimension-eight operator coefficients consistent with theory predictions and the dimension-ten operator coefficients then behave as nuisance parameters. We also study the impact of the inclusion of partial next order results, such as dimension-six squared contributions, and find that in some cases they improve the convergence of the series while in others they hinder it.</description>

      <title>A Dissipative Dark Cosmology: From Early Matter Dominance to Delayed Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel mechanism for producing dark compact objects and black holes through a dark sector, where all the dark matter can be dissipative. Heavy dark sector particles with masses above $10^4$ GeV can come to dominate the Universe and yield an early matter-dominated era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Density perturbations in this epoch can grow and collapse into tiny dark matter halos, which cool via self interactions. The typical halo size is set by the Hubble length once perturbations begin growing, offering a straightforward prediction of the halo size and evolution depending on ones choice of dark matter model. Once these primordial halos have formed, a thermal phase transition can then shift the Universe back into radiation domination and standard cosmology. These halos can continue to collapse after BBN, resulting in the late-time formation of fragmented dark compact objects and sub-solar mass primordial black holes. We find that these compact objects can constitute a sizable fraction of all of dark matter. The resulting fragments can have masses between $10^{20}$ g to $10^{32}$ g, with radii ranging from $10^{-2}$ m to $10^5$ m, while the black holes can have masses between $10^{8}$ g to $10^{34}$ g. Furthermore, a unique feature of this model is the late-time formation of black holes which can evaporate away today. We compare where these objects lie with respect to current primordial black hole and MACHO constraints.</description>

      <title>Folded context condensation in Path Integral formalism for infinite context transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note is written for rapid communication of long context training and to share the idea of how to train it with low memory usage. In the note, we generalize the attention algorithm and neural network of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers and reinterpret it in Path integral formalism. First, the role of the transformer is understood as the time evolution of the token state and second, it is suggested that the all key-token states in the same time as the query-token can attend to the attention with the query token states. As a result of the repetitive time evolution, it is discussed that the token states in the past sequence meats the token states in the present sequence so that the attention between separated sequences becomes possible for maintaining infinite contextual information just by using low memory for limited size of sequence. For the experiment, the $12$ input token window size was taken and one GPU with $24$GB memory was used for the pre-training. It was confirmed that more than $150$ length context is preserved. The sampling result of the training, the code and the other details will be included in the revised version of this note later.</description>

      <title>Mysterious anomalies in Earth's atmosphere and strongly interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently argued [1-3] that there is a number of mysterious observations which are very hard to explain by conventional physics. The mysterious anomalies include (but not limited) to such unexpected correlations as temperature variation in stratosphere, the total electron content (TEC) of the Earths atmosphere, the earthquake activity from one hand, and positions of the planets from another hand. It has been hypothesized in [1-3] that the corresponding mysterious correlations is a result of the "streaming invisible matter" which suddenly become very strongly interacting material when enter the Earth's atmosphere. We propose that some of these (and many other) mysteries might be result of rare (but energetic) events when the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQN) hit the Earth. In different words, we identify "streaming invisible matter" conjectured by [1-3] with the AQNs. Therefore, we offer a specific microscopical mechanism which could shed some light on the mysterious correlations reported in [1-3]. One should emphasize that the AQN model was originally invented long ago to explain the observed similarity between the dark and the visible components in the Universe, i.e. $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$; it was not invented to fit the observed anomalies which represent the topic of this work. We support this proposal by demonstrating that intensity and the spectral features of the AQN induced events are consistent with the corresponding characteristics of the puzzling observations as reported in [1-3].</description>

      <title>Axi-Higgs portal Dark Matter via Wess-Zumino mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the axion portal between the visible and the dark sector, where the Dark Matter is charged under a simple abelian extension of the Standard Model. In general, such models are anomalous and are rendered gauge invariant by a St\"ukelberg axion through Wess-Zumino/Green-Schwarz mechanism. This axion mixes with other Goldstone bosons in the model to give a physical axi-Higgs which becomes massive upon breaking the anomalous gauge group. Such axi-Higgs fields charged under the anomalous symmetry act as mediators for the Dark Matter annihilation to Standard Model particles and can lead to an efficient freeze-out mechanism. Here, we show that the St{\"u}kelberg axion and the resultant axi-Higgs, with its appropriate shift symmetry cancels the quantum anomalies and also generate the observed relic density for the Dark Matter. Moreover, we show that the relevant parameter space in our model, where photon production dominates, is safe from FermiLAT, Cherenkov Telescope Array, and H.E.S.S. indirect detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Onset of scaling violation in pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties, parameter-free predictions are delivered for pion and kaon elastic electromagnetic form factors, $F_{P=\pi,K}$, thereby unifying them with kindred results for nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors. Regarding positive-charge states, the analysis stresses that the presence of scaling violations in QCD entails that $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ should exhibit a single maximum on $Q^2&gt;0$. Locating such a maximum is both necessary and sufficient to establish the existence of scaling violations. The study predicts that, for charged $\pi$, $K$ mesons, the $Q^2 F_P(Q^2)$ maximum lies in the neighbourhood $Q^2 \simeq 5\,$GeV$^2$. Foreseeable experiments will test these predictions and, providing their $Q^2$ reach meets expectations, potentially also provide details on the momentum dependence of meson form factor scaling violation.</description>

      <title>Amplitude analysis of $ B^0 \to K^0_S K^+ K^-$ decays in a quasi-two-body QCD factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $B^0 \to K^0_S K^+ K^- $ decay amplitude is derived within a quasi-two-body QCD factorization framework in terms of kaon form factors and $B^0$ to two-kaon-transition functions. The final state kaon-kaon interactions in the $S$, $P$, and $D$ waves are taken into account. The unitarity constraints are satisfied for the two kaons in scalar states. It is shown that with few terms of the full decay amplitude one may reach a fair agreement with the total branching fraction and Dalitz-plot projections published in 2010 by the Belle Collaboration and in 2012 by the \textit{BABAR} Collaboration. With~13 free parameters, our model fits the corresponding~422 data with a $\chi^2$ of~583.6 which leads to a $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom equal to 1.43. The dominant branching fraction arises from the $f_0(K^+K^-) K^0_S$ mode with~83.0~\% of the total branching. The next important mode is dominated by $\phi K^0_S$ plus small $\omega K^0_S$ and $\rho^0 K^0_S$ modes with~18.3~\% of the total. Then follows the $a_0^\pm K^\mp$ mode with~6.2~\%. Adding the other smaller modes, the total percentage sum is~107.7~\% which indicates a small interference contribution. In most regions of the Dalitz plot, our model gives rather small $CP$ asymmetry, but in some parts its values can be large and positive or negative. Its predicted total value is equal to $-0.11$~\%. The calculated time dependent {\it CP}-asymmetry parameters agree, within errors, with those obtained by the \textit{BABAR} analysis. Our model amplitude can be the basis for a parametrization in experimental Dalitz plot analyses of LHCb and Belle II Collaborations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting general dark matter-bound-electron interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we revisit general dark matter (DM)-bound-electron interactions studied previously in the influential work of [Catena et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 033195 (2020)]. We derive the DM-electron response functions and find a crucial minus sign was missed for the second atomic response function $W_2$ defined in that work. The minus sign has significant phenomenological consequences when explaining experimental bounds on specific DM scenarios. Furthermore, for the most general DM-electron nonrelativistic or relativistic interactions for DM with spin up to one, we find there are three DM response functions ($a_{0,1,2}$) whose corresponding atomic response functions ($\widetilde W_{0,1,2}$) are linear combinations of the four response functions ($W_{1,2,3,4}$) given in that work, $$ \widetilde W_0 = W_1, \, \widetilde W_2 = |\mathbf{v}_0^\perp|^2 W_1+ W_3 - 2 {m_e\, \mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{v}_0^\perp \over \mathbf{q}^2} W_2,\, \widetilde W_3 = { (\mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{v}_0^\perp)^2 \over \mathbf{q}^2} W_1 + {m_e^2 \over \mathbf{q}^2}W_4 - 2 {m_e\, \mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{v}_0^\perp \over \mathbf{q}^2} W_2. $$ Due to the minus sign correction for $W_2$, there can be significant cancellations between the $W_2$ and $W_{3,4}$ terms, so that $\widetilde W_{2,3}$ are dominated by the usual response function $W_1$ in some cases. Ignoring the sign could thus result in misinterpretation of the experimental data in some DM scenarios. As an example, we show that the recent XENON1T constraint on the fermionic DM anapole moment is weakened by a factor of 2 or so. Many DM scenarios involving DM or electron axial-vector current can yield $W_2$ and thus are potentially affected by the sign.</description>

Abstract: We address the Light-Shining-through thin Wall (LSthinW) laboratory setup to estimate the axion-like particle (ALP) sensitivity of a two radio frequency (RF) cavities immersed in static magnetic field. We show that the sufficiently thin wall between cavities can lead the improved sensitivity of the purely laboratory probes of ALP in the mass range $10^{-6}~\mbox{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-5}~\mbox{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the core radius and density jumps inside Earth using atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos can act as a tool to probe the interior of Earth using weak interactions, and can provide information complementary to that obtained from gravitational and seismic measurements. While passing through Earth, multi-GeV neutrinos encounter Earth matter effects due to the coherent forward scattering with the ambient electrons, which alter the neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend upon the density distribution of electrons inside Earth, and hence, can be used to determine the internal structure of Earth. In this work, we employ a five-layered model of Earth where the layer densities and radii are modified, keeping the mass and moment of inertia of Earth unchanged and respecting the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. We use the proposed INO-ICAL detector as an example of an atmospheric neutrino experiment that can distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos efficiently in the multi-GeV energy range. Our analysis demonstrates the role such an experiment can play in simultaneously constraining the density jumps inside Earth and the location of the core-mantle boundary.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations as a Gravitational Wave Detector?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) can alter the neutrino propagation distance and thus affect neutrino oscillations. This can result in a complete disappearance of the oscillatory behavior that competes with other sources of neutrino decoherence. We develop a set of criteria that determines under which conditions neutrino oscillations are sensitive to this effect, and discuss three concrete scenarios for neutrinos from astrophysical sources. We find that neutrino oscillations may probe so far unexplored regions of the GW parameter space.</description>

      <title>Fully Charmed Tetraquark States in $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ Color Structure via QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated by the recent experimental results on the fully-charm tetraquark states, we systematically calculate the mass spectra of the fully-charm tetraquark states in $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ color configuration via QCD sum rules. By constructing nine $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ type currents with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{-+},0^{--},1^{-+},1^{+-},1^{--}$ and $2^{++}$, we perform analytic calculation up to dimension six in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). We find the fully-charm tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{+-},2^{++}$ lie around 6.48 $\sim$ 6.62 GeV while the fully-charm tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=0^{-+},0^{--},1^{--},1^{-+}$ are about 6.85$ \sim $7.02 GeV. Notably, the mass predictions for the $c\bar{c}c\bar{c}$ tetraquarks, specifically those with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$, align with the broad structure identified by LHCb. Moreover, the masses of fully-charm tetraquarks with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ are anticipated to match closely with the mass of X(6900), considering the margin of error. Such findings hint at the presence of some $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ components within the di-$J/\psi$ structures observed by LHCb. The predictions for tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{+-},1^{--}$ may be accessible in the future BelleII, Super-B, PANDA, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Multiplets as Dark Matter candidates: A brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I provide a thorough review of the theoretical and experimental status of ElectroWeak multiplets as Dark Matter candidates, serving as the prototype of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) Dark Matter. Specifically, the examination includes both real SU(2) representations with zero hypercharge and complex ones with $Y\neq 0$. For the first time, all calculable thermal masses for scalar and fermionic WIMPs are computed, incorporating significant non-perturbative non-relativistic effects such as Sommerfeld enhancement and the formation of WIMP bound states. WIMP masses of few hundred TeV are shown to be compatible both with $s$-wave unitarity of the annihilation cross-section, and perturbativity. Additionally, a strategy is outlined for probing these scenarios in the next generation of experiments.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal spin polarization in a thermal model with dissipative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of longitudinal spin polarization of the $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We combine a relativistic kinetic-theory framework that includes spin degrees of freedom treated in a classical way with the freeze-out parametrization used in previous investigations. The use of the kinetic theory allows us to incorporate dissipative corrections (due to the thermal shear and gradients of thermal vorticity) into the Pauli-Lubanski vector that determines spin polarization and can be directly compared with the experimental data. As in earlier similar studies, it turns out that a successful description of data can only be achieved with additional assumptions -- in our case, they involve the use of projected thermal vorticity and a suitably adjusted time for spin relaxation ($\tau_s$). From our analysis, we find that $\tau_s \sim 5$ fm/$c$, which is comparable with other estimates.</description>

      <title>The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.</description>

      <title>Momentum non-conservation in a scalar quantum field theory with a planar $\theta$ interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent interest aroused by non-dynamical axionic electrodynamics in the context of topological insulators and Weyl semimetals, we discuss a simple model of the magnetoelectric effect in terms of a $\theta$-scalar field that interacts through a delta-like potential located at a planar interface. Thus, in the bulk regions the field is constructed by standard free waves with the absence of evanescent components. These waves have to be combined into linear superposition to account for the boundary conditions at the interface in order to yield the corresponding normal modes. Our aim is twofold: first we quantize the $\theta$-scalar field using the normal modes in the canonical approach and then we look for applications emphasizing the effect of momentum non-conservation due to the presence of the interface. To this end we calculate the decay of a standard scalar particle into two $\theta$-scalar particles showing the opening of new decay channels. As a second application we deal with the two body scattering of standard charged scalar particles mediated by a $\theta$-scalar particle, focusing on the momentum non-conserving contribution of the scattering amplitude ${\cal M}^{NC}$. We define a generalization of the usual cross section in order to quantify the emergence of these events. We also study the allowed kinematical region for momentum non-conservation as well as the position of the poles of the amplitude ${\cal M}^{NC}$. Finally, the ratio of the magnitudes between ${\cal M}^{NC}$ and the momentum conserving amplitude is discussed in the appropriate region of momentum space.</description>

      <title>Nonradial instabilities in anisotropic neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-radial oscillation modes of a neutron star possess valuable information about its internal structure and nuclear physics. Starting from the quadrupolar order, such modes under general relativity are known as quasi-normal modes since they dissipate energy through gravitational radiation and their frequencies are complex. The stability of these modes is governed by the sign of the imaginary part of the frequency, which determines whether the mode would decay or grow over time. In this Letter, we develop a fully consistent framework in general relativity to study quasi-normal modes of neutron stars with anisotropic pressure, whose motivation includes strong internal magnetic fields and non-vanishing shear or viscosity. We employ parametrized models for the anisotropy and solve the perturbed Einstein field equations numerically. We find that, unlike the case for isotropic neutron stars, the imaginary parts of some of the pressure ($p$-)modes flip signs as the degree of anisotropy deviates from zero, depicting a transition from stable modes to unstable modes. This finding indicates that some anisotropic neutron star models are unstable, potentially restricting the form of sustained anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The salient feature of both classical and quantum gravity is its universal and attractive character. However, less is known about the behaviour and build-up of quantum correlations when quantum systems interact via graviton exchange. In this work, we show that quantum correlations can remain strongly suppressed for certain choices of parameters even when considering two adjacent quantum systems in delocalized states. Using the framework of linearized quantum gravity with post-Newtonian contributions, we find that there are special values of delocalization where gravitationally induced entanglement drops to negligible values, albeit non-vanishing. We find a pronounced cancellation point far from the Planck scale, where the system tends towards classicalization. In addition, we show that quantum correlations begin to reemerge for large and tiny delocalizations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the universal coupling of gravity to the energy-momentum tensor, forming a valley of gravitational entanglement.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter interaction on hybrid star in the light of the recent astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have explored the effect of dark matter interaction on hybrid star (HS) in the light of recent astrophysical observational constraints. The presence of dark matter is assumed to be there in both the hadron as well as the quark sector. The dark matter particle interacts with both hadron and quark matter through the exchange of a scalar as well as a vector meson. The equation of state (EOS) of the hadron part is computed using the NL3 version of the relativistic mean field(RMF) model, whereas the quark part is taken care of using the well-known MIT Bag model with the vector interaction. We investigate the effect of the dark matter density and the mass of the dark matter particle on various observables like mass, radius, tidal deformability of the dark matter admixed hybrid star(DMAHS). In this study, we have noted an intriguing aspect that is the speed of sound in the DMAHS is insensitive to both the mass as well as the density of dark matter. We also observe a striking similarity in the variation of transition mass and its corresponding radius, as well as the maximum mass of neutron stars, with dark matter density and mass. We employ observational constraints from neutron stars to narrow down the allowed range of the parameters of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report reviews the published results of searches for possible additional scalar particles and exotic decays of the Higgs boson performed by the ATLAS Collaboration using up to 140 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. Key results are examined, and observed excesses, while never statistically compelling, are noted. Constraints are placed on parameters of several models which extend the Standard Model, for example by adding one or more singlet or doublet fields, or offering exotic Higgs boson decay channels. Summaries of new searches as well as extensions of previous searches are discussed. These new results have a wider reach or attain stronger exclusion limits. New experimental techniques that were developed for these searches are highlighted. Search channels which have not yet been examined are also listed, as these provide insight into possible future areas of exploration.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Mass function of stellar black holes as revealed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ninety gravitational wave events have been detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and are released in the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Among these events, 83 cases are definitely binary black hole mergers since the masses of all the objects involved significantly exceed the upper limit of neutron stars. The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a pre-merger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a post-merger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis on these two samples. The non-parametric $\tau$ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as $\rho(z) \propto z^{-2.06}$ -- $z^{-2.12}$ based on the two samples. Implications of these findings on the origin of black holes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The resonant conversion, within the inter-galactic medium, of regular photons into dark photons amplifies the anisotropy observed in the CMB, thereby imposing stringent constraints on the existence of light dark photons. In this study, we investigate the impact of light dark photons, with masses in the range $3\times 10^{-15} ~\rm{eV} &lt; m_{A'} &lt; 3\times 10^{-12}~\rm{eV}$ on the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies within the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation utilizing the state-of-the-art large-volume FLAMINGO cosmological simulations. Our results show that using full Planck data, one can expect the existing constraints on the dark photon mixing parameter in this mass range to improve by an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We study the probabilities of a field, subject to random perturbations, to roll down from the top of a potential, where the top is only $C^1$ continuous. We find that the probability to roll down to the left or right depends the square root of the second derivative of the potential at the top. We solve this problem theoretically by using the Fokker-Planck equations in stochastic process and verify our findings numerically. This study may potentially be a new mechanism to explain the origins of asymmetries in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that TeV neutrinos detected from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 can be explained by the beta decays of neutrons produced in photodisintegration of nuclei on ultraviolet photons in the jet. The photodisintergation of nuclei occurs at energies above a few PeV, which explains the 1-100 TeV energies of the observed neutrinos. The gamma-ray flux accompanying the beta decays is expected to be much lower than the neutrino flux, and it agrees well with the gamma-ray observations of NGC 1068. This scenario can be applicable to other jetted Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151. The flavor ratio studies could be a test of this beta decay jet scenario for gamma-ray deficit neutrino sources.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct the complete set of minimal 3-point vertices for the massive Standard Model (SM) based purely on symmetry principles, mass dimension and high-energy behavior and without any recourse to field theory, gauge symmetries or Feynman rules. Because the gravitational vertices are no more challenging than any other vertices in this constructive method, we include them as well. We also calculate the high-energy behavior of these vertices and compare with the well-known massless vertices, both as a check and as a way to pin down the normalization constants. We include all these vertices in tables as a reference for future investigations.</description>

Abstract: We show that next generation Cosmic Microwave Background experiments will be capable of the first ever measurement of the inflaton coupling to other particles, opening a new window to probe the connection between cosmic inflation and particle physics. For our analysis we introduce a simple analytic method to estimate the sensitivity of future CMB observations to the reheating temperature and the inflaton coupling. This sensitivity is based on the impact that the reheating phase after cosmic inflation has on the redshifting of cosmic perturbations. Applying our method to LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 we find that, within a given model of inflation, these missions have the potential to impose both an upper and a lower bound on the inflaton coupling. Further improvement can be achieved if CMB data is combined with optical and 21cm surveys. Our results demonstrate the potential of future observations to constrain microphysical parameters that can provide an important clue to understand how a given model of inflation may be embedded in a more fundamental theory of nature.</description>

      <title>Geometry and unitarity of scalar fields coupled to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories coupled non-conformally to gravity in a manifestly frame-independent fashion. Physical quantities such as the $S$ matrix should be invariant under field redefinitions, and hence can be represented by the geometry of the target space. This elegant geometric formulation, however, is obscured when considering the coupling to gravity because of the redundancy associated with the Weyl transformation. The well-known example is the Higgs inflation, where the target space of the Higgs fields is flat in the Jordan frame but is curved in the Einstein frame. Furthermore, one can even show that any geometry of O$(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models can be flattened by an appropriate Weyl transformation. In this Letter, we extend the notion of the target space by including the conformal mode of the metric, and show that the extended geometry provides a compact formulation that is manifestly Weyl-transformation/field-redefinition invariant. We identify the cutoff scale with the inverse of square root of the extended target space curvature and confirm that it coincides with that obtained from two-to-two scattering amplitudes based on our formalism.</description>

      <title>The $H\rightarrow b\bar{s}$ decay and its implication for the vector-like singlet fermion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vector-like quark model is one of the extensions of the standard model (SM) of particle physics. The simplest version of this model introduces a vector-like singlet quark which can mix with SM quarks and give rise to new contributions to the flavor-changing decays of the Higgs boson. In this work we first present a systematic analysis of the branching ratios of the decays $H\rightarrow b\bar{s}, b\bar{d}$ at leading order in the standard model. Our results show that it is challenging to observe these two modes because of their small branching ratios. Then augmenting the SM with a vector-like singlet top quark, assuming the top partner only mixes with the top quark, complete one-loop contributions are taken into account in the amplitudes. Further results indicate that the branching ratios of the decays $H\rightarrow b\bar{s}, b\bar{d}$ are sensitive to the mass of the top partner $M_{T}$ and the mixing effects characterized by $\sin\theta_{L}$. By tuning the values of $M_{T}$ and $\sin\theta_{L}$, the branching ratios may rise to a level accessible to LHC experiments. Combined with the branching ratios obtained from a probabilistic model, the allowed areas in the $M_{T}-\sin\theta_{L}$ plane are displayed. Tagging efficiencies and feasibility for detecting $H\rightarrow b\bar{s}$ are specifically discussed and we conclude that with large statistics it is promising to discover the $H\rightarrow b\bar{s}$ decay at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We consider a six dimensional gauge theory compactified on $T^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ with magnetic flux. The configurations of models are classified by winding numbers at the fixed points. Requiring the existence of generation numbers and Yukawa coupling, we see that allowed and forbidden configurations are described by geometry of winding numbers.</description>

      <title>Introducing Model Benchmark Analysis for dark matter models with isomorphic lagrangians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach to particle physics phenomenology, which we dubbed as model benchmark analysis. We consider models that provide vertices with similar topology but different Lorentz and gauge structure, which we call isomorphic models. Under this setup, the coupling constants for each theory have the same meaning, in the sense that describe the topologically equivalent diagrams. Consequently, each model acts like a map of parameter space into the observable space. This definition allows to group isomorphic models into families with a common parameter space and perform calculations for each model. As a proof of concept, we obtained some guidelines for the search of leptophilic dark fermions at CLIC, making predictions oriented to discriminate between beyond the standard model scenarios in light of possible signals of new physics that could appear at lepton colliders. We present different observables that can be useful to help discriminating between models.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses from new Weinberg-like operators: Phenomenology of TeV scalar multiplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unique dimension-$5$ effective operator, $LLHH$, known as the Weinberg operator, generates tiny Majorana masses for neutrinos after electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. If there are new scalar multiplets that take vacuum expectation values (VEVs), they should not be far from the electroweak scale. Consequently, they may generate new dimension-$5$ Weinberg-like operators which in turn also contribute to Majorana neutrino masses. In this study, we consider scenarios with one or two new scalars up to quintuplet SU(2) representations. We analyse the scalar potentials, studying whether the new VEVs can be induced and therefore are naturally suppressed, as well as the potential existence of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Additionally, we also obtain general limits on the new scalar multiplets from direct searches at colliders, loop corrections to electroweak precision tests and the $W$-boson mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic dark matter is usually considered to be produced asymmetrically in the early Universe. In this work, we first propose that the symmetric atomic dark matter can be thermally produced through the freeze-out mechanism. The dominant atom anti-atom annihilation channel is the atomic rearrangement. It has a geometrical cross section much larger than that of elementary fermions. After the atomic formation, this annihilation process further depletes dark matter particles and finally freezes out. To give the observed dark matter relic, the dark atoms are naturally ultraheavy, ranging from $10^6$ to $10^{10} \,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the EMPRESS collaboration has included new data in the extraction of the primordial $^4$He abundance from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), resulting in a determination that differs from the previous value and from theoretical expectations. There have been several studies attempting to explain this anomaly which involve variation of fundamental constants between the time of BBN and the present. Since the Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) is the only dimensionful parameter in the Standard Model and it is already known to vary during the electroweak phase transition, we consider the possibility that the vev is slightly different during BBN compared to its present value. A modification of the vev changes not only particle masses but also affects, through mass thresholds, the QCD confinement scale. We use the recently developed PRyMordial program to study this variation and its impact on the $^4$He and deuterium abundances. We find that bounds on $|{\delta v}/{v}|$ are approximately $0.01$, and that the EMPRESS result can be explained within $2\sigma$ if $0.008 &lt; {\delta v}/{v}&lt; 0.02$, but at the cost of worsening the current $2\sigma$ discrepancy in the deuterium abundance to over $3\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Minimal seesaw and leptogenesis with the smallest modular finite group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model for leptons based on the smallest modular finite group $\Gamma_2\cong S_3$ that, for the first time, accounts for both the hints of large low-energy CP-violation in the lepton sector and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe, generated by only two heavy right-handed neutrinos. These same states are also employed in a Minimal seesaw mechanism to generate light neutrino masses. Besides the heavy neutrinos, our particle content is the same as the Standard Model (SM), with the addition of one single modulus $\tau$, whose vacuum expectation value is responsible for both the modular and CP-symmetry breakings. We show that this minimalistic SM extension is enough to get an excellent fit to low energy neutrino observables and to the required baryon asymmetry $\eta_B$. Predictions for the neutrino mass ordering, effective masses in neutrinoless double beta decay and tritium decay as well as for the Majorana phases are also provided.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the underlying structure of axial-vector bottom-charm tetraquarks in the light of their magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic moment yields an excellent framework to explore the inner structure of particles determined by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD, as it is the leading-order response of a bound system to a weak external magnetic field. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of possible axial-vector $T_{bc\bar u \bar u}$, $T_{bc\bar d \bar d}$, and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ tetraquarks are obtained with the help of light-cone QCD sum rules. For this purpose, we assume that these states are represented as a diquark-antidiquark picture with different structures and interpolating currents. The magnetic moment results derived using different diquark-antidiquark configurations differ substantially from each other. This can be translated into more than one tetraquark state with the same quantum number and quark content yet possessing different magnetic moments. From the numerical results obtained, we have concluded that the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ states can project their inner structure, which can be used for their quantum numbers and quark-gluon organization. The contribution of individual quarks to the magnetic moments is also analyzed for completeness. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ tetraquarks, together with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these interesting tetraquarks, may be valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in unraveling the internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that unlike the SM in the flavor spin theories (theories with non- Euclidean/pseudo-unitary signature of the kinematic quadratic term of the Lagrangian) the Yukawa mass matrices are not arbitrary. This restricts the possible textures of both lepton and quark flavor mixing matrices to the experimentally observed form and reduces the number of real mixing parameters by two. In addition, some pairs of elements of V_CKM and separately U_PMNS are forced to have the same absolute values, which is experimentally confirmed within the error bounds. Apart from the flavor mixing the change in the signature imprints no changes in the SM.</description>

      <title>Large CP violation in charmed baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our study of CP violation in two-body weak decays of antitriplet charmed baryons. In the standard model, the $\Delta c =1$ quark level interactions inducing CP violation for the relevant decays can be grouped into two types, one proportional to the CKM matrix elements $\lambda_d= V_{ud}V^*_{cd}$ and another $\lambda_b = V_{us}V^*_{cs}$. Recent studies have shown that with $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry, the decay amplitudes, including their strong phases, can be determined by data if contributions from $\lambda_b$ are neglected. However, the $\lambda_b$ terms must be retained to create interferences that induce CP violation. Some of them can be recovered in the framework of $SU(3)_F$ flavor symmetry, and the CP-violating rate asymmetry $A_{CP}$ is predicted to be of the order of ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$. We find that final state re-scattering effects, which link hadronic matrix elements proportional to $\lambda_d$ and $\lambda_b$, can help recover the missing terms. The re-scattering effects can enhance CP violation by an order of magnitude, with $A_{CP} (\Xi_c^0 \to p K^-) - A_{CP} (\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^+ \pi^-)$ being as large as $1.87 \times 10^{-3}$. This makes it promising to observe CP violation for the first time in baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Momentum Spectra of pair created in a pulsed field at finite times: Are Oscillations "Real"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum in a time-varying, spatially uniform pulsed electric field given by $E(t) = E_0 sech^2(t/\tau)$, with height of $E_0$ and width of $\tau$. Sah recently discussed the problem of pair production after a finite evolution time [9]. This raises questions about the instantaneous appearance of particles in pair production and their behavior at intermediate times when using a formalism that involves solving an evolution equation for a dynamical quantity. Is it possible to make general statements about this behavior? To address these questions, we analytically compute the probability of $(e^+ e^-)$ pair production in momentum space using the exact solution of the one-particle time-dependent Dirac equation, and we compare the result with quantum kinetic theory (QKT). Both approaches allow us to study the particle momentum spectrum at any instant in time and can potentially unveil valuable information regarding quantum non-equilibrium physics. We analyze both approaches' Longitudinal Momentum Spectrum (LMS) of the created particles at finite times. We observe oscillatory structure in the LMS. This oscillation behavior at finite time clearly illustrates the quantum interference effects associated with particle production. It is worth noting that both approaches exhibit quantum interference patterns at finite times, manifested as oscillations observed in the LMS. This reveals that these oscillations are not due to transient excitations and basis-dependent signatures. Again, we emphasize that the oscillations seen in the LMS from both approaches are not artifacts but possess significant physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Properties of the Proton Structure at Low x within the \textbf{xFitter} framework</title>

Abstract: The structure of the proton exhibits Fractal behavior at low \textit{x}, where \textit{x} is the fraction of the proton's momentum carried by the interacting partons. This Fractal behavior is characterized by self-similar properties at different scales and can be quantified using the concept of Fractal dimension. An investigation into the Fractal properties of the proton structure at low \textit{x} is critical for understanding the fundamental properties of the strong force and developing a more comprehensive understanding of the hadron structure. Fractals, characterized by self-similar patterns across scales, demonstrate a direct correlation between their Fractal dimension and entropy, where higher Fractal dimensions correspond to increased informational content. Furthermore, it is essential for designing high-energy physics experiments and developing more accurate models of subatomic particle interactions. This paper has a fresh look at the self-similar properties of the proton structure at low \textit{x}. Our study involves the use of the \textbf{xFitter} framework to parameterize the proton structure functions with a Fractal formalism at low \textit{x}. We also examine how the inclusion of new data affects the results of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Fast radio burst energy function in the presence of $\rm DM_{host}$ variation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been found in great numbers, but the physical mechanism of these sources is still a mystery. The redshift evolutions of the FRB energy distribution function and the volumetric rate shed light on the origin of FRBs. However, such estimations rely on the dispersion measurement (DM)-redshift ($z$) relationship. A few FRBs that have been detected recently show large excess DMs beyond the expectation from the cosmological and Milky Way contributions, which indicates large spread of DMs from their host galaxies. In this work, we adopt two lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models and estimate the energy function using the non-repeating FRBs selected from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 1. By comparing the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ models to a constant ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model, the FRB energy function results are consistent within the measurement uncertainty. We also estimate the volumetric rate of the non-repeating FRBs in three different redshift bins. The volumetric rate shows that the trend is consistent with the stellar-mass density redshift evolution. Since the lognormal-distributed ${\rm DM}_{\rm host}$ model increases the measurement errors, the inference of FRBs tracking the stellar-mass density is nonetheless undermined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to RG flows and show that one-loop flows in multiscalar theories can be described by commutative but non-associative algebras. As an example related to $D$-brane field theories and tensor models, we study the algebra of a theory with $M$ $SU(N)$ adjoint scalars and its large $N$ limits. The algebraic concepts of idempotents and Peirce numbers/Kowalevski exponents are used to characterise the RG flows. We classify and describe all large $N$ limits of algebras of multiadjoint scalar models: the standard `t Hooft matrix theory limit, a `multi-matrix' limit, each with one free parameter, and an intermediate case with extra symmetry and no free parameter of the algebra, but an emergent free parameter from a line of one-loop fixed points. The algebra identifies these limits without diagrammatic or combinatorial analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.</description>

Such black holes are a viable alternative to the Kerr black hole, having a much more complicated geodesic structure and resulting shadows. We investigate how a nontrivial Gauss curvature alters the pictures for different amounts of scalar hair around the black holes, quantified by a normalized charge. Our results show that for high values of this charge, close to a boson star limit, chaotic shadows are observed with multiple small disconnected components for all considered Gaussian curvatures. For moderately large amounts of scalar hair and corresponding normalized charge, although the shadows still exhibit chaotic behavior, a dominant shadow component emerges, the size and shape of which are substantially influenced by the Gaussian curvature. For instance, highly chaotic shadows for flat target space, start developing a large central shadow region with the increase of the Gauss curvature even for black holes with substantially heavy scalar hair. For lower values of the normalized charge, the shadows resemble qualitatively the Kerr black hole while the Gaussian curvature has a small impact on their properties.</description>

Abstract: We propose a simple fit function, $L_{\nu_i}(t) = C\, t^{-\alpha}\, e^{-(t/\tau)^{n}}$, to parametrize the luminosities of neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors during the protoneutron star (PNS) cooling phase at post-bounce times $t \gtrsim 1$ s. This fit is based on results from a set of neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical symmetry. The simulations were performed with an energy-dependent transport for six neutrino species and took into account the effects of convection and muons in the dense and hot PNS interior. We provide values of the fit parameters $C$, $\alpha$, $\tau$, and $n$ for different neutron star masses and equations of state as well as correlations between these fit parameters. Our functional description is useful for analytic supernova modeling, for characterizing the neutrino light curves in large underground neutrino detectors, and as a tool to extract information from measured signals on the mass and equation of state of the PNS and on secondary signal components on top of the PNS's neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>

Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>
