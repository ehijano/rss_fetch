      <title>Seebeck Effect of Dirac Electrons in Organic Conductors under Hydrostatic Pressure Using a Tight-Binding Model Derived from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Seebeck coefficient is examined for two-dimensional Dirac electrons in the three-quarter filled organic conductor alpha-(BEDT-TTF)_2I_3 under hydrostatic pressure, where the Seebeck coefficient is proportional to the ratio of the thermoelectric conductivity to the electrical conductivity. We present an improved tight-binding model in two dimensions with transfer energies determined from first-principles density functional theory calculations with an experimentally determined crystal structure. The temperatutre dependence of the Seebeck coefficient is calculated by adding impurity and electron-phonon scatterings. Noting a zero-gap state due to the Dirac cone, which results in a competition from contributions between the conduction and valence bands, we show positive S_x and S_y at finite temperatures and analyze them in terms of spectral conductivity. The relevance of the calculated S_x (perpendicular to the molecular stacking axis) to the experiment is discussed.</description>

      <title>Dressed Majorana fermion in a hybrid nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy theory of hybrid nanowire systems fails to define Majorana fermion (MF) in the strong tunneling and magnetic field strength. To address this limitation, we propose a holistic approach to define MF in which the quasi-excitation in nanowire and superconductor constitutes together its own ``antiparticles''. This definition is general, beyond the constraint presented in the low-energy theory. It reveals that the Majorana phase depends not only on the chemical potential and Zeeman energy in nanowire but also on those of superconductor, and that the mismatch of chemical potential leads not to observe MF. Such a broader perspective provides more specific experimental guidance under various conditions</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport and current noise through a multilevel Anderson impurity: Three-body Fermi-liquid corrections in quantum dots and magnetic alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Fermi-liquid description for thermoelectric transport and current noise, applicable to multilevel quantum dots (QD) and magnetic alloys (MA) without electron-hole or time-reversal symmetry. Our formulation for the low-energy transport is based on an Anderson model with $N$ discrete impurity levels, and is asymptotically exact at low energies, up to the next-leading order terms in power expansions with respect to temperature $T$ and bias voltage $eV$. The expansion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Fermi-liquid parameters, which include the three-body correlation functions defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state in addition to the linear susceptibilities and the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of impurity electrons. We apply this formulation to SU($N$) symmetric QD and MA, and calculate the correlation functions for $N=4$ and $6$, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The three-body correlations are shown to be determined by a single parameter over a wide range of electron fillings $1 \lesssim N_d^{} \lesssim N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions $U$, and they also exhibit the plateau structures due to the SU($N$) Kondo effects at integer values of $N_d^{}$. We find that the Lorenz number $L=\kappa/(T \sigma)$ for QD and MA, defined as the ratio of the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ to the electrical conductivity $\sigma$, deviates from the universal Wiedemann-Franz value $\pi^2/(3e^2)$ as the temperature increases from $T=0$, showing the $T^2$ dependence, the coefficient for which depends on the three-body correlations away from half filling. We also demonstrate the role of three-body correlations on the nonlinear current noise and the other transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Properties of a Majorana fermion ensemble with exciton-like mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the relativistic scenario, we dedicate our study to the relativistic quantum description of one-dimensional Majorana fermions. Thus, we focus on aspects related to exciton-like particles. Seeking to reach our purpose, one analyzes the relativistic quantum mechanical system characterized by an effective mass distribution. In this context, we adopt an exciton-like position-dependent mass without impurity, i.e., without electromagnetic interactions. From this perspective, one notes results of noteworthy interest as consequences of the theory adopted. For instance, we highlight that, even without interaction, exciton-like Majorana fermions manifest theoretically bound states. Also, we construct a Majorana fermion ensemble with effective mass immersed in a thermal reservoir. That allows for a thorough investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the system. Among the thermodynamic characteristics studied in the canonical ensemble, we focus on the Helmholtz free energy, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity. The numerical results obtained for these thermodynamic properties corroborate the validity of the Dulong-Petit law for our system.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the energy landscape of a Bloch point singularity with curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects, or singularities, play a key role in the statics and dynamics of complex systems. In magnetism, Bloch point singularities represent point defects that mediate the nucleation of textures such as skyrmions and hopfions. However, while the textures are typically stabilised in chiral magnets, the influence of chirality on the Bloch point singularities remains relatively unexplored. Here we harness advanced three-dimensional nanofabrication to explore the influence of chirality on Bloch point singularities by introducing curvature-induced symmetry breaking in a ferromagnetic nanowire. Combining X-ray magnetic microscopy with the application of in situ magnetic fields, we demonstrate that Bloch point singularity-containing domain walls are stabilised in straight regions of the sample, and determine that curvature can be used to tune the energy landscape of the Bloch points. Not only are we able to pattern pinning points but, by controlling the gradient of curvature, we define asymmetric potential wells to realise a robust Bloch point shift-register with non-reciprocal behaviour. These insights into the influence of symmetry and chirality on singularities offers a route to the controlled nucleation and propagation of topological textures, providing opportunities for logic and computing devices.</description>

      <title>Telecom wavelength single-photon source based on InGaSb/AlGaSb quantum dot technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic light sources capable of generating quantum states on-demand at wavelengths compatible with fiber optics and atmospheric transmission are essential for practical applications in quantum communication, photonic quantum computing, and quantum metrology. To this end, single-photon emission at 1500 nm is demonstrated from an InGaSb quantum dot (QD) grown by filling droplet-etched nanoholes for the first time. The QD was embedded in a device structure comprising an antimony-based high refractive index contrast back-reflector designed for cryogenic operation and a solid immersion lens for improved photon extraction. The longitudinal optical (LO) phonon assisted excitation of the QD ground state and quasi-resonant excitation of the QD excited state is realized with a novel compact wavelength-tunable power-stabilized semiconductor laser. These direct approaches to exciting a single QD unlock access to its excitonic fine structure. The neutral exciton-biexciton structure exhibits a negative binding energy of 1.4 meV (2.6 nm) and a fine structure splitting of 24.1+/-0.4 ueV. Furthermore, spectrally pure/isolated emission from a charged single exciton state with a single-photon purity of 95 % is achieved with LO phonon assisted two-color excitation. These results represent a major step forward for the use of the novel antimonide-based QD emitters as deterministic quantum light sources in complex quantum secure networks exploiting the wavelength compatibility with standard telecom fibers.</description>

      <title>Hydrostatic pressure control of the spin-orbit proximity effect and spin relaxation in a phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective control of interlayer interactions is a key element in modifying the properties of van der Waals heterostructures and the next step toward their practical applications. Focusing on the phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure, we demonstrate, using first-principles calculations, how the spin-orbit coupling can be transferred from WSe$_2$, a strong spin-orbit coupling material, to phosphorene and further amplified by applying vertical pressure. We simulate external pressure by changing the interlayer distance between bilayer constituents and show that it is possible to tune the spin-orbit field of phosphorene holes in a controllable way. By fitting effective electronic states of the proposed Hamiltonian to the first principles data, we reveal that the spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene hole bands is enhanced more than two times for experimentally accessible pressures up to 17 kbar. Finally, we find that the pressure-enhanced spin-orbit coupling boosts the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism, reducing the spin lifetime of phosphorene holes by factor 4.</description>

      <title>Higher order topological defects in a moir\'e lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are ubiquitous, they manifest in a wide variety of systems such as liquid crystals, magnets or superconductors. The recent quest for nonabelian anyons in condensed matter physics stimulates the interest for topological defects since they can be hosted in vortices in quantum magnets or topological superconductors. In addition to these vortex defects, in this study we propose to investigate edge dislocations in 2D magnets as new building blocks for topological physics since they can be described as vortices in the structural phase field. Here we demonstrate the existence of higher order topological dislocations within the higher order moir\'e pattern of the van der Waals 2D magnet CrCl3 deposited on Au(111). Surprizingly, these higher order dislocations arise from ordinary simple edge dislocations in the atomic lattice of CrCl3. We provide a theoretical framework explaining the higher order dislocations as vortex with a winding Chern number of 2. We expect that these original defects could stabilize some anyons either in a 2D quantum magnet or within a 2D superconductor coupled to it.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity CZ Gates in Double Quantum Dot -- Circuit QED Systems Beyond the Rotating-Wave Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit CZ gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the detrimental impact of time-dependent terms ignored by RWA is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces fewer time-dependent terms and show that it outperforms its spin counterpart. We find that drive amplitude - a parameter dropped in RWA - is critical for optimizing fidelity and map out high-fidelity regimes. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.</description>

      <title>Magnon transmission across $\nu=1|-1|1$ mono-layer graphene junction as a probe of electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnon transmission across gate-controlled junctions in the $n=0$ manifold of Landau levels in monolayer graphene, allowing for both spin and valley Zeeman fields. We show that by tuning the external perpendicular magnetic field, the phase in the intermediate region of a $1|\nu_m|1$ sandwich geometry can be changed, due to which the magnon transmission can be switched between fully transmitting and fully blocked. Our analysis, along with the experimental measurements, can be used to determine the anisotropic couplings in the sample.</description>

      <title>Coherent Heat Transfer Leads to Genuine Quantum Enhancement in Performances of Continuous Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional continuous quantum heat engines rely on incoherent heat transfer with the baths and, thus, have limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding significant quantum enhancement in performance. These continuous engines, termed as coherent engines, consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. The closest quantum incoherent analogs are those that only allow incoherent heat transfer between the qutrit and the baths via one-photon transitions relying on two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver much higher power output and a much lower signal-to-noise ratio in power, where the latter signifies the reliability of an engine, compared to incoherent engines. Coherent engines manifest more non-classical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the fundamental lower limit on reliability given by the quantum version of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, making them highly reliable. These genuine enhancements in performance by hundreds of folds over incoherent engines and the saturation of the quantum limit by coherent engines are directly attributed to its capacity to harness higher energetic coherence which is, again, a consequence of coherent heat transfer. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find important implications in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quasispins of vacancy defects and their interactions in disordered antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacancy defects in disordered magnetic materials are known to act as effective spins, ``quasispins'', in response to an external magnetic field. In the dilute limit, the contributions of such ``quasispins'' to the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_\text{vac}(T)\propto N_\text{vac}/T$ are singular in the limit of low temperatures $T$ and match those of free spins. With increasing the density of vacancies, their interactions may become essential. Motivated by frustrated and quasi-one-dimensional magnetic materials, we study analytically quasispins and their interactions in a generic system that has short-range antiferromagnetic order and lacks long-range order. We predict that if the vacancy defect does not disrupt the short-range antiferromagnetic order around it, the quasispin value matches the value of spins of the magnetic atoms in the material, and the correlators of the quasispins of different vacancies match the spin-spin correlators in the vacancy-free material. We confirm our conclusions by exact calculations for Ising chains with nearest-neighbour and next-to-nearest-neighbour interactions. We also compute the first virial correction to the susceptibility of a magnetic material due to the interactions of vacancy quasispins.</description>

      <title>Current dependence of the low bias resistance of small capacitance Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dc current-voltage characteristics of small Josephson junctions reveal features that are not observed in larger junctions, in particular, a switch to the finite voltage state at current values much less than the expected critical current of the junction and a finite resistance in the nominally superconducting regime. Both phenomena are due to the increased sensitivity to noise associated with the small capacitance of the Josephson junction and have been extensively studied a few decades ago. Here I focus on the current bias dependence of the differential resistance of the junction at low current bias in the nominally superconducting regime, using a quantum Langevin equation approach that enables a physically transparent incorporation of the noise environment of the junction. A similar approach might be useful in modeling the sensitivity of superconducting qubits to noise in the microwave regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), as a new member of Hall effect family, has been realized in many materials, attracting a great deal of attention. Here, we report the observation of NLHE in magnetic topological insulator Sb-doped MnBi4Te7 flakes. The NLHE generation efficiency can reach up to 0.06 V^-1, which is comparable to that observed in MnBi2Te4. Differently, the NLHE can survive up to 200 K, much larger than the magnetic transition temperature. We further study the scaling behavior of the NLHE with longitudinal conductivity. The linear relationship with opposite slope when temperature is below and above the magnetic transition temperature is uncovered. It reveals that the NLHE originates from skew scattering. Our work provides a platform to search NLHE with larger generation efficiency at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing topological invariants of two-dimensional quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer circuits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Chiral Anomaly at Finite Temperature and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational anomaly vertex $\langle TTJ_5\rangle$ (graviton - graviton - axial current) under conditions of finite density and temperature. Through a direct analysis of perturbative contributions, we demonstrate that neither finite temperature nor finite fermion density affects the gravitational chiral anomaly. These results find application in several contexts, from topological materials to the early universe plasma. They affect the decay of any axion or axion-like particle into gravitational waves, in very dense and hot environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the mesoscopic-leads formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to sample the distributions of charge, heat, and entropy production in open quantum systems coupled strongly to macroscopic reservoirs, with both temporal and energy resolution and beyond the linear-response regime. Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation, where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak system-environment coupling.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of random alloy GaBi$_{x}$As$_{1-x}$ barriers in InAs quantum dot molecules: alloy strain and orbital effects towards enhanced tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10115v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM). The two dots can be resonantly tuned to form "molecule-like" coupled hole states from the hybridization of hole states otherwise localized in each respective dot. Furthermore, spin-mixing of the hybridized states in dots offset along their stacking direction enables qubit rotation to be driven optically, allowing for an all-optical qubit control scheme. Increasing the magnitude of this spin mixing is important for optical quantum control protocols. To enhance the tunnel coupling and spin-mixing across the dots, we introduce Bi in the GaAs inter-dot barrier. Previously, we showed how to model InAs/GaBiAs in an atomistic tight-binding formalism, and how the dot energy levels are affected by the alloy. In this paper, we discuss the lowering of the tunnel barrier, which results in a three fold increase of hole tunnel coupling strength in the presence of a 7% alloy. Additionally, we show how an asymmetric strain between the two dots caused by the alloy shifts the resonance. Finally, we discuss device geometries for which the introduction of Bi is most advantageous.</description>

      <title>Bound states and local topological phase diagram of classical impurity spins coupled to a Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of bound states induced by local impurities coupled to an insulating host depends decisively on the global topological properties of the host's electronic structure. In this context, we consider magnetic impurities modelled as classical unit-length spins that are exchange-coupled to the spinful Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the spectral flow of bound states with the coupling strength $J$ in both the topologically trivial and Chern-insulating phases. In addition to conventional $k$-space topology, an additional, spatially local topological feature is available, based on the space of impurity-spin configurations forming, in case of $R$ impurities, an $R$-fold direct product of two-dimensional spheres. Global $k$-space and local $S$-space topology are represented by different topological invariants, the first ($k$-space) Chern number and the $R$-th ($S$-space) spin-Chern number. We demonstrate that there is a local $S$-space topological transition as a function of $J$ associated with a change in the spin Chern number and work out the implications of this for the $J$-dependent local electronic structure close to the impurities and, in particular, for in-gap bound states. The critical exchange couplings' dependence on the parameters of the Haldane model, and thus on the $k$-space topological state, is obtained numerically to construct local topological phase diagrams for systems with $R=1$ and $R=2$ impurity spins.</description>

      <title>Spintronic virtual neural network by a voltage controlled ferromagnet for associative memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, an associative memory operation by a virtual oscillator network, consisting of a single spintronic oscillator, was examined to solve issues in conventional, real oscillators-based neural networks such as inhomogeneities between the oscillators. However, the spintronic oscillator still carries issues dissipating large amount of energy because it is driven by electric current. Here, we propose to use a single ferromagnet manipulated by voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect as a fundamental element in a virtual neural network, which will contribute to significantly reducing the Joule heating caused by electric current. Instead of the oscillation in oscillator networks, magnetization relaxation dynamics were used for the associative memory operation. The associative memory operation for alphabet patterns is successfully demonstrated by giving correspondences between the colors in a pattern recognition task and the sign of a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy coefficient, which could be either positive or negative via the VCMA effect.</description>

      <title>Dichotomous Dynamics of Magnetic Monopole Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent advance in the study of emergent magnetic monopoles was the discovery that monopole motion is restricted to dynamical fractal trajectories (J. Hall\'en et al, Science 378, 1218 (2022)) thus explaining the characteristics of magnetic monopole noise spectra (Dusad, R. et al. Nature 571, 234 (2019); Samarakoon, A. M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2117453119 (2022)). Here we apply this new theory to explore the dynamics of field-driven monopole currents, finding them comprised of two quite distinct transport processes: initially swift fractal rearrangements of local monopole configurations followed by conventional monopole diffusion. This theory also predicts a characteristic frequency dependence of the dissipative loss-angle for AC-field-driven currents. To explore these novel perspectives on monopole transport, we introduce simultaneous monopole current control and measurement techniques using SQUID-based monopole current sensors. For the canonical material Dy2Ti2O7, we measure ${\Phi}(t)$, the time-dependence of magnetic flux threading the sample when a net monopole current $J(t) = \dot{\Phi}(t)/\mu_0$ is generated by applying an external magnetic field $B_0(t)$. These experiments find a sharp dichotomy of monopole currents, separated by their distinct relaxation time-constants before and after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$ from monopole current initiation. Application of sinusoidal magnetic fields $B_0(t) = Bcos({\omega}t)$ generates oscillating monopole currents whose loss angle ${\theta}(f)$ exhibits a characteristic transition at frequency $f \approx 1.8$ kHz over the same temperature range. Finally, the magnetic noise power is also dichotomic, diminishing sharply after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$. This complex phenomenology represents a new form of heterogeneous dynamics generated by the interplay of fractionalization and local spin configurational symmetry.</description>

      <title>From Local Spin Nematicity to Altermagnets: Footprints of Band Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramers non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting topology of linear, quadratic and cubic free fermion band dispersions that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$ and $3$ harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a spin-triplet nematic superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in quantum materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and propose novel spin-disordered alter-valleymagnets in these systems.</description>

      <title>Quantized perfect transmission in graphene nanoribbons with random hollow adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impurities exist inevitably in two-dimensional materials as they spontaneously adsorb onto the surface during fabrication, usually exerting detrimental effects on electronic transport. Here, we focus on a special type of impurities that preferentially adsorb onto the hollow regions of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), and study how they affect the quantum transport in GNRs. Contrary to previous knowledge that random adatoms should localize electrons, the so-called Anderson localization, noteworthy quantized conductance peaks (QCPs) are observed at specific electron energies. These QCPs are remarkably robust against variations in system size, GNR edge, and adatom properties, and they can reappear at identical energies following an arithmetic sequence of device width. Further investigation of wavefunction reveals a unique transport mode at each QCP energy which transmits through disordered GNRs reflectionlessly, while all the others become fully Anderson localized, indicating the survival of quantum ballistic transport in the localized regime. Our findings highlight the potential utility of hollow adatoms as a powerful tool to manipulate the conductivity of GNRs, and deepen the understanding of the interplay between impurities and graphene.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion lattice in centrosymmetric magnets with local Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common for the local inversion symmetry to break in crystals, even though the whole crystal has global inversion symmetry. This local inversion symmetry breaking allows for a local Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic crystals. Here we show that the local DMI can stabilize a skyrmion as a metastable excitation or as a skyrmion crystal in equilibrium. We consider the crystal structure with layered structure as an example, where local inversion is violated in each layer but a global inversion center exists in the middle of the two layers. These skyrmions come in pairs that are related by inversion symmetry. The two skyrmions with opposite helicity in a pair form a bound state. We study the properties of a skyrmion pair in the ferromagnetic background and determine the equilibrium phase diagram, where a robust lattice of skyrmion pairs is stabilized. Our results point to a new direction to search for the skyrmion lattice in centrosymmetric magnets.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of semi-Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Josephson junction built with the two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal, which features a hybrid of linear and quadratic dispersion around a nodal point. We model the weak link between the two superconducting regions by a Dirac delta potential because it mimics the thin-barrier-limit of a superconductor-barrier-superconductor configuration. Assuming a homogeneous pairing in each region, we set up the BdG formalism for electronlike and holelike quasiparticles propagating along the quadratic-in-momentum dispersion direction. This allows us to compute the discrete bound-state energy spectrum $\varepsilon $ of the subgap Andreev states localized at the junction. In contrast with the Josephson effect investigated for propagation along linearly dispersing directions, we find a pair of doubly degenerate Andreev bound states. Using the dependence of $\varepsilon $ on the superconducting phase difference $\phi$, we compute the variation of Josephson current as a function of $\phi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>
