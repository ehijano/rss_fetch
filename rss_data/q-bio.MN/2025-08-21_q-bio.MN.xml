      <title>Stoichiometric recipes for periodic oscillations in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory chemical reactions are functional components in a variety of biological contexts. In chemistry, the construction and identification of even rudimentary oscillators remain elusive and lack a general framework. Using parameter-rich kinetics - a methodology enabling the disentanglement of parametric dependencies from structural analysis - we investigate the stoichiometry of chemical oscillators. We introduce the concept of oscillatory cores - minimal subnetworks that guarantee the potential for oscillations in any reaction network containing them. These cores fall into two classes, depending on whether they involve positive or negative feedback. In particular, the latter class unveils a family of oscillators - yet to be synthesized - that require a minimum number of reaction steps to exhibit oscillations, a phenomenon we refer to as the principle of length. We identify several mechanisms through which catalysis promotes oscillations: (I) furnishing instability (e.g. autocatalysis), (II) lifting dependencies, (III) lowering length thresholds. Notwithstanding this mechanistic ubiquity, we show that oscillators can also be realized without employing any catalysis. Our results highlight branches of chemistry where oscillators are likely to arise by chance, suggest new strategies for their design, and point to novel classes of oscillators yet to be realized experimentally.</description>

      <title>Negative feedback and oscillations in a model for mRNA translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12926</link>

Abstract: The ribosome flow model (RFM) is a phenomenological model for the unidirectional flow of particles along a 1D chain of $n$ sites. The RFM has been extensively used to study the dynamics of ribosome flow along a single mRNA molecule during translation. In this case, the particles model ribosomes and each site corresponds to a consecutive group of codons. Networks of interconnected RFMs have been used to model and analyze large-scale translation in the cell and, in particular, the effects of competition for shared resources. Here, we analyze the RFM with a negative feedback connection from the protein production rate to the initiation rate. This models, for example, the production of proteins that inhibit the translation of their own mRNA. Using tools from the theory of 2-cooperative dynamical systems, we provide a simple condition guaranteeing that the closed-loop system admits at least one non-trivial periodic solution. When this condition holds, we also explicitly characterize a large set of initial conditions such that any solution emanating from this set converges to a non-trivial periodic solution. Such a solution corresponds to a periodic pattern of ribosome densities along the mRNA, and to a periodic pattern of protein production.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.</description>
