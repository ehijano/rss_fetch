      <title>Recommender Systems in Financial Trading: Using machine-based conviction analysis in an explainable AI investment framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, assets are selected for inclusion in a portfolio (long or short) by human analysts. Teams of human portfolio managers (PMs) seek to weigh and balance these securities using optimisation methods and other portfolio construction processes. Often, human PMs consider human analyst recommendations against the backdrop of the analyst's recommendation track record and the applicability of the analyst to the recommendation they provide. Many firms regularly ask analysts to provide a "conviction" level on their recommendations. In the eyes of PMs, understanding a human analyst's track record has typically come down to basic spread sheet tabulation or, at best, a "virtual portfolio" paper trading book to keep track of results of recommendations.
  Analysts' conviction around their recommendations and their "paper trading" track record are two crucial workflow components between analysts and portfolio construction. Many human PMs may not even appreciate that they factor these data points into their decision-making logic. This chapter explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to replicate these two steps and bridge the gap between AI data analytics and AI-based portfolio construction methods. This field of AI is referred to as Recommender Systems (RS). This chapter will further explore what metadata that RS systems functionally supply to downstream systems and their features.</description>
