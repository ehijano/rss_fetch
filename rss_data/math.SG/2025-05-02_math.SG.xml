      <title>Aganagic's invariant is Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the Coulomb branch of a quiver gauge theory, there is a family of functions parameterized by choices of points in the punctured plane. Aganagic has predicted that Khovanov homology can be recovered from the braid group action on Fukaya-Seidel categories arising from monodromy in said space of potentials. These categories have since been rigorously studied, and shown to contain a certain (combinatorially defined) category on which Webster had previously constructed a (combinatorially defined) braid group action from which the Khovanov homology can be recovered.
  Here we show, by a direct calculation, that the aforementioned containment intertwines said combinatorially defined braid group action with the braid group action arising naturally from monodromy. This provides a mathematical verification that Aganagic's proposal gives a symplectic construction of Khovanov homology -- with both gradings, and over the integers.</description>

      <title>A topological constraint on clean Lagrangian intersections from $\mathbb{Q}$-valued augmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a knot $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, consider its conormal bundle $L_K$ in $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove that if $K$ is the connected sum $K' \# 3_1$ of an arbitrary knot $K'$ and the trefoil knot $3_1$ (or its mirror), then there is no compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\varphi$ on $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\varphi(L_K)$ and the zero section $\mathbb{R}^3$ intersect cleanly along the unknot in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For the proof, we utilize the knot DGA, whose homology was proved to be isomorphic to the knot contact homology by Ekholm, Etnyre, Ng and Sullivan, with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\lambda^{\pm},\mu^{\pm},U^{\pm}]$. We discover a certain algebraic constraint imposed on any augmentation of the knot DGA of $K = K'\# 3_1$ to a field $\mathbf{k}$. This constraint is non-trivial for $\mathbf{k}=\mathbb{Q}$ and plays a key role in the proof, but trivial if $\mathbf{k}$ is quadratically closed or if an augmentation factors through the knot DGA with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\lambda^{\pm},\mu^{\pm}]$ obtained by setting $U=1$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Factorization of Chern-Simons Theory - Gravitational Anyonic Edge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One approach to analyzing entanglement in a gauge theory is embedding it into a factorized theory with edge modes on the entangling boundary. For topological quantum field theories (TQFT), this naturally leads to factorizing a TQFT by adding local edge modes associated with the corresponding CFT. In this work, we instead construct a minimal set of edge modes compatible with the topological invariance of Chern-Simons theory. This leads us to propose a minimal factorization map. These minimal edge modes can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of a particle on a quantum group. Of particular interest is three-dimensional gravity as a Chern-Simons theory with gauge group SL$(2,\mathbb{R}) \times$ SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. Our minimal factorization proposal uniquely gives rise to quantum group edge modes factorizing the bulk state space of 3d gravity. This agrees with earlier proposals that relate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in 3d gravity to topological entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Poisson Bracket Invariants and Wrapped Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poisson bracket invariants, introduced by Buhovsky, Entov, and Polterovich and further studied by Entov and Polterovich, serve as invariants for quadruples of closed sets in symplectic manifolds. Their nonvanishing has significant implications for the existence of Hamiltonian chords between pairs of sets within the quadruple, with bounds on the time-length of these chords. In this work, we establish lower bounds on the Poisson bracket invariants for certain configurations arising in the completion of Liouville domains. These bounds are expressed in terms of the barcode of wrapped Floer homology. Our primary examples come from cotangent bundles of closed Riemannian manifolds, where the quadruple consists of two fibers over distinct points and two cosphere bundles of different radii, or a single cosphere bundle and the zero section.</description>
