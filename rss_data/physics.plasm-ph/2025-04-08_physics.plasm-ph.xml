      <title>Plasma-Treated Polymeric Biomaterials for Improved Surface and Cell Adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface modification of polymeric biomaterials using plasma has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize the cell-material interface without compromising the structural properties of the material. This work presents a critical review of the impact of low-temperature plasma treatment on enhancing cell adhesion, with emphasis on the physicochemical changes induced on the surface of polymers commonly used in biomedical applications. The mechanisms of interaction between reactive plasma species and the polymer surface are analyzed, along with techniques used to introduce hydrophilic functional groups that improve wettability and biocompatibility. Scientific evidence demonstrates that this type of surface modification promotes greater cell spreading, anchorage, and proliferation, making it particularly useful in the design of tissue engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and vascular prostheses. Finally, current and future trends in the development of smart plasma-functionalized biomaterials are discussed, highlighting their role in regenerative medicine.</description>

      <title>Magnetized ICF implosions: ignition at low laser energy using designs with more ablator mass remaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first work to redesign a spherical ICF implosion to best utilize the benefits of applying an external magnetic field. The sub-ignition experiment N170601 is taken as the baseline design, which used 1.57MJ of laser energy. The optimum magnetized design benefits from increasing the shell thickness by 14$\mu$m and decreasing the ice thickness by 18$\mu$m, resulting in a neutron yield of 8.9$\times$10$^{17}$. This is 34$\times$ greater than the unmagnetized simulation of the same design, and 18.5$\times$ the greatest unmagnetized simulation across all designs simulated. The resultant implosion velocity for the magnetized design is lower, which would also reduce ablation front instability growth. This design was found by using a simplified 1D magnetization model, then validated against full 2D extended-MHD capsule simulations with radiation asymmetries applied to correct the shape.</description>

      <title>Scaling of energy delivered through an electrostatic discharge to a small series load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy delivered through a small-resistance series ``victim'' load during electrostatic discharge events in air. For gap lengths over 1~mm, the fraction of the stored energy delivered is mostly gap-length independent, with a slight decrease at larger gaps due to electrode geometry. The energy to the victim scales linearly with circuit capacitance and victim load resistance but does not strongly dependent on circuit inductance. This scaling leads to a simple approach to predicting the maximum energy that will be delivered to a series resistance for the case where the victim load resistance is lower than the spark resistance.</description>

      <title>Phase-Matched Harmonic Generation in Strongly Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic generation in underdense spatially homogeneous plasma is generally expected to be inefficient: in an unmagnetized uniform plasma the fundamental and its harmonics cannot be phase-matched, resulting in third-harmonic generation efficiencies of no more than $10^{-5}$. Here, we describe how a strong uniform magnetic field allows phase-matched harmonic generation in constant-density plasma. We derive phase-matching relations for Type I and Type II second-, third-, and fourth-harmonic generation, and confirm these relations with particle-in-cell simulations. These simulations show that for weakly relativistic femtosecond pulses the efficiencies of second-, third-, and fourth-harmonic generation can reach at least 70%, 14%, and 2% respectively. Additionally, if driven by a two-color beam, third harmonic generation is found to be over 70% efficient and fourth harmonic generation is found to be over 30% efficient.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic particle acceleration in Alfv\'enic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic turbulence is an effective mechanism for particle acceleration in strongly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In this study, we investigate a scenario where turbulent plasma is influenced by a strong guide magnetic field, resulting in highly anisotropic turbulent fluctuations. In such cases, the magnetic moments of particles are conserved, which means that acceleration can only occur along the direction of the magnetic field. Consistent with previous analytic studies, we find through PIC simulations of magnetically dominated pair plasma that the momenta of accelerated particles are closely aligned with the magnetic field lines. Notably, the alignment angle decreases as particle energy increases, potentially limited only by the inherent curvature and gradients of the turbulent magnetic fluctuations. This finding has significant implications for interpreting the synchrotron radiation emitted by highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>First-principles analysis of the warm dense plasma jets in Double-Cone Ignition experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-Cone Ignition (DCI) differs from the traditional laser-driven inertial confinement fusions by relying on gold cones for transverse filtering to achieve warm dense plasma, thereby reducing the energy required during the compression process. Thus, the state of the plasma ejected from the gold cones directly reflects the energy conversion efficiency and influences the subsequent fusion process. In this paper, we analyze the x-ray Thomson scattering data from the earlier stage DCI experiments \cite{zhang2020double}. We combine the imaginary-time correlation function method with first-principles methods to decouple the diagnosis of temperature and density and obtain the temperature and density diagnostic outputs: $25$ $\mathrm{eV}$ and $8\pm2$ $\mathrm{g/cc}$. In the analysis, we consider the effect of multi-element mixing and determine the gold impurity ratio to be $0.162 \pm 0.015 \%$ based on the experimental spectrum. These detailed analysis results demonstrate the role of the gold cone in achieving plasma compression and confirm that the gold impurities are within an acceptable range, providing valuable references for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dispersion in Rotating Electron-Positron-Ion Quantum Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum plasmas in astrophysical environments are abundant due to extreme electric, magnetic, and gravitational fields. These plasmas can be most clearly observed in neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, red dwarfs, accretion disks of black holes, pulsars, quasars, and more. This paper examines the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a three-component e-p-i quantum plasma within a rotating frame, considering the particles' spin, Fermi pressure, and quantum Bohm potential. Additionally, effects unique to this specific environment, such as rotation and gravity, are included. The dispersion of electrons, ions, and positrons has been obtained separately, and their coupling has been analyzed to understand the collective behavior. It has been noted that the quantum effects of Fermi pressure and Bohm potential significantly influence particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>A kinetic CMA diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kinetic Clemmow-Mullaly-Allis (CMA) diagram by systematically analysing the kinetic effects on the wave propagation in a homogeneous thermal plasma. The differences between the cold and kinetic CMA diagrams are outlined. It is found that new boundaries for weakly damped left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves are located above the ion and electron cyclotron frequency lines in the kinetic CMA diagram. Additionally, Langmuir waves in the kinetic CMA diagram occupy a specific region between the new Langmuir wave boundary and the plasma frequency line, while in the cold CMA diagram, they exist on the plasma frequency line. The extraordinary-Bernstein mode transformation frequency lines in the kinetic CMA diagram replace the hybrid resonant frequency lines of the cold CMA diagram, with discontinuities between different cyclotron harmonics. These new boundaries partition the parameter space in the kinetic CMA diagram differently, leading to new inverse wave normal surfaces in the regions bounded by new boundaries. The kinetic CMA diagram not only contributes to a basic understanding of wave properties in thermal plasmas, but also can provide a powerful tool to explore new possible propagation paths.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Alfv\'en and magnetosonic waves in rotating Hall magnetoplasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear theory of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, namely the Alfv{\'e}n and the fast and slow magnetosonic modes in a rotating Hall-MHD plasma with the effects of the obliqueness of the external magnetic field and the Coriolis force and show that these waves can be coupled either by the influence of the Coriolis force or the Hall effects. To this end, we derive a general form of the linear dispersion relation for these coupled modes by the combined influence of the Coriolis force and the Hall effects and analyze numerically their characteristics in three different plasma-$\beta$ regimes: $\beta\sim1$, $\beta&gt;1$, and $\beta&lt;1$, including some particular cases. We show that while the coupling between the Alfv{\'e}n and the fast magnetosonic modes is strong in the low-$\beta$ $(\beta\lesssim1)$ regime and the wave dispersion appears in the form of a thumb curve, in the high-$\beta~(\beta&gt;1)$ regime, the strong coupling can occur between the Alfv{\'e}n and the slow magnetosonic modes and the dispersion appears in the form of a teardrop curve. Switching of the coupling in the regime of $\beta\sim1$ can occur, i.e., instead of a thumb curve, a teardrop curve appears when the obliqueness of propagation and rotational angle are close to $70^\circ$ or more (but less than $90^\circ$). Implications of our results to solar and fusion plasmas are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: Applications to plasma confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the zero order approximation of a charged particle under the influence of a strong magnetic field in a mathematically rigorous manner and clarify in which sense this approximation is valid. We use this to further rigorously derive a displacement formula for the pressure of plasma equilibria and compare our findings to results in the physics literature. The main novelty of our results is a qualitative estimate of the confinement time for optimised plasma equilibria with respect to the gyro frequency. These results are of interest in the context of plasma fusion confinement.</description>

      <title>Kernel and image of the Biot-Savart operator and their applications in stellarator designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Biot-Savart operator acting on $W^{-\frac{1}{2},2}$ regular, div-free, surface currents $j$ \begin{gather}
  \nonumber
  \operatorname{BS}(j)(x)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\Sigma}j(y)\times \frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3}d\sigma(y)\text{, }x\in \Omega \end{gather} where $\Sigma$ is a connected surface to which $j$ is tangent and where $\Omega$ is the finite domain bounded by $\Sigma$.
  We answer two questions regarding this operator.
  i) We provide an algorithm which converges (theoretically) exponentially fast to an element of the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator, as well as characterise the elements of the kernel of the Biot-Savart operator in terms of certain solutions to exterior boundary value problems. This allows one to explicitly exploit the non-uniqueness of the coil reconstruction process in the context of stellarator designs.
  ii) We provide a simple, concise characterisation of the image of the Biot-Savart operator. This allows to define a 2-step current reconstruction procedure to obtain surface currents which approximate to arbitrary precision a prescribed target magnetic field within the plasma region of a stellarator device. The first step does not require computing integrals involving singular integral kernels of the form $\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^3}$ but may have a potentially slow convergence rate, while the second step requires the computation of integrals involving singular integral kernels but in turn has (theoretically) an exponential convergence rate. This approximation procedure always leads to approximating surface currents which are as poloidal as possible.</description>

      <title>Semi-Lagrangian methods of a plasma hybrid model with multi-species kinetic ions and massless electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semi-Lagrangian methods with the improved number of one-dimensional advections are proposed for a plasma hybrid model with kinetic ions and mass-less electrons. Two subsystems with mass, momentum, and energy conservation are obtained by a Poisson bracket-based splitting method. For the subsystem in which the distribution functions and the fields are coupled, the second order and reversible modified implicit mid-point rule is used in time with the specially designed mean velocity. The distribution functions are not involved in the iterations and are solved by exact splittings with only one dimensional advections, which makes the proposed schemes efficient. The cancellation problem is overcome by the numerical schemes constructed. Moreover, for the case with a periodic boundary condition, the magnetic field obtained is divergence free, mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. The methods can be extended to cases with multiple ion species.</description>

      <title>Basic Pattern of Three-dimensional Magnetic Reconnection within Strongly Turbulent Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental mechanism of driving eruptive phenomena of different scales and may be coupled with turbulence as suggested by recent remote-sensing and in-situ observations. However, the specific physics behind the complex three-dimensional (3D) turbulent reconnection remains mysterious. Here, we develop a novel methodology to identify and analyze multitudes of multi-scale reconnection fragments within a strongly turbulent current sheet (CS) and apply it to a state-of-the-art numerical simulation of turbulent reconnection for solar flares. It is determined that the reconnection fragments tend to appear as quasi-2D sheets forming along local magnetic flux surfaces, and, due to strong turbulence, their reconnection flow velocities and reconnection rates are significantly broadened statistically but are scale-independent. Each reconnection fragment is found to be surrounded by strongly fluctuated in/out-flows and has a widely distributed reconnection rate, mainly in the range of 0.01-0.1. The results, for the first time, provide quantitative measurements of 3D magnetic reconnection in strongly turbulent flare CSs, offering insights into the cascading laws of 3D reconnection in other turbulent plasmas.</description>

      <title>A parametric study of solar wind properties and composition using fluid and kinetic solar wind models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical processes in the solar corona that shape the solar wind remain an active research topic. Modeling efforts have shown that energy and plasma exchanges near the transition region plays a crucial role in modulating solar wind properties. Although these regions cannot be measured in situ, plasma parameters can be inferred from coronal spectroscopy and ionization states of heavy ions, which remain unchanged as they escape the corona. We introduce a new solar wind model extending from the chromosphere to the inner heliosphere, capturing thermodynamic coupling across atmospheric layers. By including neutral and charged particle interactions, we model the transport and ionisation processes of the gas through the transition region, the corona and into the solar wind. Instead of explicitly modeling coronal heating, we link its spatial distribution to large-scale magnetic field properties. Our results confirm that energy deposition strongly affects wind properties through key mechanisms involving chromospheric evaporation, thermal expansion, and magnetic flux expansion. For sources near active regions, the model predicts significant solar wind acceleration, with plasma outflows comparable to those inferred from coronal spectroscopy. For winds from large coronal holes, the model reproduces the observed anticorrelation between charge state and wind speed. However, the predicted charge state ratios are overall lower than observed. Inclusion of a population of energetic electrons enhances both heavy ion charge states and solar wind acceleration, improving agreement with observations.</description>

Abstract: Evolving magnetic fields are frequently embedded in plasmas that are turbulent. When the primary interest is in effects that are on a large scale compared to that of the turbulence, it is desirable to average over the turbulence to obtain equations for mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. An obvious constraint on the validity of the averaging is that large-scale quantities that evolve slowly using the exact evolution equations must remain slowly evolving in the mean-field theory. Magnetic helicity is the primary example of such a quantity and maintaining its slow evolution has been controversial in mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. A full theory of magnetic reconnection in turbulent plasmas is not the intent of this paper. What is the intent is to show how exact results from Maxwell's equations explain why fast reconnection is so ubiquitous and what constraints these results place on the theory of magnetic field evolution, including dynamos, whether the plasma is turbulent or not. These constraints are commonly broken in the reconnection literature, which has been heavily influenced by two-dimensional theory that is not applicable to three-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Model-free Rayleigh weight from x-ray Thomson scattering measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a powerful tool for the diagnostics of matter under extreme conditions. In principle, it gives one access to important system parameters such as the temperature, density, and ionization state, but the interpretation of the measured XRTS intensity usually relies on theoretical models and approximations. In this work, we show that it is possible to extract the Rayleigh weight -- a key property that describes the electronic localization around the ions -- directly from the experimental data without the need for any model calculations or simulations. As a practical application, we consider an experimental measurement of strongly compressed Be at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) [D\"oppner \emph{et al.}, \textit{Nature} \textbf{618}, 270-275 (2023)]. In addition to being interesting in their own right, our results will open up new avenues for diagnostics from \emph{ab initio} simulations, help to further constrain existing chemical models, and constitute a rigorous benchmark for theory and simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative guiding center model for magnetized plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative guiding center theory adequately describes the slow drift motion of charged particles in the strongly-magnetized regime characteristic of thermal particle populations in various magnetic fusion devices. However, it breaks down for particles with large enough energy. We report on a data-driven method for learning a non-perturbative guiding center model from full-orbit particle simulation data. We show the data-driven model significantly outperforms traditional asymptotic theory in magnetization regimes appropriate for fusion-born $\alpha$-particles in stellarators, thus opening the door to non-perturbative guiding center calculations.</description>

      <title>Distortions in Charged-Particle Images of Laser Direct-Drive Inertial Confinement Fusion Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energetic charged particles generated by inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions encode information about the spatial morphology of the hot-spot and dense fuel during the time of peak fusion reactions. The knock-on deuteron imager (KoDI) was developed at the Omega Laser Facility to image these particles in order to diagnose low-mode asymmetries in the hot-spot and dense fuel layer of cryogenic deuterium--tritium ICF implosions. However, the images collected are distorted in several ways that prevent reconstruction of the deuteron source. In this paper we describe these distortions and a series of attempts to mitigate or compensate for them. We present several potential mechanisms for the distortions, including a new model for scattering of charged particles in filamentary electric or magnetic fields surrounding the implosion. Particle-tracing is used to create synthetic KoDI data based on the filamentary field model that reproduces the main experimentally observed image distortions. We conclude that the filamentary scattering model best matches the observed image distortions. Finally, we discuss potential impacts of filamentary fields on other charged-particle diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Coherently enhanced radiation friction in laser-plasma collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the footprints of radiation friction in a head on collision of a bunch of relativistic charged particles with a laser pulse by demonstrating that in a dense enough bunch forward and backward radiation and radiation friction are coherently enhanced. This should make it possible to observe radiation friction effects in laser-matter interactions at much lower energies and laser intensities than accepted ever previously. A simple estimate for the energy losses of the particles in the bunch over the collision due to radiation friction in terms of laser and bunch parameters is derived and validated by comparing with the results of three dimensional particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>Fusion in a nanoshell: Harnessing plasmonic fields for nuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface of metal nanoparticles can support plasmonic excitations. These excitations dramatically amplify the electric field of incident light (by several orders of magnitude), potentially ionizing the irradiated nanoparticles in a strong field regime. Under specific conditions, a resonant enhancement of the electric field \textit{inside} a hollow nanoshell can be achieved with a laser pulse. We propose high-intensity laser irradiation of heavy water (${\rm D_2 O}$)-filled metal nanoshells to induce nuclear fusion via this enhancement. In this ``plasmonic confinement'' setup, deuteron nuclei are accelerated by the oscillating electric field within the nanoshell. We estimate that the characteristic momenta of the colliding deuterons reach approximately 10 MeV. This corresponds to an effective kinetic energy equivalent to that of deuterons in a thermonuclear plasma at temperatures around 25 keV (approximately $10^8$K). A laser with a peak pulse intensity of roughly 1 atomic unit is sufficient to generate the strong electric fields required for this plasmonic acceleration. We estimate the expected fusion rate and discuss the feasibility of a fusion reactor based on this proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Data-driven construction of a generalized kinetic collision operator from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</description>
