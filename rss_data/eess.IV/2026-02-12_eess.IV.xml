      <title>A Systematic Review on Data-Driven Brain Deformation Modeling for Image-Guided Neurosurgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain deformation is a critical challenge for reliable image-guided neurosurgery, as surgical manipulation and tumor resection induce tissue motion that misaligns preoperative planning images with intraoperative anatomy and longitudinal studies. In this systematic review, we synthesize recent AI-driven approaches developed between January 2020 and April 2025 for modeling and correcting brain deformation. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on computational methods applied to brain deformation compensation for neurosurgical imaging, resulting in 41 studies meeting these criteria. We provide a unified analysis of methodological strategies, including deep learning-based image registration, direct deformation field regression, synthesis-driven multimodal alignment, resection-aware architectures addressing missing correspondences, and hybrid models that integrate biomechanical priors. We also examine dataset utilization, reported evaluation metrics, validation protocols, and how uncertainty and generalization have been assessed across studies. While AI-based deformation models demonstrate promising performance and computational efficiency, current approaches exhibit limitations in out-of-distribution robustness, standardized benchmarking, interpretability, and readiness for clinical deployment. Our review highlights these gaps and outlines opportunities for future research aimed at achieving more robust, generalizable, and clinically translatable deformation compensation solutions for neurosurgical guidance. By organizing recent advances and critically evaluating evaluation practices, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for researchers and clinicians engaged in developing and applying AI-based brain deformation methods.</description>

      <title>Anatomy-Preserving Latent Diffusion for Generation of Brain Segmentation Masks with Ischemic Infarct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality segmentation masks remains a major bottleneck for medical image analysis, particularly in non-contrast CT (NCCT) neuroimaging, where manual annotation is costly and variable. To address this limitation, we propose an anatomy-preserving generative framework for the unconditional synthesis of multi-class brain segmentation masks, including ischemic infarcts.
  The proposed approach combines a variational autoencoder trained exclusively on segmentation masks to learn an anatomical latent representation, with a diffusion model operating in this latent space to generate new samples from pure noise. At inference, synthetic masks are obtained by decoding denoised latent vectors through the frozen VAE decoder, with optional coarse control over lesion presence via a binary prompt.
  Qualitative results show that the generated masks preserve global brain anatomy, discrete tissue semantics, and realistic variability, while avoiding the structural artifacts commonly observed in pixel-space generative models. Overall, the proposed framework offers a simple and scalable solution for anatomy-aware mask generation in data-scarce medical imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Ordinal Deep Learning for cross-Dataset Diabetic Retinopathy Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin production or impaired insulin utilization. One of its most severe complications is diabetic retinopathy (DR), a progressive retinal disease caused by microvascular damage, leading to hemorrhages, exudates, and potential vision loss. Early and reliable detection of DR is therefore critical for preventing irreversible blindness.
  In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for automated DR severity grading that explicitly models the ordinal nature of disease progression. Our approach combines a convolutional backbone with lesion-query attention pooling and an evidential Dirichlet-based ordinal regression head, enabling both accurate severity prediction and principled estimation of predictive uncertainty. The model is trained using an ordinal evidential loss with annealed regularization to encourage calibrated confidence under domain shift.
  We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-domain training setup combining APTOS, Messidor-2, and a subset of EyePACS fundus datasets. Experimental results demonstrate strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving competitive classification accuracy and high quadratic weighted kappa on held-out test sets, while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates for low-confidence cases. These results suggest that ordinal evidential learning is a promising direction for robust and clinically reliable diabetic retinopathy grading.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Model Misspecification in Quantitative MRI: Application to Perfusion ASL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) involves parameter estimation governed by an explicit signal model. However, these models are often confounded and difficult to validate in vivo. A model is misspecified when the assumed signal model differs from the true data-generating process. Under misspecification, the variance of any unbiased estimator is lower-bounded by the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB), and maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) may exhibit bias and inconsistency. Based on these principles, we assess misspecification in qMRI using two tests: (i) examining whether empirical MCRB asymptotically approaches the CRB as repeated measurements increase; (ii) comparing MLE estimates from two equal-sized subsets and evaluating whether their empirical variance aligns with theoretical CRB predictions. We demonstrate the framework using arterial spin labeling (ASL) as an illustrative example. Our result shows the commonly used ASL signal model appears to be specified in the brain and moderately misspecified in the kidney. The proposed framework offers a general, theoretically grounded approach for assessing model validity in quantitative MRI.</description>

      <title>Beyond Calibration: Confounding Pathology Limits Foundation Model Specificity in Abdominal Trauma CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Translating foundation models into clinical practice requires evaluating their performance under compound distribution shift, where severe class imbalance coexists with heterogeneous imaging appearances. This challenge is relevant for traumatic bowel injury, a rare but high-mortality diagnosis. We investigated whether specificity deficits in foundation models are associated with heterogeneity in the negative class. Methods: This retrospective study used the multi-institutional, RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT dataset (2019-2023), comprising scans from 23 centres. Two foundation models (MedCLIP, zero-shot; RadDINO, linear probe) were compared against three task-specific approaches (CNN, Transformer, Ensemble). Models were trained on 3,147 patients (2.3% bowel injury prevalence) and evaluated on an enriched 100-patient test set. To isolate negative-class effects, specificity was assessed in patients without bowel injury who had concurrent solid organ injury (n=58) versus no abdominal pathology (n=50). Results: Foundation models achieved equivalent discrimination to task-specific models (AUC, 0.64-0.68 versus 0.58-0.64) with higher sensitivity (79-91% vs 41-74%) but lower specificity (33-50% vs 50-88%). All models demonstrated high specificity in patients without abdominal pathology (84-100%). When solid organ injuries were present, specificity declined substantially for foundation models (50-51 percentage points) compared with smaller reductions of 12-41 percentage points for task-specific models. Conclusion: Foundation models matched task-specific discrimination without task-specific training, but their specificity deficits were driven primarily by confounding negative-class heterogeneity rather than prevalence alone. Susceptibility to negative-class heterogeneity decreased progressively with labelled training, suggesting adaptation is required before clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Learning and Statistical Target Detection Methods for PFM-1 Landmine Detection in UAV Hyperspectral Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with imaging sensors and automated processing algorithms have emerged as a promising tool to accelerate large-area surveys while reducing risk to human operators. Although hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables material discrimination using spectral signatures, standardized benchmarks for UAV-based landmine detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of four classical statistical detection algorithms, including Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Matched Filter (MF), Adaptive Cosine Estimator (ACE), and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), alongside a proposed lightweight Spectral Neural Network utilizing Parametric Mish activations for PFM-1 landmine detection. We also release pixel-level binary ground truth masks (target/background) to enable standardized, reproducible evaluation. Evaluations were conducted on inert PFM-1 targets across multiple scene crops using a recently released VNIR hyperspectral dataset. Metrics such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), precision-recall (PR) curve, and average precision (AP) were used. While all methods achieve high ROC-AUC on an independent test set, the ACE method observes the highest AUC of 0.989. However, because target pixels are extremely sparse relative to background, ROC-AUC alone can be misleading; under precision-focused evaluation (PR and AP), the Spectral-NN outperforms classical detectors, achieving the highest AP. These results emphasize the need for precision-focused evaluation, scene-aware benchmarking, and learning-based spectral models for reliable UAV-based hyperspectral landmine detection. The code and pixel-level annotations will be released.</description>

      <title>FPGA Implementation of Sketched LiDAR for a 192 x 128 SPAD Image Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of a polynomial spline function-based statistical compression algorithm designed to address the critical challenge of massive data transfer bandwidth in emerging high-spatial-resolution single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, where data rates can reach tens of gigabytes per second. In our experiments, the proposed hardware implementation achieves a compression ratio of 512x compared with conventional histogram-based outputs, with the potential for further improvement. The algorithm is first optimized in software using fixed-point (FXP) arithmetic and look-up tables (LUTs) to eliminate explicit additions, multiplications, and non-linear operations. This enables a careful balance between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. Guided by this trade-off analysis, online sketch processing elements (SPEs) are implemented on an FPGA to directly process time-stamp streams from the SPAD sensor. The implementation is validated using a customized LiDAR setup with a 192 x 128-pixel SPAD array. This work demonstrates histogram-free online depth reconstruction with high fidelity, effectively alleviating the time-stamp transfer bottleneck of SPAD arrays and offering scalability as pixel counts continue to increase for future SPADs.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Stimulus Encoding for Retinal Implants via Sparse Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retinal implants aim to restore functional vision despite photoreceptor degeneration, yet are fundamentally constrained by low resolution electrode arrays and patient-specific perceptual distortions. Most deployed encoders rely on task-agnostic downsampling and linear brightness-to-amplitude mappings, which are suboptimal under realistic perceptual models. While global inverse problems have been formulated as neural networks, such approaches can be fast at inference, and can achieve high reconstruction fidelity, but require training and have limited generalizability to arbitrary inputs. We cast stimulus encoding as a constrained sparse least-squares problem under a linearized perceptual forward model. Our key observation is that the resulting perception matrix can be highly sparse, depending on patient and implant configuration. Building on this, we apply an efficient projected residual norm steepest descent solver that exploits sparsity and supports stimulus bounds via projection. In silico experiments across four simulated patients and implant resolutions from $15\times15$ to $100\times100$ electrodes demonstrate improved reconstruction fidelity, with up to $+0.265$ SSIM increase, $+12.4\,\mathrm{dB}$ PSNR, and $81.4\%$ MAE reduction on Fashion-MNIST compared to Lanczos downsampling.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Security of Diffusion-based Generative Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative image steganography is a technique that conceals secret messages within generated images, without relying on pre-existing cover images. Recently, a number of diffusion model-based generative image steganography (DM-GIS) methods have been introduced, which effectively combat traditional steganalysis techniques. In this paper, we identify the key factors that influence DM-GIS security and revisit the security of existing methods. Specifically, we first provide an overview of the general pipelines of current DM-GIS methods, finding that the noise space of diffusion models serves as the primary embedding domain. Further, we analyze the relationship between DM-GIS security and noise distribution of diffusion models, theoretically demonstrating that any steganographic operation that disrupts the noise distribution compromise DM-GIS security. Building on this insight, we propose a Noise Space-based Diffusion Steganalyzer (NS-DSer)-a simple yet effective steganalysis framework allowing for detecting DM-GIS generated images in the diffusion model noise space. We reevaluate the security of existing DM-GIS methods using NS-DSer across increasingly challenging detection scenarios. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis of DM-GIS security and show the effectiveness of NS-DSer across diverse detection scenarios.</description>

      <title>Binary Flow Matching: Prediction-Loss Space Alignment for Robust Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.</description>

      <title>Robust Semantic Transmission for Low-Altitude UAVs: Predictive Channel-Aware Scheduling and Generative Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) downlink transmission facilitates critical time-sensitive visual applications but is fundamentally constrained by bandwidth scarcity and dynamic channel impairments. The rapid fluctuation of the air-to-ground (A2G) link creates a regime where reliable transmission slots are intermittent and future channel quality can only be predicted with uncertainty. Conventional deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) methods transmit coupled feature streams, causing global reconstruction failure when specific time slots experience deep fading. Decoupling semantic content into a deterministic structure component and a stochastic texture component enables differentiated error protection strategies aligned with channel reliability. A predictive transmission framework is developed that utilizes a split-stream variational codec and a channel-aware scheduler to prioritize the delivery of structural layout over reliable slots. Experimental evaluations indicate that this approach achieves a 5.6 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio over single-stream baselines and maintains structural fidelity under significant prediction mismatch.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Underwater Images via Adaptive Semantic-aware Codebook Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is an ill-posed problem where natural clean references are not available, and the degradation levels vary significantly across semantic regions. Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics. The code will be made public available at https://github.com/oucailab/SUCode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new benchmark for evaluating stereoscopic visual-inertial computer vision algorithms (SLAM/ SfM/ 3D Reconstruction/ Visual-Inertial Odometry) for minimally invasive surgical (MIS) interventions in the abdomen. Our MITI Dataset available at [https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1621941] provides all the necessary data by a complete recording of a handheld surgical intervention at Research Hospital Rechts der Isar of TUM. It contains multimodal sensor information from IMU, stereoscopic video, and infrared (IR) tracking as ground truth for evaluation. Furthermore, calibration for the stereoscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, the rigid transformations in the sensor setup, and time-offsets are available. We wisely chose a suitable intervention that contains very few cutting and tissue deformation and shows a full scan of the abdomen with a handheld camera such that it is ideal for testing SLAM algorithms. Intending to promote the progress of visual-inertial algorithms designed for MIS application, we hope that our clinical training dataset helps and enables researchers to enhance algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The lung airway tree modeling is essential to work for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases, especially for X-Ray computed tomography (CT). The airway tree modeling on CT images can provide the experts with 3-dimension measurements like wall thickness, etc. This information can tremendously aid the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1-4]. Many scholars have attempted various ways to model the lung airway tree, which can be split into two major categories based on its nature. Namely, the model-based approach and the deep learning approach. The performance of a typical model-based approach usually depends on the manual tuning of the model parameter, which can be its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is its don't require a large amount of training data which can be beneficial for a small dataset like medical imaging. On the other hand, the performance of model-based may be a misconcep-tion [5,6].
  In recent years, deep learning has achieved good results in the field of medical image processing, and many scholars have used UNet-based methods in medical image segmentation [7-11]. Among all the variation of UNet, the UNet 3+ [11] have relatively good result compare to the rest of the variation of UNet. Therefor to further improve the accuracy of lung airway tree modeling, this study combines the Frangi filter [5] with UNet 3+ [11] to develop a dual-channel 3D UNet 3+. The Frangi filter is used to extracting vessel-like feature. The vessel-like feature then used as input to guide the dual-channel UNet 3+ training and testing procedures.</description>

      <title>Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM): Instance Deformation for Image Manipulation and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In medical imaging, the diffusion models have shown great potential for synthetic image generation tasks. However, these approaches often lack the interpretable connections between the generated and real images and can create anatomically implausible structures or illusions. To address these limitations, we propose the Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), a novel diffusion-based generative model that emphasises morphological transformation through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. DRDM introduces a topology-preserving deformation field generation strategy, which randomly samples and integrates multi-scale Deformation Velocity Fields (DVFs). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unrealistic deformation components, thus restoring randomly deformed images to a realistic distribution. This formulation enables the generation of diverse yet anatomically plausible deformations that preserve structural integrity, thereby improving data augmentation and synthesis for downstream tasks such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experiments on cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging and pulmonary Computed Tomography show that DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large-scale deformations, while maintaining anatomical plausibility of deformation fields. Additional evaluations on 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration tasks indicate notable performance gains, underscoring DRDM's potential to enhance both image manipulation and generative modelling in medical imaging applications.

      <title>Accurate, provable and fast polychromatic tomographic reconstruction: A variational inequality approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of signal reconstruction for computed tomography (CT) under a nonlinear forward model that accounts for exponential signal attenuation, a polychromatic X-ray source, general measurement noise (e.g., Poisson shot noise), and observations acquired over multiple wavelength windows. We develop a simple iterative algorithm for single-material reconstruction, which we call EXACT (EXtragradient Algorithm for Computed Tomography), based on formulating our estimate as the fixed point of a monotone variational inequality. We prove guarantees on the statistical and computational performance of EXACT under realistic assumptions on the measurement process. We also consider a recently introduced variant of this model with Gaussian measurements and present sample and iteration complexity bounds for EXACT that improve upon those of existing algorithms. We apply our EXACT algorithm to a CT phantom image recovery task and show that it often requires fewer X-ray views, lower source intensity, and less computation time to achieve reconstruction quality similar to existing methods.

      <title>A UAV-Based VNIR Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset for Landmine and UXO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic induction (EMI) data from the same test field.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using Doob's $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by learning the optimal control, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the control using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling, inverse problems and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>GenDR: Lighten Generative Detail Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although recent research applying text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to real-world super-resolution (SR) has achieved remarkable progress, the misalignment of their targets leads to a suboptimal trade-off between inference speed and detail fidelity. Specifically, the T2I task requires multiple inference steps to synthesize images matching to prompts and reduces the latent dimension to lower generating difficulty. Contrariwise, SR can restore high-frequency details in fewer inference steps, but it necessitates a more reliable variational auto-encoder (VAE) to preserve input information. However, most diffusion-based SRs are multistep and use 4-channel VAEs, while existing models with 16-channel VAEs are overqualified diffusion transformers, e.g., FLUX (12B). To align the target, we present a one-step diffusion model for generative detail restoration, GenDR, distilled from a tailored diffusion model with a larger latent space. In detail, we train a new SD2.1-VAE16 (0.9B) via representation alignment to expand the latent space without increasing the model size. Regarding step distillation, we propose consistent score identity distillation (CiD) that incorporates SR task-specific loss into score distillation to leverage more SR priors and align the training target. Furthermore, we extend CiD with adversarial learning and representation alignment (CiDA) to enhance perceptual quality and accelerate training. We also polish the pipeline to achieve a more efficient inference. Experimental results demonstrate that GenDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Spectrum from Defocus: Fast Spectral Imaging with Chromatic Focal Stack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral cameras face harsh trade-offs between spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution in inherently low-photon conditions. Computational imaging systems break through these trade-offs with compressive sensing, but have required complex optics and/or extensive compute. We present Spectrum from Defocus (SfD), a chromatic focal sweep method that achieves state-of-the-art hyperspectral imaging with only two off-the-shelf lenses, a grayscale sensor, and less than one second of reconstruction time. By capturing a chromatically-aberrated focal stack that preserves nearly all incident light, and reconstructing it with a fast physics-based iterative algorithm, SfD delivers sharp, accurate hyperspectral images. The combination of photon efficiency, optical simplicity, and physical interpretability makes SfD a promising solution for fast, compact, interpretable hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>A New Dataset and Performance Benchmark for Real-time Spacecraft Segmentation in Onboard Computers</title>

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the images. Our dataset includes images with several real-world challenges, including noise, camera distortions, glare, varying lighting conditions, varying field of view, partial spacecraft visibility, brightly-lit city backgrounds, densely patterned and confounding backgrounds, aurora borealis, and a wide variety of spacecraft geometries. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models for spacecraft segmentation to generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of 0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second. The dataset and models for performance benchmark are available at https://github.com/RiceD2KLab/SWiM.</description>

      <title>HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image reconstruction in radio interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure (FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularization step via learned denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension, underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighboring channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained with a Jacobian regularization enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a variant of the optimization-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity across spectral channels via the $\ell_{2,1}$-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its superior performance compared to its optimization-based counterpart Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for geometry-independent operator learning in cardiac electrophysiology simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning neural operators on heterogeneous and irregular geometries remains a fundamental challenge, as existing approaches typically rely on structured discretisations or explicit mappings to a shared reference domain. We propose a unified framework for geometry-independent operator learning that reformulates the learning problem in an intrinsic coordinate space defined on the underlying manifold. By expressing both inputs and outputs in this shared coordinate domain, the framework decouples operator learning from mesh discretisation and geometric variability, while preserving meaningful spatial organisation and enabling faithful reconstruction on the original geometry.
  We demonstrate the framework on cardiac electrophysiology, a particularly challenging setting due to extreme anatomical variability across heart geometries. Leveraging a GPU-accelerated simulation pipeline, we generate large-scale datasets of high-fidelity electrophysiology simulations across diverse patient-specific anatomies and train customised neural operators to predict full-field local activation time maps. The proposed approach outperforms established neural operators on both atrial and ventricular geometries. Beyond cardiac electrophysiology, we further show that the same representation enables operator learning in cardiac biomechanics, a distinct problem involving volumetric deformation, highlighting the generality of the proposed framework. Together, these results establish intrinsic coordinate representations as a principled and extensible pathway for neural operator learning on complex physical systems characterised by heterogeneous geometry.</description>

      <title>Shortest-Path Flow Matching with Mixture-Conditioned Bases for OOD Generalization to Unseen Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains a key challenge for conditional generative modeling: conditional flow-based methods often fit the training conditions well but fail to extrapolate to unseen ones. We introduce SP-FM, a shortest-path flow-matching framework that improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by conditioning both the base distribution and the flow field on the condition. Specifically, SP-FM learns a condition-dependent base distribution parameterized as a flexible, learnable mixture, together with a condition-dependent vector field trained via shortest-path flow matching. Conditioning the base allows the model to adapt its starting distribution across conditions, enabling smooth interpolation and more reliable extrapolation beyond the observed training range. We provide theoretical insights into the resulting conditional transport and show how mixture-conditioned bases enhance robustness under shift. Empirically, SP-FM is effective across heterogeneous domains, including predicting responses to unseen perturbations in single-cell transcriptomics and modeling treatment effects in high-content microscopy--based drug screening. Overall, SP-FM provides a simple yet effective plug-in strategy for improving conditional generative modeling and OOD generalization across diverse domains.</description>
