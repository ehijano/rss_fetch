      <title>Quantifying the irregularity of a time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce circulance, a scalar measure for classifying time series of dynamical systems. Circulance captures the extent of temporal regularity or irregularity that is encoded in the topology of a directed ordinal pattern transition network derived from a time series. We demonstrate numerically that circulance sensitively and robustly positions time series of canonical model systems, representative of preset dynamical regimes, along a continuous spectrum from regularity to randomness. Analyzing empirical data from long-term observations of high-dimensional, complex systems -- human brain and the Sun -- reveals that circulance aids in elucidating different dynamical regimes.</description>

      <title>Delay as an energy regulator of the generation of deterministic chaos in hydrodynamic systems with limited excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Miles-Krasnopolskaya system is considered, which is used to study the nonlinear interaction of a tank with a liquid and the source of excitation of its oscillations. Additionally, delay time of impulse from the source of excitation of oscillations on the dynamics of the aggregate system "tank with liquid - source of excitation" is taken into account. A technique for studying the attractors of such systems is proposed.
  It is shown that delay plays a key role in the emergence (disappearance) of deterministic chaos in the Miles-Krasnopolskaya system. Quantitative changes in the value of the delay can lead to qualitative changes in the types of attractors of the system. So, regular attractors can turn into chaotic ones and vice versa. Also, a change in the delay value can lead to the implementation of new scenarios, both transitions from regular attractors to chaotic ones and transitions from a chaotic attractor of one type to a chaotic attractor of another type.</description>

      <title>On mathematical aspects of surface correction via ion beam etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the ion beam dwell time calculation problem in Ion Beam Figuring we suggest a mathematical framework for solving a specific type of inverse problems, which appear in various areas of applied mathematics and physics. From the point of view of functional analysis we deal with a linear operator equation, which, taking advantage of the observation that the associated operator, acting from the space of dwell times into the space of measurement data, is close to a finite-dimensional one, can be solved employing the pseudoinverse operator. For the main case of interest we describe the behavior of the singular vectors inside the domain, on which measurement data are given, which turn out to be close to functions $e^{ikx}$. Heuristically, these singular vectors are similar to eigenfunctions of the infinitely deep quantum well. An alternative problem formulation, closer to practical calculations, utilizes reconstructing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and radial basis functions, which are used for pointwise approximation of measurement data and ensuing dwell time determination. Depending on the particularities of the concrete problem either framework or a suitable combination of each can be used.</description>

      <title>Alterations of brain tissue structural complexity and disorder in Parkinson disease (PD): Fractal, multifractal, fractal transformation, and disorder strength analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) is marked by progressive neurodegeneration, yet early and subtle structural alterations in brain tissue remain difficult to detect with conventional imaging and analytical methods. Fractal and multifractal frameworks offer a principled way to quantify complex biological architecture, but their diagnostic utility in PD has been largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the fractal and multifractal characteristics of human brain tissues to identify structural alterations associated with PD. Alongside conventional fractal and multifractal analysis, we employed a recently developed fractal functional distribution method that transforms distributions into a Gaussian form, thereby enhancing quantification. Using this combined approach, we found notable deviations across multiple distribution metrics in PD samples, offering potential for quantitative staging and diagnostic applications. The multifractal analysis revealed threshold-dependent variations in intensity-based measures, which are linked to the sparsity and heterogeneity of neural tissue and suggestive of potential biomarker value. Additionally, we applied inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis to assess structural disorder, demonstrating that larger IPR pixel sizes correlate with increased structural complexity during disease progression. These complementary analyses outline a multi-layered quantitative profile of PD-related tissue disruption, offering a foundation for earlier, objective assessment of disease-associated microstructural change.</description>

      <title>Geometry protected probabilistic structure in many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insomuch as statistical mechanics circumvents the formidable task of addressing many-body dynamics, it remains a challenge to derive macroscopic properties from a solution to Hamiltonian equations for microscopic motion of an isolated system. Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume. Our findings may have applications in nonlinear optics and cold-atom dynamics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry, Invariant Manifolds and Flow Reversals in Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how symmetry, exact coherent structures (ECSs), and their invariant manifolds organize spontaneous flow reversals in a 2D active nematic confined to a periodic channel. In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Alterations of brain tissue structural complexity and disorder in Alzheimer's disease (AD): Fractal, multifractal, fractal transformation, and disorder strength analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive microstructural deterioration in brain tissue, yet conventional imaging and histopathology often lack the sensitivity needed to detect subtle early-stage changes. Here, we present a multiparametric framework combining fractal and multifractal analysis and their distributions to quantify structural alterations in human brain tissue affected by AD. Moreover, from the fractal and multifractal formalism, we introduced an innovative fractal functional distribution method, a novel technique that transforms fractal distribution into a Gaussian form. Statistically, these distribution parameters are easy to interpret and can distinguish between control and diseased tissues. Across samples, we identify pronounced threshold-dependent behavior of fractal and multifractal parameters, reflecting the intrinsic sparsity and heterogeneous intensity landscape of brain tissue. These threshold-sensitive signatures provide a framework for quantitative stage detection and may serve as biomarkers for early pathological transitions. In addition, we studied structural disorder and complexity using our established light localization technique, inverse participation ratio (IPR) analysis. IPR-based analysis demonstrates that increasing IPR pixel size highlights the elevation of structural alterations with disease progression. Together, these integrative analyses establish a robust, multi-scale quantitative framework for detecting microstructural alterations in AD, providing a promising foundation for early diagnosis and improved pathological assessment.</description>

      <title>Shock trapping and inertial escape: Dust-particle clustering in compressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and clustering of dust particles with inertia in shock-dominated compressible turbulence using the two-dimensional, stochastically forced Burgers equation. At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.</description>

      <title>How Far Can We Trust Chaos? Extending the Horizon of Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaos reveals a fundamental paradox in the scientific understanding of Complex Systems. Although chaotic models may be mathematically deterministic, they are practically non-determinable due to the finite precision, which is inherent in all computational machines. Beyond the horizon of predictability, numerical computations accumulate errors, often undetectable. We investigate the possibility of reliable (error-free) time series of chaos. We prove that this is feasible for two well-studied isomorphic chaotic maps, namely the Tent map and the Logistic map. The generated chaotic time series have unlimited horizon of predictability. A new linear formula for the horizon of predictability of the Analytic Computation of the Logistic map, for any given precision and acceptable error, is obtained. Reliable (error-free) time series of chaos serve as gold standard for chaos applications. The practical significance of our findings include: (i) the ability to compare the performance of neural networks that predict chaotic time series, (ii) the reliability and numerical accuracy of chaotic orbit computations in encryption, maintaining high cryptographic strength, and (iii) the reliable forecasting of future prices in chaotic economic and financial models.</description>

Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-matter systems that exhibit two-photon interactions have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring quantum applications. In this work, we focus on the two-photon Dicke model, a system of significant experimental relevance that displays spectral collapse and undergoes a phase transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.</description>

      <title>Space-time resonances in the spatiotemporal spectrum of nonlinear dispersive waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In weakly nonlinear dispersive wave systems, long-time dynamics are typically governed by time resonances, where wave phases evolve coherently due to exact frequency matching. Recent advances in spatio-temporal spectrum measurements, however, reveal prominent features that go beyond the predictions of time resonance theory. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to interpret these signatures by identifying and characterizing an alternative mechanism: space resonances. These arise when wave packets share the same group velocity and remain co-located, leading to long-lived interactions. We further show that gauge-breaking terms in the Hamiltonian give rise to space resonances supported on negative frequencies. By combining sea-surface elevation data, numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we derive the leading-order spatio-temporal spectrum for weakly interacting water waves, providing a unified explanation for its observed features.</description>
