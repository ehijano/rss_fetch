      <title>Silent Abandonment in Text-Based Contact Centers: Identifying, Quantifying, and Mitigating its Operational Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08869v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest to improve services, companies offer customers the option to interact with agents via texting. Such contact centers face unique challenges compared to traditional call centers, as measuring customer experience proxies like abandonment and patience involves uncertainty. A key source of this uncertainty is silent abandonment, where customers leave without notifying the system, wasting agent time and leaving their status unclear. Silent abandonment also obscures whether a customer was served or left. Our goals are to measure the magnitude of silent abandonment and mitigate its effects. Classification models show that 3%-70% of customers across 17 companies abandon silently. In one study, 71.3% of abandoning customers did so silently, reducing agent efficiency by 3.2% and system capacity by 15.3%, incurring $5,457 in annual costs per agent. We develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate customer patience under uncertainty and identify influencing covariates. We find that companies should use classification models to estimate abandonment scope and our EM algorithm to assess patience. We suggest strategies to operationally mitigate the impact of silent abandonment by predicting suspected silent-abandonment behavior or changing service design. Specifically, we show that while allowing customers to write while waiting in the queue creates a missing data challenge, it also significantly increases patience and reduces service time, leading to reduced abandonment and lower staffing requirements.</description>

      <title>Predict Confidently, Predict Right: Abstention in Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems can be modeled as dynamic graphs, where nodes and edges evolve over time, requiring specialized models to capture their evolving dynamics in risk-sensitive applications effectively. Temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such category of specialized models. For the first time, our approach integrates a reject option strategy within the framework of GNNs for continuous-time dynamic graphs. This allows the model to strategically abstain from making predictions when the uncertainty is high and confidence is low, thus minimizing the risk of critical misclassification and enhancing the results and reliability. We propose a coverage-based abstention prediction model to implement the reject option that maximizes prediction within a specified coverage. It improves the prediction score for link prediction and node classification tasks. Temporal GNNs deal with extremely skewed datasets for the next state prediction or node classification task. In the case of class imbalance, our method can be further tuned to provide a higher weightage to the minority class. Exhaustive experiments are presented on four datasets for dynamic link prediction and two datasets for dynamic node classification tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving the reliability and area under the curve (AUC)/ average precision (AP) scores for predictions in dynamic graph scenarios. The results highlight our model's ability to efficiently handle the trade-offs between prediction confidence and coverage, making it a dependable solution for applications requiring high precision in dynamic and uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Navigating Gender Disparities in Communication Research Leadership: Academic Recognition, Career Development, and Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08401v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines gender disparities in communication research through citation metrics, authorship patterns, team composition, and faculty salaries. Using data from 62,359 papers across 121 communication journals, we find that while female authors are increasingly represented, citation gaps persist, with sole-authored papers by women receiving fewer citations than those by men, especially in smaller teams. Team composition analysis reveals a tendency toward gender homophily, with single-gender teams being more common. In top U.S. communication journals, female authors face underrepresentation and citation disparities favoring male authors. Salary analysis from leading U.S. public universities shows that female faculty earn lower salaries at the Assistant Professor level, though disparities lessen at higher ranks. These findings highlight the need for greater efforts to promote gender equity through inclusive collaboration, equitable citation practices, and fair compensation.</description>

      <title>Active Sampling for Node Attribute Completion on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node attribute, a type of crucial information for graph analysis, may be partially or completely missing for certain nodes in real world applications. Restoring the missing attributes is expected to benefit downstream graph learning. Few attempts have been made on node attribute completion, but a novel framework called Structure-attribute Transformer (SAT) was recently proposed by using a decoupled scheme to leverage structures and attributes. SAT ignores the differences in contributing to the learning schedule and finding a practical way to model the different importance of nodes with observed attributes is challenging. This paper proposes a novel AcTive Sampling algorithm (ATS) to restore missing node attributes. The representativeness and uncertainty of each node's information are first measured based on graph structure, representation similarity and learning bias. To select nodes as train samples in the next optimization step, a weighting scheme controlled by Beta distribution is then introduced to linearly combine the two properties. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets and two downstream tasks have shown the superiority of ATS in node attribute completion.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Update Processes Shape Information Cascades in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common assumption in the literature on information diffusion is that populations are homogeneous regarding individuals' information acquisition and propagation process: Individuals update their informed and actively communicating state either through imitation (simple contagion) or peer influence (complex contagion). Here, we study the impact of the mixing and placement of individuals with different update processes on how information cascades in social networks. We consider Simple Spreaders, which take information from a random neighbor and communicate it, and Threshold-based Spreaders, which require a threshold number of active neighbors to change their state to active communication. Even though, in a population made exclusively of Simple Spreaders, information reaches all elements of any (connected) network, we show that, when Simple and Threshold-based Spreaders coexist and occupy random positions in a social network, the number of Simple Spreaders systematically amplifies the cascades only in degree heterogeneous networks (exponential and scale-free). In random and modular structures, this cascading effect originated by Simple Spreaders only exists above a critical mass of these individuals. In contrast, when Threshold-based Spreaders are assorted preferentially in the nodes with a higher degree, the cascading effect of Simple Spreaders vanishes, and the spread of information is drastically impaired. Overall, the study highlights the significance of the strategic placement of different roles in networked structures, with Simple Spreaders driving widespread cascades in heterogeneous networks and Threshold-based Spreaders playing a critical regulatory role in information spread with a tunable effect based on the threshold value.</description>

      <title>Homophily-aware Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graph pre-training (HGP) has demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, the issue of heterophily in real-world heterogeneous graphs (HGs) has been largely overlooked. To bridge this research gap, we proposed a novel heterogeneous graph contrastive learning framework, termed HGMS, which leverages connection strength and multi-view self-expression to learn homophilous node representations. Specifically, we design a heterogeneous edge dropping augmentation strategy that enhances the homophily of augmented views. Moreover, we introduce a multi-view self-expressive learning method to infer the homophily between nodes. In practice, we develop two approaches to solve the self-expressive matrix. The solved self-expressive matrix serves as an additional augmented view to provide homophilous information and is used to identify false negatives in contrastive loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HGMS across different downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Self-adaptive Anchor Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event prediction tasks often handle spatio-temporal data distributed in a large spatial area. Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards a performance characteristic curve for model evaluation: an application in information diffusion prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information diffusion prediction on social networks aims to predict future recipients of a message, with practical applications in marketing and social media. While different prediction models all claim to perform well, general frameworks for performance evaluation remain limited. Here, we aim to identify a performance characteristic curve for a model, which captures its performance on tasks of different complexity. We propose a metric based on information entropy to quantify the randomness in diffusion data. We then identify a scaling pattern between the randomness and the prediction accuracy of the model. By properly adjusting the variables, data points by different sequence lengths, system sizes, and randomness can all collapse into a single curve. The curve captures a model's inherent capability of making correct predictions against increased uncertainty, which we regard as the performance characteristic curve of the model. The validity of the curve is tested by three prediction models in the same family, reaching conclusions in line with existing studies. In addition, we apply the curve to successfully assess the performance of eight state-of-the-art models, providing a clear and comprehensive evaluation even for models that are challenging to differentiate with conventional metrics. Our work reveals a pattern underlying the data randomness and prediction accuracy. The performance characteristic curve provides a new way to evaluate models' performance systematically, and sheds light on future studies on other frameworks for model evaluation.</description>

      <title>ABCD: Algorithm for Balanced Component Discovery in Signed Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The largest balanced element in signed graphs plays a vital role in helping researchers understand the fundamental structure of the graph, as it reveals valuable information about the complex relationships between vertices in the network. The challenge is an NP-hard problem; there is no current baseline to evaluate state-of-the-art signed graphs derived from real networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable state-of-the-art approach for the maximum balanced sub-graph detection in the network of any size. The proposed approach finds the largest balanced sub-graph by considering only the top $K$ balanced states with the lowest frustration index. We show that the ABCD method selects a subset from an extensive signed network with millions of vertices and edges, and the size of the discovered subset is double that of the state-of-the-art in a similar time frame.</description>

      <title>Scaling Frustration Index and Corresponding Balanced State Discovery for Real Signed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural balance modeling for signed graph networks presents how to model the sources of conflicts. The state-of-the-art focuses on computing the frustration index of a signed graph, a critical step toward solving problems in social and sensor networks and scientific modeling. The proposed approaches do not scale to large signed networks of tens of millions of vertices and edges. This paper proposes two efficient algorithms, a tree-based \emph{graphBpp} and a gradient descent-based \emph{graphL}. We show that both algorithms outperform state-of-art in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for discovering the balanced state for \emph{any} network size. We introduce the first comparison for large graphs for the exact, tree-based, and gradient descent-based methods. The speedup of the methods is around \emph{300+ times faster} than the state-of-the-art for large signed graphs. We find that the exact method excels at optimally finding the frustration for small graphs only. \emph{graphBpp} scales this approximation to large signed graphs at the cost of accuracy. \emph{graphL} produces a state with a lower frustration at the cost of selecting a proper variable initialization and hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Taming the Long Tail in Human Mobility Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14970v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the popularity of location-based services, human mobility prediction plays a key role in enhancing personalized navigation, optimizing recommendation systems, and facilitating urban mobility and planning. This involves predicting a user's next POI (point-of-interest) visit using their past visit history. However, the uneven distribution of visitations over time and space, namely the long-tail problem in spatial distribution, makes it difficult for AI models to predict those POIs that are less visited by humans. In light of this issue, we propose the Long-Tail Adjusted Next POI Prediction (LoTNext) framework for mobility prediction, combining a Long-Tailed Graph Adjustment module to reduce the impact of the long-tailed nodes in the user-POI interaction graph and a novel Long-Tailed Loss Adjustment module to adjust loss by logit score and sample weight adjustment strategy. Also, we employ the auxiliary prediction task to enhance generalization and accuracy. Our experiments with two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that LoTNext significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art works.</description>

      <title>Clarify Confused Nodes via Separated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02285v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods. The source code will be available in https://github.com/GISec-Team/NCGNN.</description>

      <title>Negative Ties Highlight Hidden Extremes in Social Media Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human interactions in the online world comprise a combination of positive and negative exchanges. These diverse interactions can be captured using signed network representations, where edges take positive or negative weights to indicate the sentiment of the interaction between individuals. Signed networks offer valuable insights into online political polarization by capturing antagonistic interactions and ideological divides on social media platforms. This study analyzes polarization on Men\'eame, a Spanish social media that facilitates engagement with news stories through comments and voting. Using a dual-method approach -- Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity (SHEEP) for signed networks and Correspondence Analysis (CA) for unsigned networks -- we investigate how including negative ties enhances the understanding of structural polarization levels across different conversation topics on the platform. We find that the unsigned Men\'eame network accurately delineates ideological communities, but negative ties are necessary for detecting extreme users who engage in antagonistic behaviors. We also show that far-left users are more likely to use negative interactions to engage across ideological lines, while far-right users interact primarily with users similar to themselves.</description>
