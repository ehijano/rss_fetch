      <title>Simple Norm Bounds for Polynomial Random Matrices via Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for obtaining norm bounds for random matrices, where each entry is a low-degree polynomial in an underlying set of independent real-valued random variables. Such matrices arise in a variety of settings in the analysis of spectral and optimization algorithms, which require understanding the spectrum of a random matrix depending on data obtained as independent samples.
  Using ideas of decoupling and linearization from analysis, we show a simple way of expressing norm bounds for such matrices, in terms of matrices of lower-degree polynomials corresponding to derivatives. Iterating this method gives a simple bound with an elementary proof, which can recover many bounds previously required more involved techniques.</description>

      <title>Aging and sub-aging for Bouchaud trap models on resistance metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that if a sequence of electrical networks converges in the local Gromov-Hausdorff topology and satisfies a non-explosion condition, then the associated Bouchaud trap models (BTMs) also converge and exhibit aging. Moreover, when local structures of electrical networks converge, we prove sub-aging. Our results are applicable to a wide class of low-dimensional graphs, including the two-dimensional Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket, critical Galton-Watson trees, and the critical Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph. The proof consists of two main steps: Polish metrization of the vague-and-point-process topology and showing the precompactness of transition densities of BTMs.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker on Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following combinatorial two-player game: On the random tree arising from a branching process, each round one player (Breaker) deletes an edge and by that removes the descendant and all its progeny, while the other (Maker) fixates an edge to permanently secure it from deletion. Breaker has won once the tree's root is contained in a finite component, otherwise Maker wins by building an infinite path starting at the root. It will be analyzed both as a positional game (the tree is known to both players at the start) and with more restrictive levels of information (the players essentially explore the tree during the game). Reading the number of available edges for play as a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ allows us to derive the winning probability of Breaker via fixed point equations in three natural information regimes. These results provide new insights into combinatorial game theory and random structures, with potential applications to network theory, algorithmic game design and probability theory.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the set of lumpable Markov chains over a finite state space, with respect to a fixed lumping function, generally does not form an exponential family of stochastic matrices. In this work, we explore efficiently verifiable necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for families of lumpable transition matrices to form exponential families.</description>

      <title>Time discretization of Quadratic Forward-Backward SDEs with singular drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence rate for the time discretization of a class of quadratic backward SDEs -- potentially involving path-dependent terminal values -- when coupled with non-standard Lipschitz-type forward SDEs. In our review of the explicit time-discretization schemes in the spirit of Pag\`es \&amp; Sagna (see \cite{PaSa18}), we achieve an error control close to $\frac{1}{2}$, even under the modest assumptions considered in this work (see \cite{ChaRichou16}, for comparison). A central element of our approach is a thorough re-examination of Zhang's $L^2\text{-time regularity}$ of the martingale integrand $Z$ which follows from an extension of the first-order variational regularity for this class of singular forward-backward SDEs with non-uniform Cauchy-Lipschitz drivers. This is complemented by the recently introduced caracterisation of stochastic processes of {\it bounded mean oscillation} (abbreviated as $\bmo$) by K. L\^e (see \cite{Le22}) which we used to derive an $L^p\text{-version}$ of the strong approximation of SDEs with singular drifts from Dareiotis \&amp; Gerencs\'er (see \cite{DaGe20}). As such, this study addresses a crucial gap in the numerical analysis of forward-backward SDEs (FBSDEs). To our knowledge, for the first time, the impact of regularization by noise on Euler-Maruyama numerical schemes for singular forward SDEs has been successfully transferred to enhance the convergence rate of the discrete time approximations for solutions to backward SDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks conditioned to stay positive. When the mean of increments is zero and variance is finite it is known that they converge to the Rayleigh distribution. In the present paper we derive a Berry-Esseen type estimate and show that the rate of convergence is of order $n^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Lucky cars and lucky spots in parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parking functions correspond with preferences of $n$ cars which enter sequentially to park on a one-way street where (1) each car parks in the first available spot greater than or equal to its preference and (2) all cars successfully park. When a car parks in its preferred spot then the corresponding car and corresponding spot are deemed ``lucky.'' This paper looks briefly at lucky cars which have previously been studied and in simple cases can be understood by a generalization of a result due to Pollak. We also consider lucky spots where the situation is more complex and not previously studied. Probabilities and asymptotics for lucky spots are given for the first few spots on the one-way street. We close with an exploration of the special cases when cars enter the one-way street in either weakly-increasing or weakly-decreasing order of their preferences.</description>

      <title>Homophily Within and Across Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional social network analysis often models homophily--the tendency of similar individuals to form connections--using a single parameter, overlooking finer biases within and across groups. We present an exponential family model that integrates both local and global homophily, distinguishing between strong homophily within tightly knit cliques and weak homophily spanning broader community interactions. By modeling these forms of homophily through a maximum entropy approach and deriving the network behavior under percolation, we show how higher-order assortative mixing influences network dynamics. Our framework is useful for decomposing homophily into finer levels and studying the spread of information and diseases, influence dynamics, and innovation diffusion. We demonstrate that the interaction between different levels of homophily results in complex percolation thresholds. We tested our model on various datasets with distinct homophily patterns, showcasing its applicability. These homophilic connections significantly affect the effectiveness of intervention and mitigation strategies. Hence, our findings have important implications for improving public health measures, understanding information dissemination on social media, and optimizing intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Score Change of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-Neumann Averaging: The DNA of Efficient Gaussian Process Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) and Gaussian random fields (GRFs) are essential for modelling spatially varying stochastic phenomena. Yet, the efficient generation of corresponding realisations on high-resolution grids remains challenging, particularly when a large number of realisations are required. This paper presents two novel contributions. First, we propose a new methodology based on Dirichlet-Neumann averaging (DNA) to generate GPs and GRFs with isotropic covariance on regularly spaced grids. The combination of discrete cosine and sine transforms in the DNA sampling approach allows for rapid evaluations without the need for modification or padding of the desired covariance function. While this introduces an error in the covariance, our numerical experiments show that this error is negligible for most relevant applications, representing a trade-off between efficiency and precision. We provide explicit error estimates for Mat\'ern covariances. The second contribution links our new methodology to the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach for sampling GRFs. We demonstrate that the concepts developed in our methodology can also guide the selection of boundary conditions in the SPDE framework. We prove that averaging specific GRFs sampled via the SPDE approach yields genuinely isotropic realisations without domain extension, with the error bounds established in the first part remaining valid.</description>

      <title>The rapid decay property for pairs of discrete groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of rapid decay property for a group $G$ to pairs of groups $(G,H)$ where $H$ is a finitely generated subgroup of $G$, where typically the subgroup $H$ does not have rapid decay. We deduce some isomorphisms in $K$-theory, and investigate relatively spectral injections in the reduced group $C^*$-algebra. Rapid decay property for the pair $(G,H)$ also gives a lower bound for the probability of return to $H$ of symmetric random walks on $G$.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixing of Data Augmentation Algorithms: Bayesian Probit, Logit, and Lasso Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of the data augmentation (DA) algorithm, the theoretical understanding of its convergence behavior remains incomplete. We prove the first non-asymptotic polynomial upper bounds on mixing times of three important DA algorithms: DA algorithm for Bayesian Probit regression (Albert and Chib, 1993, ProbitDA), Bayesian Logit regression (Polson, Scott, and Windle, 2013, LogitDA), and Bayesian Lasso regression (Park and Casella, 2008, Rajaratnam et al., 2015, LassoDA). Concretely, we demonstrate that with $\eta$-warm start, parameter dimension $d$, and sample size $n$, the ProbitDA and LogitDA require $\mathcal{O}\left(nd\log \left(\frac{\log \eta}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ steps to obtain samples with at most $\epsilon$ TV error, whereas the LassoDA requires $\mathcal{O}\left(d^2(d\log d +n \log n)^2 \log \left(\frac{\eta}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ steps. The results are generally applicable to settings with large $n$ and large $d$, including settings with highly imbalanced response data in the Probit and Logit regression. The proofs are based on the Markov chain conductance and isoperimetric inequalities. Assuming that data are independently generated from either a bounded, sub-Gaussian, or log-concave distribution, we improve the guarantees for ProbitDA and LogitDA to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n+d)$ with high probability, and compare it with the best known guarantees of Langevin Monte Carlo and Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm. We also discuss the mixing times of the three algorithms under feasible initialization.</description>

      <title>Statistical Convergence Rates of Optimal Transport Map Estimation between General Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence rates of optimal transport (OT) map estimators, a topic of growing interest in statistics, machine learning, and various scientific fields. Despite recent advancements, existing results rely on regularity assumptions that are very restrictive in practice and much stricter than those in Brenier's Theorem, including the compactness and convexity of the probability support and the bi-Lipschitz property of the OT maps. We aim to broaden the scope of OT map estimation and fill this gap between theory and practice. Given the strong convexity assumption on Brenier's potential, we first establish the non-asymptotic convergence rates for the original plug-in estimator without requiring restrictive assumptions on probability measures. Additionally, we introduce a sieve plug-in estimator and establish its convergence rates without the strong convexity assumption on Brenier's potential, enabling the widely used cases such as the rank functions of normal or t-distributions. We also establish new Poincar\'e-type inequalities, which are proved given sufficient conditions on the local boundedness of the probability density and mild topological conditions of the support, and these new inequalities enable us to achieve faster convergence rates for the Donsker function class. Moreover, we develop scalable algorithms to efficiently solve the OT map estimation using neural networks and present numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The replicator-mutator equation is a model for populations of individuals carrying different traits, with a fitness function mediating their ability to replicate, and a stochastic model for mutation. We derive analytical solutions for the replicator-mutator equation in continuous time and for continuous traits for a quadratic fitness function. Using these results we can explain and quantify (without the need for numerical in-silico simulations) a series of evolutionary phenomena, in particular the flying kite effect, survival of the flattest, and the ability of a population to sustain itself while tracking an optimal feature which may be fixed, moving with bounded velocity in trait space, oscillating, or randomly fluctuating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove logarithmic growth bounds on Sobolev norms of the focusing mass-critical NLS and gKdV equations on the torus, which hold almost surely under the focusing Gibbs measure with optimal mass threshold constructed by Oh, Sosoe, and Tolomeo. More precisely, we will establish almost sure growth bounds for solutions $u(t)$ of the equations of the form \[ \sup_{t \in [-T,T]} \lVert u(t) \rVert_{H^s(\mathbb{T})} \lesssim_{s, u_0} \log(2+T)\] with initial data $u_0 \in H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&lt; \frac{1}{2}$. The proof uses a generalisation of Bourgain's invariant measure argument for measures in a suitable Orlicz space.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of Dean-Kawasaki type equations on $\mathbb{T}$ with logarithmic repulsive interactions depending on the inverse temperature $\beta$ and a new spectral approximation to the noise part, which approximately features Otto's metric in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{T})$. Following the idea of intrinsic constructions of Brownian motions on the Wasserstein space, we construct a class of particle models whose fluctuating hydrodynamic limits, denoted as $p_t^\beta$, are solutions to the martingale problems of this class of equations. Specifically, we give a quantitative convergence rate of the particle approximation, which allows us to identify a unique limit distribution depending on $\beta$.
  As the inverse temperature rises, the regularizing effect of repulsive interactions becomes stronger. We prove that there exists three thresholds $0&lt;\lambda_0\leq\lambda_1&lt;\lambda_2$ depending on the noise such that, when $\beta&gt;\lambda_0$, $p_t^\beta$ is a non-atomic measure process in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{T})$; when $\beta&gt;\lambda_1$, $p_t^\beta$ is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure almost surely; when $\beta&gt;\lambda_2$, the expectation of the R\'enyi entropy of $p_t^\beta$ satisfies an exponential decay estimate.</description>

      <title>The Milstein scheme for singular SDEs with H\"older continuous drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $L^p$ rate of convergence of the Milstein scheme for SDEs when the drift coefficients possess only H\"older regularity. If the diffusion is elliptic and sufficiently regular, we obtain rates consistent with the additive case. The proof relies on regularisation by noise techniques, particularly stochastic sewing, which in turn requires (at least asymptotically) sharp estimates on the law of the Milstein scheme, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations and Metastability Analysis for Heavy-Tailed Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03479v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces novel frameworks for large deviations and metastability analysis in heavy-tailed stochastic dynamical systems. We develop and apply these frameworks within the context of stochastic difference equation $X^\eta_{j+1}(x) = X^\eta_{j}(x) + \eta a\big( X^\eta_{j}(x)\big) + \eta \sigma\big( X^\eta_{j}(x)\big)Z_{j+1}$ and its variation with truncated dynamics $X^{\eta|b}_{j+1}(x) = X^{\eta|b}_{j}( x) + \varphi_b\big(\eta a\big( X^{\eta|b}_{j}( x)\big) + \eta \sigma\big( X^{\eta|b}_{j}( x)\big) Z_{j+1}\big)$, where $\varphi_b(x) = (x/\|x\|)\max\{\|x\|, b\}$. The truncation operator $\varphi_b(\cdot)$ is often introduced as a modulation mechanism in heavy-tailed systems, such as stochastic gradient descent algorithms in deep learning. Thus, it is crucial to successfully analyze both $X^{\eta}_{j}(x)$ and $X^{\eta|b}_{j}(x)$. We establish locally uniform sample-path large deviations for both processes and translate these asymptotics into precise characterizations of the joint distributions of the first exit times and exit locations. Our large deviations asymptotics are sharp enough to rigorously characterize \emph{the catastrophe principle} by establishing the distributional limit of the sample paths conditional on the rare events of interest, thereby revealing the most likely paths through which rare events arise in heavy-tailed dynamical systems. Moreover the resulting limit theorem unveils a discrete hierarchy of phase transitions (i.e., exit times) as the truncation threshold $b$ varies. Together, these developments serve as a heavy-tailed counterpart of the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory. We also present the corresponding results for continuous-time processes in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Large and moderate deviations for Gaussian neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove large and moderate deviations for the output of Gaussian fully connected neural networks. The main achievements concern deep neural networks (i.e., when the model has more than one hidden layer) and hold for bounded and continuous pre-activation functions. However, for deep neural networks fed by a single input, we have results even if the pre-activation is ReLU. When the network is shallow (i.e., there is exactly one hidden layer) the large and moderate principles hold for quite general pre-activation functions.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Kantorovich Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kantorovich potentials denote the dual solutions of the renowned optimal transportation problem. Uniqueness of these solutions is relevant from both a theoretical and an algorithmic point of view, and has recently emerged as a necessary condition for asymptotic results in the context of statistical and entropic optimal transport. In this work, we challenge the common perception that uniqueness in continuous settings is reliant on the connectedness of the support of at least one of the involved measures, and we provide mild sufficient conditions for uniqueness even when both measures have disconnected support. Since our main finding builds upon the uniqueness of Kantorovich potentials on connected components, we revisit the corresponding arguments and provide generalizations of well-known results. To this end, we introduce the notion of induced regularity and employ it to extend the regularity theory of Kantorovich potentials advanced by Gangbo and McCann (1996) to more general cost functions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and to geodesic spaces.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Low-dimensional Synthetic Data from High-dimensional Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private synthetic data provide a powerful mechanism to enable data analysis while protecting sensitive information about individuals. However, when the data lie in a high-dimensional space, the accuracy of the synthetic data suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a differentially private algorithm to generate low-dimensional synthetic data efficiently from a high-dimensional dataset with a utility guarantee with respect to the Wasserstein distance. A key step of our algorithm is a private principal component analysis (PCA) procedure with a near-optimal accuracy bound that circumvents the curse of dimensionality. Unlike the standard perturbation analysis, our analysis of private PCA works without assuming the spectral gap for the covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Multi-Agent Patrolling with State-Dependent Cost Rates: Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a large-scale patrol problem with state-dependent costs and multi-agent coordination.We consider heterogeneous agents, rather general reward functions, and the capabilities of tracking agents' trajectories.Given the complexity and uncertainty of the practical situations for patrolling, we model the problem as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) that consists of a large number of parallel stochastic processes.We aim to minimize the cumulative patrolling cost over a finite time horizon. The problem exhibits an excessively large size of state space, which increases exponentially in the number of agents and the size of geographical region for patrolling. To reach practical solutions, we relax the dependencies between these parallel stochastic processes by randomizing all the state and action variables. In this context, the entire problem can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems, each of which has a much smaller state space and can be solved independently. The solutions of these sub-problems can lead to efficient heuristics. Unlike the past systems assuming relatively simple structure of the underlying stochastic process, here, tracking the patrol trajectories involves strong dependencies between the stochastic processes, leading to entirely different state and action spaces, transition kernels, and behaviours of processes, rendering the existing methods inapplicable or impractical. Further more, we prove that the performance deviation between the proposed policies and the possible optimal solution diminishes exponentially in the problem size, which also establishes the fact that the policies converge asymptotically at an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>Capital Asset Pricing Model with Size Factor and Normalizing by Volatility Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relates a well-diversified stock portfolio to a benchmark portfolio. We insert size effect in CAPM, capturing the observation that small stocks have higher risk and return than large stocks, on average. Dividing stock index returns by the Volatility Index makes them independent and normal. In this article, we combine these ideas to create a new discrete-time model, which includes volatility, relative size, and CAPM. We fit this model using real-world data, prove the long-term stability, and connect this research to Stochastic Portfolio Theory. We fill important gaps in our previous article on CAPM model with the size factor.</description>
