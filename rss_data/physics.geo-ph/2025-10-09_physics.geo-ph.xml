      <title>Accelerating wave simulations with neural dispersion correctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Fourier neural operator network, designed to correct dispersion errors in numerical wave simulations. The neural dispersion corrector enables the replacement of a computationally expensive high-accuracy simulation by a less expensive low-accuracy simulation. In contrast to neural network surrogates that fully replace a wave equation, the neural dispersion corrector has only a weak dependence on the distribution of model parameters, such as wave speeds. Consequently, the network can be trained with a significantly smaller dataset, while still generalising to unseen input parameters. Following a description of the network architecture and training, we provide examples for the 3-D elastic wave equation. After training with merely 1$\,$000 examples on one GPU, the neural corrector achieves a speed-up of 16$\times$ compared to a reference spectral-element simulation and a generalisation to a broad range of strongly heterogeneous wave speed distributions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Wall Roughness on Coupled Flow and Heat Transport in Fractured Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer in fractured media is governed by the interplay between advective transport along rough-walled fractures and conductive transport, both within the fractures and in the surrounding low-permeability matrix. Flow localization induced by aperture heterogeneity, combined with matrix conduction, gives rise to anomalous thermal behavior. To capture these effects, we develop a stochastic modeling framework that couples a time-domain random walk (TDRW) representation of advective and conductive transport in the fractures with a semi-analytical model of conductive heat exchange with the matrix. Matrix trapping times follow a L\'evy-Smirnov distribution derived from first-passage theory, capturing the heavy-tailed dynamics typical of fractured systems. Heat flux at the fracture-matrix interface is computed via a nonlocal convolution integral based on Duhamel's principle, accounting for thermal memory effects. The model is validated against analytical benchmarks and finite-element simulations. Monte Carlo simulations over stochastic aperture fields quantify the influence of fracture closure, correlation length, and P\'eclet number. Results reveal a transition from superdiffusive to subdiffusive regimes, driven by the competition between advective transport along preferential paths, dispersion induced by aperture variability, and matrix-driven heat conduction. In the long-time regime, heat exchange exhibits a characteristic $t^{-1/2}$ decay. At early times, limited thermal penetration into the matrix leads to weaker interfacial fluxes, underscoring the role of matrix thermal inertia. The proposed framework enables physically consistent and computationally efficient simulations of thermal transport in complex fractured systems, with implications for geothermal energy, subsurface thermal storage, and engineered heat exchange in low-permeability environments.</description>

      <title>Mass Conservation on Rails -- Rethinking Physics-Informed Learning of Ice Flow Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reliably project future sea level rise, ice sheet models require inputs that respect physics. Embedding physical principles like mass conservation into models that interpolate Antarctic ice flow vector fields from sparse &amp; noisy measurements not only promotes physical adherence but can also improve accuracy and robustness. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose physics as soft penalties, offering flexibility but no physical guarantees, we instead propose divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs), which enforce local mass conservation exactly via a vector calculus trick. Our comparison of dfNNs, PINNs, and unconstrained NNs on ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier suggests that "mass conservation on rails" yields more reliable estimates, and that directional guidance, a learning strategy leveraging continent-wide satellite velocity data, boosts performance across models.</description>

      <title>On internal wave whispering gallery modes in channels and critical-slope wave attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal waves are an important feature of stratified fluids, both in oceanic and lake basins and in other settings. Many works have been published on the generic feature of internal wave trapping onto planar wave attractors and super-attractors in 2\&amp;3D and the exceptional class of standing global internal wave modes. However, most of these works did not deal with waves that escape trapping. By using continuous symmetries we analytically prove the existence of internal wave Whispering Gallery Modes (WGMs), internal waves that propagate continuously without getting trapped by attractors. WGMs neutral stability with respect to different perturbations enable whispering gallery beams, a continuum of rays propagating together coherently. The systems' continuous symmetries also enable projection onto 2D planes that yield effective 2D billiards preserving the original dynamics.
  By examining rays deviating from these WGMs in parabolic channels we discover a new type of wave attractor which is located along the channel instead of across it as in previous works. This new wave attractor leads to a re-understanding of WGMs as sitting at the border between the two basins of attraction.
  Finally, both critical-slope wave attractors and whispering gallery beams are used to propose explanations for along-channel energy fluxes in submarine canyons and tidal energy intensification near critical slopes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling and Upscaling of Hydrodynamic Transport in Geological Fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing hydrodynamic transport in fractured rocks is essential for carbon storage and geothermal energy production. Multiscale heterogeneities lead to anomalous solute transport, with breakthrough-curve (BTC) tailing and nonlinear growth of plume moments. We study purely advective transport in synthetic fractures with prescribed relative closure $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $ and correlation length $ L_c $. For each geometry we generate multiple realizations and solve steady, depth-averaged Stokes flow under the lubrication approximation. Flow heterogeneity persists up to $ L_c $. The ensemble-averaged velocity PDFs are insensitive to $ L_c $ but strongly affected by $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $, particularly their low-velocity power-law scaling. A time-domain random walk (TDRW) yields plume moments and outlet BTCs: the mean longitudinal position grows linearly in time, while the variance shows early ballistic scaling and a late-time regime controlled by the low-velocity power law with exponent $ \alpha $, which depends on $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $. BTC properties, including peak broadening and tail scaling, are likewise governed by $ \alpha $. We further model advection with a one-dimensional continuous-time random walk (CTRW) that uses only the velocity PDF, flow tortuosity, and $ L_c $. CTRW results closely match TDRW and enable analytical predictions of asymptotic transport scalings.</description>

      <title>M5 -- Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission: A multi-spacecraft plasma physics mission to Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mars, lacking an intrinsic dynamo, is an ideal laboratory to comparatively study induced magnetospheres, which can be found in other terrestrial bodies as well as comets. Additionally, Mars is of particular interest to further exploration due to its loss of habitability by atmospheric escape and possible future human exploration. In this context, we propose the Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission (M$^5$), a multi-spacecraft mission to study the dynamics and energy transport of the Martian induced magnetosphere comprehensively. Particular focus is dedicated to the largely unexplored magnetotail region, where signatures of magnetic reconnection have been found. Furthermore, a reliable knowledge of the upstream solar wind conditions is needed to study the dynamics of the Martian magnetosphere, especially the different dayside boundary regions but also for energy transport phenomena like the current system and plasma waves. This will aid the study of atmospheric escape processes of planets with induced magnetospheres. In order to resolve the three-dimensional structures varying both in time and space, multi-point measurements are required. Thus, M$^5$ is a five spacecraft mission, with one solar wind monitor orbiting Mars in a circular orbit at 5 Martian radii, and four smaller spacecraft in a tetrahedral configuration orbiting Mars in an elliptical orbit, spanning the far magnetotail up to 6 Mars radii with a periapsis within the Martian magnetosphere of 1.8 Mars radii. We not only present a detailed assessment of the scientific need for such a mission but also show the resulting mission and spacecraft design taking into account all aspects of the mission requirements and constraints such as mass, power, and link budgets. This mission concept was developed during the Alpbach Summer School 2022.</description>

      <title>Lossy Neural Compression for Geospatial Analytics: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.</description>

      <title>Representing Subgrid-Scale Cloud Effects in a Radiation Parameterization using Machine Learning: MLe-radiation v1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improvements of Machine Learning (ML)-based radiation emulators remain constrained by the underlying assumptions to represent horizontal and vertical subgrid-scale cloud distributions, which continue to introduce substantial uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a method to represent the impact of subgrid-scale clouds by applying ML to learn processes from high-resolution model output with a horizontal grid spacing of 5km. In global storm resolving models, clouds begin to be explicitly resolved. Coarse-graining these high-resolution simulations to the resolution of coarser Earth System Models yields radiative heating rates that implicitly include subgrid-scale cloud effects, without assumptions about their horizontal or vertical distributions. We define the cloud radiative impact as the difference between all-sky and clear-sky radiative fluxes, and train the ML component solely on this cloud-induced contribution to heating rates. The clear-sky tendencies remain being computed with a conventional physics-based radiation scheme. This hybrid design enhances generalization, since the machine-learned part addresses only subgrid-scale cloud effects, while the clear-sky component remains responsive to changes in greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations. Applied to coarse-grained data offline, the ML-enhanced radiation scheme reduces errors by a factor of 4-10 compared with a conventional coarse-scale radiation scheme. This shows the potential of representing subgrid-scale cloud effects in radiation schemes with ML for the next generation of Earth System Models.</description>
