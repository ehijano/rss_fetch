      <title>Lattice Defects in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have become a key platform for studying quantum many-body systems. In these setups, defects arise naturally due to various imperfections and can significantly modify the theoretical predictions compared to an ideal model. Here, we investigate the impact of geometric defects in the simplest situation -- a one-dimensional Rydberg atom array, both at and away from its emergent Ising criticality. In the presence of defects, we demonstrate that relevant physical quantities can be extracted from one-point correlation functions. At the critical point, we show that different types of kinks yield distinct outcomes corresponding to their respective spatial-internal symmetries: site-centered kinks can effectively break the array at the kink position regardless of the kink angle, while bond-centered kinks lead to interesting intermediate-coupling fixed points. In the latter case, due to a special renormalization group flow trajectory, the whole system can appear ordered if the system is not large enough. Additionally, away from criticality, the bond-centered kink induces a localization-delocalization transition of the domain wall, characteristic of quantum wetting. These findings highlight the utility of kinks as experimental probes and stress the importance of controlling defects so that experimental observations remain faithful to the pristine model.</description>

      <title>Feshbach spectroscopy of ultracold mixtures of $^{6}{\rm Li}$ and $^{164}{\rm Dy}$ atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of Feshbach resonances in ultracold $^6\mathrm{Li}$-$^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ mixtures, where $^6\mathrm{Li}$ atoms are respectively prepared in their three lowest spin states, and $^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms are prepared in their lowest energy state. We observe 21 interspecies scattering resonances over a magnetic field range from 0 to \SI{702}{\gauss} using atom loss spectroscopy, three of which exhibit relatively broad widths. These broad resonances provide precise control over the interspecies interaction strength, enabling the study of strongly interacting effects in $^6\mathrm{Li}$-$^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ mixtures. Additionally, we observe a well-isolated interspecies resonance at 700.1 G, offering a unique platform to explore novel impurity physics, where heavy dipolar $^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms are immersed in a strongly interacting Fermi superfluid of $^6\mathrm{Li}$ atoms.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases in a flat-top optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic atoms in a large-scale, homogeneous optical lattice provide an ideal quantum simulator for investigating the fermionic Hubbard model, yet achieving this remains challenging. Here, by developing a hybrid potential that integrates a flat-top optical lattice with an optical box trap, we successfully realize the creation of three-dimensional, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases across approximately $8\times10^5$ lattice sites. This homogeneous system enables us to capture a well-defined energy band occupation that aligns perfectly with the theoretical calculations for a zero-temperature, ideal fermionic Hubbard model. Furthermore, by employing novel radio-frequency spectroscopy, we precisely measure the doublon fraction $D$ as a function of interaction strength $U$ and temperature $T$, respectively. The crossover from metal to Mott insulator is detected, where $D$ smoothly decreases with increasing $U$. More importantly, we observe a non-monotonic temperature dependence in $D$, revealing the Pomeranchuk effect and the development of extended antiferromagnetic correlations.</description>

      <title>Thermal behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates of polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the finite-temperature extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (TeGPE) to study a condensate of dipolar NaCs molecules under the conditions of the very recent, breakthrough experiment [Bigagli et.al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We report the condensate fraction of the system, and its density profile after a time-of flight expansion for the coldest experimental case, finding excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. We also report the peak density of the ground state and establish a comparison with the experimental estimates. Our results, derived from the TeGPE formalism, successfully describe the Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing the many-body localized spin-glass phase through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</description>

      <title>Extracting work from coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how work can be extracted from number-state coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. With careful tuning of parameters, a sequence of thermodynamically reversible steps transforms a Glauber coherent state into a thermal state with the same energy probability distribution. The work extracted during this process arises entirely from the removal of quantum coherence. More generally, we characterise quantum (from coherence) and classical (remaining) contributions to work output, and find that in this system the quantum contribution can be dominant over a broad range of parameters. The proportion of quantum work output can be further enhanced by squeezing the initial state. Due to the many-body nature of the system, the work from coherence can equivalently be understood as work from entanglement.</description>

      <title>Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in an ideal Bose gas at thermal equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of ideal gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase regimes with the MBDL and delocalized states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase regimes. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL phase, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>
