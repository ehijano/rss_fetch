      <title>Gabriel-Ulmer Duality for Topoi, An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to relate the classical result of Gabriel-Ulmer to the geometry of topoi. The usage of the attribute 'left exact' when dealing with functors involved in this duality is indeed not casual and it is related to the geometrical side of the story, i.e. topos theory, as in \cite{SGA}. Thought to be a very basic introduction to the subject, it is mostly self-contained. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the fundamentals of category theory, no further prerequisite knowledge is required. The proof of Gabriel-Ulmer duality follows \cite{MP}.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Non-Existence of Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider several types of non-existence theorems for functors. For example, there are no nontrivial functors from the category of groups (or the category of pointed sets, or vector spaces) to any small category. Another type of questions that we consider are questions about nonexistence of subfunctors and quotients of the identity functor on the category of groups (or abelian groups). For example, there is no a natural non-trivial way to define an abelian subgroup of a group, or a perfect quotient group of a group. As an auxiliary result we prove that, for any non-trivial subfunctor $F$ of the identity functor on the category of groups, any group can be embedded into a simple group that lies in the essential image of $F.$ The paper concludes with a few questions regarding the non-existence of certain (co-)augmented functors in the $\infty$-category of spaces.</description>

      <title>Fans and polytopes in tilting theory I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite dimensional algebra $A$ over a field $k$, the 2-term silting complexes of $A$ gives a simplicial complex $\Delta(A)$ called the $g$-simplicial complex. We give tilting theoretic interpretations of the $h$-vectors and Dehn-Sommerville equations of $\Delta(A)$. Using $g$-vectors of 2-term silting complexes, $\Delta(A)$ gives a nonsingular fan $\Sigma(A)$ in the real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-fan. We give several basic properties of $\Sigma(A)$ including sign-coherence, sign decomposition, idempotent reductions, Jasso reductions, pairwise positivity and a connection with Newton polytopes of $A$-modules. Moreover, $\Sigma(A)$ gives a (possibly infinite and non-convex) polytope $P(A)$ in $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$ called the $g$-polytope of $A$. We call $A$ $g$-convex if $P(A)$ is convex. In this case, we show that it is a reflexive polytope, and that the dual polytope is given by the 2-term simple minded collections of $A$. There are precisely 7 convex $g$-polyogons up to isomorphism. We give a classification of algebras whose $g$-polytopes are smooth Fano.
  We study $g$-fans and $g$-polytopes of two important classes of algebras. We show that the $g$-fan of a classical or generalized preprojective algebra is given by the Coxeter fan. It is $g$-convex if and only if it is of type $A$ or $B$, and in this case, its $g$-polytope is the dual polytope of the short root polytope. Moreover we classify Brauer graph algebras which are $g$-convex, and describe their $g$-polytopes as the root polytopes of type $A$ or $C$.</description>

      <title>The category $\Theta_2$, derived modifications, and deformation theory of monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A complex $C^\bullet(C,D)(F,G)(\eta, \theta)$, generalising the Davydov-Yetter complex of a monoidal category, is constructed. Here $C,D$ are $\Bbbk$-linear (dg) monoidal categories, $F,G\colon C\to D$ are $\Bbbk$-linear (dg) strict monoidal functors, $\eta,\theta\colon F\Rightarrow G$ are monoidal natural transformations. Morally, it is a complex of ``derived modifications'' $\eta \Rrightarrow \theta$, likewise for the case of dg categories one has the complex of ``derived natural transformations'' $F\Rightarrow G$, given by the Hochschild cochain complex of $C$ with coefficients in $C$-bimodule $D(F-,G=)$. As well, an intrinsic homological algebra interpretation of $C^\bullet(C,D)(F,G)(\eta,\theta)$ as $RHom$ in an abelian category of 2-bimodules over $C$, is provided.
  The complex $C^\bullet(C,D)(F,G)(\eta,\theta)$ naturally arises from a 2-cocellular dg vector space $A(C,D)(F,G)(\eta,\theta)\colon \Theta_2\to C^\bullet(\Bbbk)$, as its $\Theta_2$-totalization (here $\Theta_2$ is the category dual to the category of Joyal 2-disks).
  It is shown that $H^3(C^\bullet(C,C)(\mathrm{Id},\mathrm{Id})(\mathrm{id},\mathrm{id})))$ is isomorphic to the vector space of the outer infinitesimal deformations of the $\Bbbk$-linear monoidal category which we call {\it full} deformations. It means that the following data is to be deformed: (a) the underlying dg category structure, (b) the monoidal product on morphisms (the monoidal product on objects is a set-theoretical datum and is maintained under the deformation), (c) the associator. It is shown that $C^\bullet(C,D)(F,F)(\mathrm{id},\mathrm{id})$ is a homotopy $e_2$-algebra. Conjecturally, $C^\bullet(C,C)(\mathrm{Id},\mathrm{Id})(\mathrm{id},\mathrm{id})$ is a homotopy $e_3$-algebra; however the proof requires more sophisticated methods and we hope to complete it in our next paper.</description>
