      <title>Berry Trashcan With Short Range Attraction:Exact $p_x+i p_y$ Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the presence of analytic $p_x + i p_y$ superconducting ground states in the Berry Trashcan -- a minimal model of rhombohedral graphene valid for $n \ge 4$ layers -- under short-range attractive interactions. We demonstrate that the model, whose dispersion consists of a flat bottom surrounded by steep walls of prohibitive kinetic energy, serves as a building block to understand superconductivity in the moir\'e-free limit. We find that the ground-state chirality has a ``ferromagnetic'' coupling to that of the uniform Berry curvature of the model, and compare the analytically obtained binding energies, excitation spectra and off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) with numerical exact diagonalization results. We show that the analytic structure of this model is that of a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA), initially developed for quantum scars, and build a variety of other exact (but contrived) models with exact chiral superconductivity based on a method developed in Ref.[1]. However, under short range attraction, we show that the Berry Trashcan is the optimal and only realistic point in the class of GMP-like algebras to host a chiral superconductor state. A toy model in 1D and its related physics is also investigated. Our results reveal that chiral superconductivity is natural under attractive interactions in the Berry trashcan model of rhombohedral graphene in displacement field, although we make no claim about the origin of the attraction.</description>

      <title>The physics of superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we summarize the theoretical foundations underlying a variety of phenomena in superconductor-ferromagnet (SF) hybrid structures, with a focus on recent advances in several key areas. These include: (i) the fundamental understanding of proximity effects in SF-based systems; (ii) spin-valve effects in SF and SFS Josephson junctions; and (iii) the design and realization of superconducting memory elements, particularly in SIsF-type Josephson junctions. We also discuss the experimental progress in fabricating and characterizing spin-valve structures. Our discussion is restricted to junctions incorporating weak, homogeneous metallic ferromagnets with collinear magnetization directions, where the essential physical mechanisms can be analyzed within a relatively tractable theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Dome in Ionic Liquid Gated Homoepitaxial Strontium Titanate Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we patterned a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on the surface of a SrTiO$_3$ thin film grown homoepitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE). We explored the superconducting dome in this material system by tuning electron density with ionic liquid gating. We found superconducting transitions up to 503 mK near an optimal electron density of approximately 3 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This is a meaningful increase from the typical optimal transition near 350 mK in similar 2DEGs on SrTiO$_3$ single crystal substrate surfaces. Systematic tuning of 2DEG electron density revealed a consistent BCS scaling between superconducting critical temperature, coherence length, and electron mean free path. Substantial variation of transition width across the dome was described by a paraconductivity model combining Aslamazov-Larkin and Maki-Thompson contributions.</description>

      <title>THz electrodynamics and superconducting energy scales of ZrN thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) properties of ZrN thin films grown with CMOS-techniques on industry-standard 300 mm silicon wafers are investigated in order to explore their superconducting behavior. The films have thicknesses ranging from 18 to 48 nm, and their critical temperatures Tc are between 5 and 7.3 K. We probe the real and imaginary parts of the complex dynamical conductivity sigma in the frequency range from 100 - 540 GHz (0.4 - 2.2 meV) and as a function of temperature. The experiments provide direct access to the low-energy electrodynamics and key materials parameters such as superconducting energy gap and superfluid density. Our findings indicate that ZrN is a weakly coupled BCS-type superconductor with a gap-to-Tc ratio of approximately 3.4 in the thick film limit. For thinner films, this coupling ratio increases up to 4.0, departing from the BCS prediction. The results establish large-scale ZrN thin films as promising material for high-frequency superconducting applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic-correlation-assisted charge stripe order in a Kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central mystery in high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the coexistence of multiple exotic orders, which is presumably associated with strong electronic correlation. The ongoing interest in this enigmatic phenomenon is further energized when similar electronic orders and states emerge and coexist in less correlated Kagome superconductors. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and first-principles calculations, we reveal the sudden emergence of a distinct short-range charge stripe order in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome superconductors when the long-range $2 \times 2$ charge density wave order in pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is suppressed. This short-range stripe order features a modulation vector of approximately 1/3 along one of the three lattice directions, induces remarkable quasiparticle scattering between the original quasi-1D Kagome-d-bands and their replica of folding, and clearly suppresses the electron density of states at the Fermi level. Our first-principles calculations reveal that $3 \times 1$ supermodulation represents a hidden secondary instability in pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This instability is further enhanced by in-plane chemical pressure induced by Sn substitution, and coupled to the electronic correlation, leading to a unique charge stripe order in the system. As such, our results reveal a new route toward emergent electronic orders via cooperative interactions between the lattice and electronic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Same-group element replacement enhances superconductivity in clathrate-like YH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H3S, LaH10, and hydrogen-based compounds have garnered significant interest due to their high-temperature superconducting properties. However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of Yttrium (Y) by Scandium (Sc), Lanthanum (La), and Zirconium (Zr). Pure YH4, stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature (Tc) of 84-95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases Tc to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed Tc of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y-H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron-phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance Tc in hydride superconductors.</description>

      <title>Coherent oscillations in weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functionalization of quantum devices to increase their performance and extend their fields of application is an extremely active research area. One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality effect on exceptional fermionic superfluidity with spin-dependent asymmetric hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems host exceptional points (EPs), where eigenstates and eigenvalues coalesce, leading to unconventional many-body phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. While NH fermionic systems with complex interactions exhibit superfluid (SF) breakdown with EPs, spin-dependent asymmetric hopping can stabilize a NH superfluid (NH-SF) that coexists with EPs. In this work, we investigate the quasi-one-dimensional NH attractive Fermi-Hubbard model by using NH BCS theory. We demonstrate that, when the system is regarded as weakly-coupled chains, the exceptional SF phase becomes unstable and metastable (exceptional) SF state appears between the stable SF and normal states. In the one-dimensional limit, the exceptional SF disappear entirely and EPs only appear on the phase boundary between the normal and SF states. These results reveal how dimensional crossover governs the stability of the exceptional SF, providing the insights into the interplay between dimensionality and dissipation, with potential relevance for experimental implications in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux controlled current phase relationship in double Quantum Dot Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian. By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and finally into a triplet state at $\phi = \pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases. Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\Gamma$ exceeds the SC pairing potential $\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when $\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge, resulting in a triple point in the ($\phi$, $\phi_B$) parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in materials and fabrication of superconducting devices allows the exploration of novel quantum effects in synthetic superconducting systems beyond conventional Josephson junction arrays. As an example, we introduce a new circuit element, the Y-splitter, a superconducting loop with three leads and three Josephson junctions, smaller or comparable in size to the superconducting coherence length of the material. By tuning magnetic flux through an array of Y-splitters, Cooper-pair transport can be made to interfere destructively, while spatially separated split Cooper pairs propagate coherently. We consider an array of Y-splitters connected in a two-dimensional star [Archimedean (3,$12^2$)] geometry, deformable into the kagome lattice, and find a rich phase diagram that includes topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers $\pm 2$. Experimental realization appears feasible.</description>

      <title>Opposite-Mirror-Parity Scattering as the Origin of Superconductivity in Strained Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure and doping-dependent instabilities of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films using first-principles and functional renormalization group methods. We demonstrate that ordering tendencies are governed by Fermi surface scattering between electrons of opposite mirror parity. Under moderate hole doping, when the $d_{z^2}$ bonding band becomes incipient or crosses the Fermi level, robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity emerges from cooperative interlayer pairing reinforced by two competing spin-density-wave fluctuations. Compressive strain favors superconductivity in NiO$_2$ bilayers slightly away from the interface, whereas tensile strain induces pair-breaking nesting that suppresses pairing. Our results establish a unified microscopic scenario for superconductivity in pressurized bulk and strained thin-film nickelates, providing new insights into high-T$_c$ pairing in correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy to image vortices in superconducting strips fabricated from NbTiN thin films. We repeatedly cool superconducting strips with different width in an applied magnetic field and image the individual vortices. From these images we determine the threshold field at which the first vortex enters a strip, as well as the number and spatial configuration of vortices beyond this threshold field. We model vortex behavior with and without considering the effect of pinning by numercially minimizing the Gibbs free energy of vortices in the strips. Our measurements provide a first benchmark to understand the flux trapping properties of NbTiN thin films directly relevant to NbTiN-based superconducting circuits and devices.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics using a superconducting flux qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05336v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission, while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</description>

      <title>calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field and Temperature Limits of a Kinetic-Inductance Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials, KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the search for axion dark matter.</description>
