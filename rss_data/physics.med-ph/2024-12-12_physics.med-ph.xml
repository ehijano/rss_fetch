      <title>High-speed scattering polarimetry for correlative nerve fiber imaging and multi-modal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-Dimensional Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) and Computational Scattered Light Imaging (ComSLI) map dense nerve fibers in brain sections with micrometer resolution using visible light. 3D-PLI reconstructs single fiber orientations, while ComSLI captures multiple directions per pixel, offering deep insights into brain tissue structure. Here, we introduce the Scattering Polarimeter, a high-speed correlative microscope to leverage the strengths of both methods. Based on a M\"uller polarimeter, it incorporates variable retarders and a large-area light source for direct and oblique illumination, enabling rapid 3D-PLI and ComSLI measurements as well as measuring the M\"uller matrix per pixel. Applied to human and vervet monkey brain sections, the Scattering Polarimeter generates results comparable to state-of-the-art 3D-PLI and ComSLI setups and creates a multi-modal fiber direction map, integrating the robust fiber orientations obtained from 3D-PLI with fiber crossings from ComSLI. Furthermore, we discuss applications of the Scattering Polarimeter for unprecedented correlative and multi-modal brain imaging.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Based Mir Spectroscopy for Blood Glucose Estimation Using Pca-Driven Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we presented two innovative methods, which are Threshold-Based Derivative (TBD) and Adaptive Derivative Peak Detection(ADPD), that enhance the accuracy of Learning models for blood glucose estimation using Mid-Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. In these presented methods, we have enhanced the model's accuracy by integrating absorbance data and its differentiation with critical points. Blood samples were characterized with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and advanced preprocessing steps. The learning models were Ridge Regression and Support Vector Regression(SVR) using Leave-One-out Cross-Validation. Results exhibited that TBD and ADPD significantly outperform basic used methods. For SVR, the TBD increased the r2 score by around 27%, and ADPD increased it by around 10%. these Ridge Regression values were between 36% and 24%. In addition, Results demonstrate that TBD and ADPD significantly outperform conventional methods, achieving lower error rates and improved clinical accuracy, validated through Clarke and Parkes Error Grid Analysis.</description>

      <title>Fast high-resolution metabolite mapping in the rat brain using 1H-FID-MRSI at 14.1T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) enables the simultaneous non-invasive acquisition of MR spectra from multiple spatial locations inside the brain. While 1H-MRSI is increasingly used in the human brain, it is not yet widely applied in the preclinical settings, mostly because of difficulties specifically related to very small nominal voxel size in the rodent brain and low concentration of brain metabolites, resulting in low signal-to-noise ratio SNR.
  In this context, we implemented a free induction decay 1H-MRSI sequence (1H-FID-MRSI) in the rat brain at 14.1T. We combined the advantages of 1H-FID-MRSI with the ultra-high magnetic field to achieve higher SNR, coverage and spatial resolution in the rodent brain, and developed a custom dedicated processing pipeline with a graphical user interface: MRS4Brain toolbox.
  LCModel fit, using the simulated metabolite basis-set and in-vivo measured MM, provided reliable fits for the data at acquisition delays of 1.3 and 0.94 ms. The resulting Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds were sufficiently low (&lt;30%) for eight metabolites of interest, leading to highly reproducible metabolic maps. Similar spectral quality and metabolic maps were obtained between 1 and 2 averages, with slightly better contrast and brain coverage due to increased SNR in the latter case. Furthermore, the obtained metabolic maps were accurate enough to confirm the previously known brain regional distribution of some metabolites. The acquisitions proved high reproducibility over time.
  We demonstrated that the increased SNR and spectral resolution at 14.1T can be translated into high spatial resolution in 1H-FID-MRSI of the rat brain in 13 minutes, using the sequence and processing pipeline described herein. High-resolution 1H-FID-MRSI at 14.1T provided reproducible and high-quality metabolic mapping of brain metabolites with significantly reduced technical limitations.</description>

      <title>Correlation-weighted 23Na magnetic resonance fingerprinting in the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a new sodium magnetic resonance fingerprinting ($^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF) method for the simultaneous mapping of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$ and sodium density with built-in $\Delta\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ (radiofrequency transmission inhomogeneities) and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ corrections (frequency offsets). We based our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF implementation on a 3D FLORET sequence with 23 radiofrequency pulses. To capture the complex spin ${\frac{\text{3}}{\text{2}}}$ dynamics of the $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ nucleus, the fingerprint dictionary was simulated using the irreducible spherical tensor operators formalism. The dictionary contained 831,512 entries covering a wide range of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$, $\Delta\text{B}_\text{1}^{+}$ factor and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ parameters. Fingerprint matching was performed using the Pearson correlation and the resulting relaxation maps were weighted with a subset of the highest correlation coefficients corresponding to signal matches for each voxel. Our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF method was compared against reference methods in a 7-compartment phantom, and applied in brain in five healthy volunteers at 7 T. In phantoms, $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF produced values comparable to those obtained with reference methods. Average sodium relaxation time values in cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter across five healthy volunteers were in good agreement with values previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Direct Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction on GPU using Out-Of-Core: Precision and Quality Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic methods applied to the reconstruction of Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) can provide both a high image quality and a decrease in the dose received by patients, although with an increased reconstruction time since their computational costs are higher. In our work, we present a new algebraic implementation that obtains an exact solution to the system of linear equations that models the problem and based on single-precision floating-point arithmetic. By applying Out-Of-Core (OOC) techniques, the dimensions of the system can be increased regardless of the main memory size and as long as there is enough secondary storage (disk). These techniques have allowed to process images of 768 x 768 pixels. A comparative study of our method on a GPU using both single-precision and double-precision arithmetic has been carried out. The goal is to assess the single-precision arithmetic implementation both in terms of time improvement and quality of the reconstructed images to determine if it is sufficient to consider it a viable option. Results using single-precision arithmetic approximately halves the reconstruction time of the double-precision implementation, whereas the obtained images retain all internal structures despite having higher noise levels.</description>
