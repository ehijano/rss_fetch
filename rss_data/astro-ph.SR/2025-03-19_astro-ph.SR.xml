      <title>Minifilament Eruptions as the Last Straw to Break the Equilibrium of a Giant Solar Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filament eruptions are magnetically driven violent explosions commonly observed on the Sun and late-type stars, sometimes leading to monster coronal mass ejections that directly affect the nearby planets' environments. More than a century of research on solar filaments suggests that the slow evolution of photospheric magnetic fields plays a decisive role in initiating filament eruptions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using high-resolution observations from the \textit{Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer}, the \textit{Solar Upper Transition Region Imager}, and the \textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we present direct evidence that a giant solar filament eruption is triggered by a series of minifilament eruptions occurring beneath it. These minifilaments, which are homologous to the giant filament but on a smaller tempo-spatial scale, sequently form and erupt due to extremely weak mutual flux disappearance of opposite-polarity photospheric magnetic fields. Through multi-fold magnetic interactions, these erupting minifilaments act as the last straw to break the force balance of the overlying giant filament and initiate its ultimate eruption. The results unveil a possible novel pathway for small-scale magnetic activities near the stellar surface to initiate spectacular filament eruptions, and provide new insight into the magnetic coupling of filament eruptions across different tempo-spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Turbulent Flows Observed in Above the Loop-top Regions During Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flare above-the-loop-top (ALT) regions are vital for understanding solar eruptions and fundamental processes in plasma physics. Recent advances in 3D MHD simulations have revealed unprecedented details on turbulent flows and MHD instabilities in flare ALT regions. Here, for the first time, we examine the observable anisotropic properties of turbulent flows in ALT by applying a flow-tracking algorithm on narrow-band Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images that are observed from the face-on viewing perspective. First, the results quantitatively confirm the previous observation that vertical motions dominate and that the anisotropic flows are widely distributed in the entire ALT region with the contribution from both upflows and downflows. Second, the anisotropy shows height-dependent features, with the most substantial anisotropy appearing at a certain middle height in ALT, which agrees well with the MHD modeling results where turbulent flows are caused by Rayleigh-Taylor-type instabilities in the ALT region. Finally, our finding suggests that supra-arcade downflows (SADs), the most prominently visible dynamical structures in ALT regions, are only one aspect of turbulent flows. Among these turbulent flows, we also report the anti-sunward-moving underdense flows that might develop due to MHD instabilities, as suggested by previous three-dimensional flare models. Our results indicate that the entire flare fan displays group behavior of turbulent flows where the observational bright spikes and relatively dark SADs exhibit similar anisotropic characteristics.</description>

      <title>On Using Gradient Dynamic Spectra (GraDS) to Study Type-II Solar Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13876v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar type-II radio bursts are coherent plasma emissions arising from magnetohydrodynamic shocks produced by either coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or flares. Type-II bursts sometimes show split-band emissions in the dynamic spectrum. When these split-band emissions come from regions just upstream and downstream of the shock, type-II band-splitting can be used as an important tool for estimating magnetic fields at the shock front. Earlier studies have shown that only $\sim$20\% of the type-IIs show morphologically similar split-bands. Imaging studies can unambiguously identify such instances, though they remain very rare. Here we suggest a useful approach to augment dynamic spectra-based studies by also examining the Gradient Dynamic Spectra (GraDS) of type-II emission. We also verified the conclusions of this approach against those from an imaging study.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Youth: Decades of Mid-Infrared Variability and Color Evolution of Young Stellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is a crucial tool for understanding the mechanisms driving flux changes. In this study, we present an infrared variability analysis of a large sample of over 20,000 candidate YSOs, using data from the ALLWISE and NEOWISE surveys, which span around a decade with a 6-month cadence. We applied Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) analysis and linear fitting to the light curves, classifying them into distinct categories: {\it Secular} ({\it Linear}, {\it Curved}, and {\it Periodic}) and {\it Stochastic} ({\it Burst}, {\it Drop}, and {\it Irregular}). Our findings show that 5,467 (26.2$\pm$0.3\%) of the sources exhibit variability, with most (19.7$\pm$0.3\%) showing {\it Irregular} variations, followed by {\it Curved} and {\it Periodic} variations. In addition, 235 sources of {\it Bursts} and 122 {\it Drop} sources were identified. Variability is more pronounced in Class I sources with a higher fraction of variables (36.3$\pm$0.6\%) compared to Class II (22.1$\pm$0.4\%) and Class III (22.5$\pm$1.0\%) sources. The color (W1 $-$ W2) versus magnitude analysis (W2) using linear fitting shows that the trend ``redder-when-brighter" (RWB) is more prevalent (85.4$\pm$0.5\%) among YSOs. In contrast, the trend ``bluer-when-brighter" (BWB) is more common in younger sources compared to more evolved ones, having a BWB fraction of 29.0$\pm$1.1\% for Class I to 4.0$\pm$0.9\% for Class III.</description>

      <title>Comparison Between Cycle-to-Cycle Variations in the Coefficient of Joy's Law and Covariance of Rotation Residuals and Meridional Motions of Sunspot Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tilts of bipolar magnetic regions are believed to be caused by the action of Coriolis force on rising magnetic flux tubes. Here we analysed the combined Greenwich and Debrecen observatories sunspot-group data during the period
  1874-2017 and the tilt angles of sunspot groups measured at Mt. Wilson Observatory during the period 1917-1986 and Debrecen Observatory during the period 1994-2013. We find that there exists about 8-solar cycle (Gleissberg cycle) trend in the long-term variation of the slope of Joy's law (increase of tilt angle with latitude). There exists a reasonably significant correlation between the slope/coefficient of Joy's law and the slope (namely, residual covariance) of the linear relationship between the rotation residuals and meridional motions of sunspot groups in the northern hemisphere and also in the southern hemisphere during Solar Cycles 16-21. We also find that there exists a good correlation between north--south difference (asymmetry) in the coefficient of Joy's law and that in the residual covariance. We consider the residual covariance represents tentatively the coefficient of angular momentum transport. These results suggest that there exists a relationship between the surface/subsurface poleward/equatorward angular momentum transport and the Joy's law. There is a suggestion of the strength of the Joy's law depends on the strength of the poleward angular momentum transport.</description>

      <title>Pulsation Properties of Blazhko and Non-Blazhko RRab Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of the properties of Blazhko and non-Blazhko RRab stars. We identified 1054 non-Blazhko and 785 Blazhko RRab stars in the photometric data observed by K2 mission, which, combined with those 37 stars observed in the original Kepler field, constituted our study sample. Using the Fourier Decomposition method, we calculated the pulsation parameters, including phase differences and amplitude ratios, for these RRab stars, revealing significant discrepancies in the pulsation parameters between Blazhko and non-Blazhko RRab stars. However, distinguishing between Blazhko and Non-Blazhko RRab stars based on Fourier parameters remains challenging due to the significant overlap in their distributions. By cross-matching our sample with the LRS of LAMOST DR12, we identified 147 Blazhko and 111 non-Blazhko RRab stars, which exhibit similar metallicity distributions. Furthermore, cross-matching with Gaia DR3 data yielded 766 Blazhko and 950 non-Blazhko RRab stars, showing differences in color indices but not in absolute magnitudes. Our findings suggested the Blazhko effect is linked to pulsation parameters and colors, rather than metallicities or absolute magnitude.</description>

      <title>A new method to retrieve the star formation history from white dwarf luminosity functions -- an application to the Gaia catalogue of nearby stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the state-of-the-art Gaia astrometry, the number of confirmed white dwarfs has reached a few hundred thousand. We have reached the era where small features in the white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) of the solar neighbourhood can be resolved. We demonstrate how to apply Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling on a set of pre-computed partial-WDLFs to derive the star formation history of their progenitor stellar populations. We compare the results against many well-accepted and established works using various types of stars, including white dwarfs, main sequence stars, sub-giants and the entire stellar population. We find convincing agreements among most of the methods, particularly at the intermediate age of 0.1-9 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal formation via the streaming instability in simulations of infall dominated young disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks naturally emerge during protostellar core-collapse. In their early evolutionary stages, infalling material dominates their dynamical evolution. In the context of planet formation, this means that the conditions in young disks are different from the typically considered disks where infall has subsided. High inward velocities are caused by the advection of accreted material which is deficient in angular momentum, rather than being set by viscous spreading, and accretion gives rise to strong velocity fluctuations. Therefore, we aim to investigate when it is possible for the first planetesimals to form and subsequent planet formation to commence. We analyze the disks obtained in numerical 3D nonideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations, which serve as a basis for 1D models representing the conditions during the Class 0/I evolutionary stages. We integrate the 1D models with an adapted version of the TwoPopPy code to investigate the formation of the first planetesimals via the streaming instability. In disks with temperatures such that the snow line is located at ~10 AU and where it is assumed that velocity fluctuations felt by the dust are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the gas, ${\sim}10^{-3}M_\odot$ of planetesimals may be formed already during the first 100 kyr after disk formation, implying the possible early formation of giant planet cores. The cold-finger effect at the snow line is the dominant driver of planetesimal formation, which occurs in episodes and utilizes solids supplied directly from the envelope, leaving the disk solid reservoir intact. However, if the cold-finger effect is suppressed, early planetesimal formation is limited to cold disks with efficient dust settling whose dust-to-gas ratio is initially enriched to $\epsilon_0\geq 0.03$.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the electric dipole moment of AlCl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the electric dipole moment of aluminum monochloride (AlCl) using a cryogenic buffer-gas beam source. Our measurements provide values for the dipole moments of the two lowest vibrational states of the $X^1\Sigma^+$ and the $A^1\Pi$ electronic states. We also show that spin-orbit coupling with an extended number of spin states is essential in the ab initio calculation to correctly describe both the dipole moment and the Te energy of AlCl. We further lay out the implications of these results for astrophysical models of stellar and planetary evolution that have used a substitute value for the dipole moment of AlCl until now.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbits around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-global monopole spacetime in a homogeneous magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of charged particles in the spacetime of a global monopole swallowed by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole in the presence of a external weak asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field. We carefully analyze and deduce the conditions to have such a magnetic field around this black hole and show that this is indeed possible in the small but nontrivial charge and monopole term limit. We obtain general equations of motion and analyze them for special cases of circular orbits, focusing on the inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) of this configuration. The richness of the parameters and complicated forms of the resulting equations of motion necessitate a numerical approach. Hence, we have presented our results with numerous graphs, which help to understand the evolution of ISCO as a function of the external test magnetic field and the monopole term depending on the parameters of the black hole, such as its electrical charge as well as the properties of the test particle such as its specific charge, angular momentum, and energy. We have also analyzed the effective potential that these fields generate and deduced results for the aforementioned values of external and internal parameters of spacetime.</description>

      <title>CoCCoA: Complex Chemistry in hot Cores with ALMA. The chemical evolution of acetone from ice to gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acetone (CH3COCH3) is one of the most abundant three-carbon oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (O-COMs) that have been detected in space. Recently, acetone ice has been reported as (tentatively) detected toward B1-c, which enables the gas-to-ice comparison of its abundances. The detection of acetone ice warrants a more systematic study of its gaseous abundances which is currently lacking. Therefore, we conducted systematic measurements of acetone gas in a dozen hot cores observed by the CoCCoA survey and investigate the chemical evolution from ice to gas of acetone in protostellar systems. We fit the ALMA spectra to determined the column density, excitation temperature, and line width of acetone, along with propanal (C2H5CHO), ketene (CH2CO), and propyne (CH3CCH), which might be chemically linked with acetone. We found that the observed gas abundances of acetone are surprisingly high compared to those of two-carbon O-COMs, while aldehydes are overall less abundant than other O-COMs (e.g., alcohols, ethers, and esters). This may suggest specific formation or destruction mechanisms that favor the production of ethers, esters, and ketones over aldehydes. The derived physical properties suggest that acetone, propanal, and ketene have the same origin from hot cores as other O-COMs, while propyne tends to trace the more extended outflows. The acetone-to-methanol ratios are higher in ice than in gas by one order of magnitude, hinting at gas-phase reprocessing after sublimation. There are several suggested formation pathways of acetone (in both ice and gas) from acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ketene, and propylene (C3H6). The observed ratios between acetone and the relevant species are rather constant across the sample, and can be well reproduced by astrochemical simulations, but more investigations are needed to draw solid conclusions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instability in protoplanetary disk with cooling: 2D global analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-gravity is important in protoplanetary disks for planet formation through gravitational instability (GI). We study the cooling effect on GI in a thin two-dimensional protoplanetary disk. By solving the linear perturbation equations in global geometry, we obtain all the normal modes. Faster cooling leads to faster growth rate of GI with lower azimuthal wavenumber $m$. According to the spatial structure of normal modes at different mass-averaged Toomre number $\overline{Q}$ and dimensionless cooling timescale $\beta$, we identify three modes: local, transitional and global. The transitional modes are located in the outer disk while the other two modes in the inner disk. At $\beta\approx 1$ (the resonance of dynamical timescale and thermal timescale) the growth rate changes sharply and the transitional modes dominate. The disk $\alpha$ due to GI is much higher in the transitional modes than in the other two. Our result implies that the transitional modes at $\overline{Q}\approx 1$ and $\beta\approx 1$ can plausibly interpret the substructures and planet/brown dwarf formation in the outer disk.</description>

      <title>Propagation Times and Energy Losses of Cosmic Protons and Antiprotons in Interplanetary Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14025v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the heliospheric modulation of cosmic rays in interplanetary space, focusing on their propagation times and energy losses over the solar cycle. To perform the calculations, we employed a data-driven model based on the stochastic method. Our model was calibrated using time-resolved and energy-resolved data from several missions including AMS-02, PAMELA, EPHIN/SOHO, BESS, and data from Voyager-1. This approach allows us to calculate probability density functions for the propagation time and energy losses of cosmic protons and antiprotons in the heliosphere. Furthermore, we explore the temporal evolution of these probabilities spanning from 1993 to 2018, covering a full 22-year cycle of magnetic polarity, which includes two solar minima and two magnetic reversals. Our calculations were carried out for cosmic protons and antiprotons, enabling us to investigate the role of charge-sign dependent effects in cosmic ray transport. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical processes of cosmic-ray propagation in the heliosphere and contribute to a deeper understanding of the solar modulation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Delayed Thermal Relaxation of Rapidly Cooling Neutron Stars: Neucleon Superfluidity and Non-nucleon Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal relaxation time of neutron stars, typically defined by a sudden drop in surface temperature, is usually on the order of 10 to 100 years. In this study, we investigate neutron star thermal relaxation by incorporating nucleon superfluidity and non-nucleonic particles, specifically considering hyperons as a representative case. We find that rapidly cooling neutron stars driven by neutron superfluidity and direct Urca processes demonstrate delayed thermal relaxation under specific physical conditions. The former acquires that the neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature is small enough, whereas the latter depends on the presence of a small core that permits direct Urca processes. To explore these scenarios, we propose simple theoretical frameworks to describe these delayed thermal relaxation behaviors and discuss how an recently-established enhanced modified Urca rate influences the relaxation time. By confronting the theoretical results with the observation of Cassiopeia A, we can effectively constrain the maximum neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Astrometry and Precise Radial Velocities Yield a Complete Orbital Solution for the Nearby Eccentric Brown Dwarf LHS 1610 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHS 1610 system consists of a nearby ($d=9.7$ pc) M5 dwarf hosting a candidate brown dwarf companion in a $10.6$ day, eccentric ($e \sim 0.37$) orbit. We confirm this brown dwarf designation and estimate its mass ($ 49.5_{-3.5}^{+4.3}$ $M_{\text{Jup}} $) and inclination ($ 114.5^\circ$ $_{-10.0}^{+7.4}$) by combining discovery radial velocities (RVs) from TRES and new RVs from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder with the available Gaia astrometric two-body solution. We highlight a discrepancy between the measurement of the eccentricity from the Gaia two-body solution ($e=0.52 \pm 0.03$) and the RV-only solution ($e=0.3702\pm0.0003$). We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, which can be further probed when the Gaia astrometric time series becomes available as part of Gaia DR4. As a nearby mid-M star hosting a massive short-period companion with a well-characterized orbit, LHS 1610 b is a promising target to look for evidence of sub-Alfv\'enic interactions and/or auroral emission at optical and radio wavelengths. LHS 1610 has a flare rate ($0.28\pm 0.07$ flares/day) on the higher-end for its rotation period ($84 \pm 8$ days), similar to other mid-M dwarf systems such as Proxima Cen and YZ Ceti that have recent radio detections compatible with star-planet interactions. While available TESS photometry is insufficient to determine an orbital phase-dependence of the flares, our complete orbital characterization of this system makes it attractive to probe star-companion interactions with additional photometric and radio observations.</description>

      <title>Eccentricities of Close Stellar Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. These eccentricities encode information about their early lives. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the Gaia DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode sigma_e ~ 0.3. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to a thousand days (possibly extending to tens of AU). This observed distribution is most likely primordial and its invariance suggests a single universal process. One possibility is eccentricity excitation by circumbinary disks. Another, as is suggested by the Rayleigh form, is weak scattering and ejection of brown-dwarf objects. We explore this latter scenario and find that the binary eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of sigma_e ~ sqrt{M_bd M_*}. So to explain the observed mode, the brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of both proposals remains to be tested.</description>

      <title>Novel SiC UV Instrumentation Development with Potential Applications for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.</description>
