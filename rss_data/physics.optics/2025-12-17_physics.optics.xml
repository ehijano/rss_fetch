      <title>First-return statistics in bounded radiative transport: A Motzkin polynomial framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A photon entering a scattering medium executes a three-dimensional random walk determined by the Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The photon either reaches the boundary for a first passage or is absorbed. Projecting the walk onto the axial direction produces a one-dimensional alternating process whose peaks and valleys correspond to changes in the sign of the projected step. This reduction preserves first-return and first-passage events and leads to a representation in terms of Motzkin-type polynomials. The analytical formulation is complete except for boundary-constrained return terms, which appear as high-order integrals. We treat these contributions with a single truncation factor determined from Monte Carlo simulations of first-return distributions over a wide range of anisotropy g and scattering steps ms. The resulting factor follows a Cauchy distribution. Incorporating it yields first-return probabilities in agreement with full three-dimensional Monte Carlo to within 2% for g&lt;=0.7. The approach gives backscattering coefficients from phase-function integrals and provides an efficient alternative to full three-dimensional simulations for problems of radiative transport in semi-infinite media.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained microcomb lasing in an integrated hybrid oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcavity optical frequency combs (microcombs) are compact, coherent light sources whose chip-scale integrability is poised to drive advances in metrology, communications, and sensing. Among available microcomb generation methods, hybrid cavities uniquely co-locate gain and Kerr dynamics, where the lasing mode directly resonates in the nonlinear microcavity, simultaneously enabling self-sustained and highly efficient microcomb generation. However, their implementation is often limited by partial integration or the need for external injection, which complicates operation architecture, raises power and hampers system miniaturization. In this work, we present a fully integrated hybrid cavity for self-sustained microcomb generation, relying solely on the co-oscillation of lasing and Kerr nonlinearity without external driving. The system collapses the pump laser, nonlinear resonator and feedback loops into a minimalist on-chip two-element cavity, consisting of a high-Q microresonator with engineered intracavity reflection and a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA). The scheme delivers self-starting operation and stable performance without active feedback. The generated coherent microcomb achieves intrinsic linewidths below 1 kHz and integrated linewidths around 100 kHz, with self-sustained operation exceeding 24 hours. This ultra-compact architecture provides a practical path toward scalable, coherent multi-wavelength sources for integrated photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Nonlocality and Optical Nonlinearity of Transdimensional Titanium Nitride in the Epsilon-Near-Zero Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14035v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin plasmonic films that approach the trans-dimensional (TD) thickness limit provide a promising route for light_matter interaction control and manipulation, yet their nonlinear optical response near the epsilon_near_zero (ENZ) condition remains poorly understood. Here, we report the strongly enhanced optical nonlinearity for their typical representative high quality TiN epitaxial films with thicknesses down to a few nanometers. Systematic Z_scan measurements reveal a pronounced increase in nonlinear absorption with decreasing thickness. Especially in the ENZ spectral region, the TD TiN films exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude stronger nonlinear absorption over a broad range of incidence angles as compared to conventional thin films. The enhanced nonlinear absorption observed is well described by a nonlinear nonlocal electromagnetic response model that accounts for electron confinement effects unique to the TD plasmonic systems. Comparison with Ti1_xAlxN highlights the necessity of low-loss ENZ response for nonlinear enhancement. These findings identify TiN and similar TD plasmonic systems as a robust refractory platform for exploiting ENZ mediated nonlinear processes in ultrathin photonic material structures.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to Bifurcations in Kerr Ring and Fabry-Perot Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality Kerr resonators are a key platform for studying nonlinear optical phenomena, where bifurcations such as optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking are both of theoretical and practical significance. In this work, we present an analytical framework, which allows finding the stationary states and their bifurcations for the propagating fields in Kerr ring and Fabry-Perot resonators. Using tools from nonlinear algebra, namely, polynomial resultants and Groebner bases, we derive compact polynomial expressions describing the system full solution in both intensity and amplitude representations. The bifurcations are derived from these expressions, and are additionally characterized as exceptional points of an auxiliary linear non-Hermitian system. This work unifies key phenomena in Kerr resonators under the broader framework of nonlinear algebra and offers better control of nonlinear optical systems and the design of photonic devices, enabled by full analytic control.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Ellipsometry for Two-Dimensional Materials: Methods, Optical Modeling, and Emerging Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) has emerged as a powerful and non-destructive optical characterization technique for probing the complex dielectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ellipsometric methods applied to atomically thin and multilayer van der Waals materials, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and other emerging 2D systems. We discuss experimental configurations, optical modeling strategies, and challenges associated with reduced dimensionality, anisotropy, and substrate effects. Advanced techniques such as Mueller matrix ellipsometry are highlighted for their capability to resolve in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric tensor components in anisotropic and low-symmetry materials. Furthermore, we review recent discoveries enabled by ellipsometry, including extreme optical anisotropy, hyperbolic dispersion, and tunable plasmonic responses in multilayer 2D materials. These findings establish spectroscopic ellipsometry as an essential tool for both fundamental studies and photonic device engineering based on two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Decoding Orbital Angular Momentum in Turbid Tissue-like Scattering Medium via Fourier-Domain Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), such as Laguerre-Gaussian modes, are promising tools for high-capacity optical communications and advanced biomedical imaging. However, multiple scattering in turbid media distorts their phase and amplitude, complicating the retrieval of topological charge. We introduce VortexNet, a deep learning architecture that integrates an Angular Fourier Transform to explicitly extract rotational symmetries of OAM beams from experimentally acquired intensity and interference patterns. By transforming spatial information into the angular frequency domain, VortexNet isolates azimuthal features that persist despite scattering, enabling accurate topological charge classification even in complex optical environments. The results reveal that OAM-specific angular correlations can survive multiple scattering and be decoded through angular-domain learning. This establishes a new paradigm for structured-light analysis in complex medium, where deep learning enables the recovery of topological information beyond the reach of classical optics, paving the way for resilient photonic systems in communication, sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <title>In-plane optically tunable magnetic states in 2D materials via tailored femtosecond laser driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that light can control magnetism in matter, e.g. via the inverse Faraday effect or ultrafast demagnetization. However, such control is typically limited to magnetization transverse to light's polarization plane, or out-of-plane magnetism in 2D materials, while in-plane magnetic moments have remained largely unexplored. This is due to the difficulty of generating electronic orbital angular momentum components within light's polarization plane. Here we overcome this limitation, demonstrating complete three-dimensional, all-optical control of magnetism in 2D materials. Using first-principles simulations, we show that a tailored, two-color laser field can induce and steer magnetic moments in any direction with the relative angle between the laser polarizations playing a key parameter in coherent control. We analyze the physical mechanism of this process and show that it arises from a simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in the two-color laser. In-plane orbital moments are introduced via non-zero out-of-plane longitudinal photogalvanic currents enabled by broken inversion and mirror symmetries, while time-reversal symmetry breaking enables build-up of spin-rotation processes through spin-orbit coupling, translating the orbital moments to transient magnetism. Our findings demonstrate a full 3D coherent control scheme for transient magnetic states on femtosecond timescales driven by tailored lasers, and can be used to develop novel spectroscopies for magnetism, all-optical magnetic switching for ultrafast spintronics, and novel information storage capabilities.</description>

      <title>From Atomic Defects to Integrated Photonics: A Perspective on Solid-State Quantum Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) constitute a foundational resource for quantum technologies, including secure communication, photonic quantum computing, and emerging quantum network architectures. A wide range of quantum materials, from atom-like point defects in bulk crystals to excitonic states in low-dimensional semiconductors, now provide bright, coherent, and scalable sources of non-classical light. Meanwhile, advances in photonic integration have enabled efficient routing, filtering, and on-chip manipulation of these emitters. From this perspective, we survey and discuss the technological landscape in which solid-state emitters interface with quantum sensing, quantum communication, quantum computation, and emerging photonic AI platforms. Further, we discuss the materials landscape underpinning modern single-photon sources from the zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials. Lastly, we highlight key integration pathways for these single-photon emitters into scalable quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Free-Running Ring Quantum Cascade Laser with 50 kHz Linewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the noise characterization of a free-running ring quantum cascade laser resonator emitting a single frequency mode around 7.7 $\mu$m. Using a gas cell filled with N$_2$O as a frequency-to-voltage discriminator, we measured the frequency noise power spectral density of the laser from which we extracted its linewidth. The results show a full width at half maximum close to 50 kHz at 1 s integration time, which represents at least a sixfold improvement compared to state-of-the-art quantum cascade lasers operating in a spectral region above 7 $\mu$m. We also demonstrate that such lasers can be efficiently used for frequency modulation spectroscopy, which opens up new possibilities for high resolution metrology and spectroscopic applications in the mid-infrared.</description>

      <title>Polarization- and wave-vector selective optical metasurface with near-field coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are a powerful tool for manipulating light using small structures on the nanoscale. In most meta-surfaces, near-field couplings are treated as unfavorable perturbations. Here, we experimentally investigate a structure consisting of sinusoidally modulated silicon waveguides where near-field coupling of local resonances leads to negative coupling, i.e. a negative coupling constant. This gives rise to wave-vector dependent eigenstates of elliptical, linear and circular polarizations. In particular, fully circular polarization states are not only present at a single point in momentum-space (k-space), but along a line. This circular polarization line, as well as a linear polarization line, emanates from a polarization degeneracy at the Dirac point. We experimentally validate the existence of these eigenstates and demonstrate the energy-, polarization- and wave-vector-dependence of this metasurface. By tuning the incident k-vector, certain polarization-energy eigenstates are strongly reflected allowing for uses in angle-tunable polarization filters and light sources.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Plasmonic Nanocavity Arrays Forming Metasurfaces to Boost Second Harmonic Generation due to Surface Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic metasurfaces have emerged as a promising platform for enhancing a range of nonlinear optical processes, offering compact geometry and flexibility in light manipulation. Second order nonlinear processes, like second harmonic generation (SHG), typically require non-centrosymmetric crystals to be realized. Here, we experimentally demonstrate enhanced SHG response by using a gold nanocavity array forming a plasmonic metasurface absorber where titanium dioxide (TiO2), a centrosymmetric dielectric material, with subwavelength thickness is deposited in the realized nanogaps. While such dielectric material has an extremely low second order nonlinear susceptibility, we observe 105-fold boosting in the nonlinear SHG process mainly due to the surface nonlinear susceptibility of the gold metal aided by the significant electric field enhancement that occurs in the nanogaps due to the formed nanocavity resonance. The experimental results obtained are theoretically explained with extensive and rigorous nonlinear simulations that consider all the bulk and surface linear and nonlinear material properties. The presented robust harmonic generation from an ultrathin plasmonic metasurface can be used in nonlinear and quantum integrated photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels in the Three-Backlink Experiment for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current planned space-based gravitational-wave detectors require a bidirectional optical connection, referred to as Backlink, between two adjacent optical benches to provide a mutual phase reference for the local interferometric measurements. However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\text{ pm}\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions. We show that all three Backlinks reach sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels across most of the frequency band, with the remaining part dominated by the mentioned testbed noise. This enabled us to conduct a preliminary study of the Backlink inherent noise, where we emphasized on the backscatter noise intrinsic to a straightforward fiber-based Backlink, as this is the current baseline for LISA.</description>

      <title>Construction techniques and commissioning of the Three-Backlink Experiment for the LISA mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designed to detect gravitational waves in the lower-frequency band, the space mission LISA will open a new window to astronomy after its launch in the 2030s. Each LISA spacecraft houses two optical benches that require the exchange of a phase reference between them via an optical connection, called a Backlink. Here we present the construction and commissioning of an ultra-stable quasi-monolithic optical testbed to investigate different Backlink implementations: a direct fiber, a frequency-separated fiber, and a free-beam link, compared in the Three-Backlink Experiment. Dedicated alignment techniques crucial for the construction of these optical benches are presented together with the development of a high-precision beam alignment and measurement tool - a Calibrated Quadrant Photodiode Singleton. An upper limit for the performance of all three investigated Backlink schemes, as determined by initial experiments, can be set at a $15\text{pm}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$-equivalent level within the LISA band, spanning 0.1mHz to 1Hz. Our measurements were able to verify the successful construction and commissioning of this very complex interferometer as an interferometric laboratory testbed for LISA. We find no limitations due to the construction on the here reported performance levels. Our results can support the construction of high-precision metrology testbeds for space-based laser interferometry for future gravitational wave or geodesy missions.</description>

      <title>Blue-shifted dispersive waves and broadband UV emission using dual-core SiN waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that using strongly coupled dual-core waveguides for supercontinuum generation shifts the wavelength of the high-frequency dispersive waves towards shorter wavelengths, as compared to generation in a single-core waveguide having the same core dimensions. In a demonstration experiment, we launch ultrashort infrared pump pulses at 1-$\mu$m wavelength (285-THz frequency) into silicon nitride waveguides, where soliton formation and fission leads to generation of dispersive waves in the visible range. Efficient input coupling and controlled excitation of the fundamental supermodes of the dual-core waveguide is provided with adiabatic tapers and a dual-prong input structure. For the dual-core waveguide, the short-wavelength dispersive wave is located at 540~nm (green, 555~THz), which is blue-shifted by 80~nm (70~THz) compared to that of the single-core waveguide. Simultaneously, the dual-core waveguide generates broadband radiation spanning from the blue into the UV range, reaching to below 350~nm (above 855~THz), with typically a spectral density 25~dB below that of the dispersive wave. The broadband component can be addressed to third harmonic generation and is not observed in single-core supercontinuum generation. Numerical modeling shows good agreement with experimental measurements. The demonstrated dual-core approach and dedicated input coupling appear to hold promise also for other waveguide structures, independent of specific materials or core dimensions, by providing shorter wavelengths than with the respective single-core waveguide.</description>

      <title>Microwave control of photonic spin Hall effect in atomic system</title>

Abstract: The photonic Spin Hall Effect (SHE) causes a polarization-dependent transverse shift of light at an interface. There is a significant research interest in controlling and enhancing the photonic SHE. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the microwave field control of the photonic SHE in a closed-loop $\Lambda$-type atomic system. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $\phi$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $\Omega_{\mu}$. At zero probe field detuning ($\Delta_p = 0$) and $\phi=0,\pi$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $\Omega_{\mu}$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $\Omega_{\mu}$. At intermediate phases, especially at $\phi = \pi/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $\Omega_{\mu}$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $\phi$ at an optimized value of $\Omega_{\mu}$ and $\Omega_{c}$. In contrast, at $\Delta_p = \pm \Omega_c$, a maximum photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist occurs at $\phi \leq \pi$ and $\Omega_{\mu} \geq \Omega_p$, where both real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility vanish, yielding a unit refractive index. Our results may have potential applications in microwave quantum sensing and quantum optical switches based on the photonic SHE.</description>

      <title>Field localisation and spin-momentum locking in zero-dimensional dissipative topological photonic interface state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological photonic systems support edge states that are robust against disorder and perturbation. Depending on the symmetry and dimensionality of the bulk systems, different edge states emulating soliton, quantum integer and quantum spin Hall effects have been realized. A major concern in photonics is how one can shape the strength and polarisation of electromagnetic fields to suit different applications. Here, we show zero-dimensional (0D) interface state arising from one-dimensional (1D) dissipative topological photonic crystals exhibit strong field localisation and spin-momentum locking thanks to its complex classical analogue Dirac mass parameter. By using spatiotemporal coupled mode theory to formulate 1D photonic crystals and their corresponding Jackiw Rebbi-like (JR) interface state, we find the interaction between two energy bands at high symmetry points plays a major role in defining not only the topological triviality of the crystals but also its complex Dirac mass parameter. More importantly, when two topological trivial and nontrivial bulk systems are brought together to form a JR state, while the real part of the Dirac mass parameter governs the spectral and spatial field localisations of the interface state, the imaginary part gives rise to a net flow of energy towards the interface and a transverse spin angular momentum, resulting in a strong spin-momentum locking. We verify our theory by 1D plasmonic crystals using finite-difference time-domain simulations as well as far-field angle-resolved spectroscopy and imaging.</description>

      <title>Optical Downlink Modeling for LEO and MEO Satellites under Atmospheric Turbulence with a Quantum State Tomography Use Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the link budget for free-space optical systems involving Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. We develop a detailed model of the satellite-to-ground channel that accounts for the primary physical processes affecting transmittance: atmospheric absorption and scattering, free-space diffraction, and turbulence-induced fluctuations. The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case. We propose a scheme for quantum state tomography performed on states generated by an onboard photon source on an LEO or MEO satellite and transmitted to the optical ground station. This approach enables continuous verification of the quality of quantum resources that can be used to perform quantum protocols within quantum information networks.</description>

      <title>Achieving $10^{-5}$ level relative intensity crosstalk in optical holographic qubit addressing via a double-pass digital micromirror device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic beam shaping is a powerful approach for generating individually addressable optical spots for controlling atomic qubits, such as those in trapped-ion quantum processors. However, its application in qubit control is limited by residual intensity crosstalk at neighboring sites and by a nonzero background floor in the far wings of the addressing beam, leading to accumulated errors from many exposed qubits. Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\,\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit. These results provide a compact, DMD-based solution for low-crosstalk optical holographic qubit addressing that is directly applicable to trapped ions and other spatially ordered quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze theoretically THz response of an electron-hole pair confined in a semiconductor nanoparticle. We show that the interplay of particle confinement and electron-hole Coulomb interaction leads to significant renormalizations and energy shifts in THz linear conductivity of the nanocrystal. We develop and evaluate models in the strong and the weak confinement regime in order to correctly address the effect of Coulomb interaction. In the weak confinement regime, we find solutions of the problem in a form similar to the Wannier wavefunction whose spatial extent is reduced as a consequence of the confinement. The resulting states are scalable down to the strong confinement regime, enabling a theoretical description of the exciton response for arbitrarily sized nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Physically Grounded Monocular Depth via Nanophotonic Wavefront Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depth foundation models offer strong learned priors for 3D perception but lack physical depth cues, leading to ambiguities in metric scale. We introduce a birefringent metalens -- a planar nanophotonic lens composed of subwavelength pixels for wavefront shaping with a thickness of 700 nm and a diameter of 3 mm -- to physically prompt depth foundation models. In a single monocular shot, our metalens physically embeds depth information into two polarized optical wavefronts, which we decode through a lightweight prompting and fine-tuning framework that aligns depth foundation models with the optical signals. To scale the training data, we develop a light wave propagation simulator that synthesizes metalens responses from RGB-D datasets, incorporating key physical factors to minimize the sim-to-real gap. Simulated and physical experiments with our fabricated titanium-dioxide metalens demonstrate accurate and consistent metric depth over state-of-the-art monocular depth estimators. The research demonstrates that nanophotonic wavefront formation offers a promising bridge for grounding depth foundation models in physical depth sensing.</description>

      <title>Strongly coupled photonic molecules as doubly-coupled oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a field-theoretic model of strongly coupled photonic molecules composed of interacting dielectric cavities in a closed, perfect-electric-conductor domain. Within this setting, we treat the resulting inter-mode couplings non-perturbatively. We demonstrate the predictive power of this framework by showing that supermode eigenfrequencies, field profiles, and mode volumes can be obtained directly from the isolated-cavity modes and dielectric environment, without electromagnetic simulations of the composite structure or numerical fitting. While our model affirms the phenomenological approach of modeling coupled cavity modes as simple coordinate-coupled oscillators in the weak coupling regime, we show that this intuition remarkably breaks down for strong coupling. Instead, we demonstrate that strongly coupled cavity modes are analogous to harmonic oscillators we term as \emph{doubly} coupled, with interactions via electric and magnetic fields appearing as independent coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum couplings, respectively. We show that this distinction is not merely cosmetic, but gives rise to observable properties while providing deep insights into the physical mechanism behind previously observed phenomena, such as coupling induced frequency shifts. Finally, we illustrate that the complex interplay of these dual couplings suggests the possibility to realize exotic phenomena that typically only occur in the ultrastrong coupling regime, here predicted to emerge for comparably modest mode splittings within a regime we term pseudo-ultrastrong coupling.</description>

      <title>LensPlus: A High Space-bandwidth Optical Imaging Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space-bandwidth product (SBP) imposes a fundamental limitation in achieving high-resolution and large field-of-view image acquisitions simultaneously. High-NA objectives provide fine structural detail at the cost of reduced spatial coverage and slower scanning as compared to a low-NA objective, while low-NA objectives offer wide fields of view but compromised resolution. Here, we introduce LensPlus, a deep learning-based framework that enhances the SBP of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) without requiring hardware modifications. By training on paired datasets acquired with low-NA and high-NA objectives, LensPlus learns to recover high-frequency features lost in low-NA measurements, effectively bridging the resolution gap while preserving the large field of view thereby increasing the SBP. We demonstrate that LensPlus can transform images acquired with a 10x/0.3 NA objective (40x/0.95 NA for another model) to a quality comparable to that obtained using a 40x/0.95 NA objective (100x/1.45NA for the second model), resulting in a 2D-SBP improvement of approximately 3.5x (2.04x for the second model). Importantly, unlike adversarial models, LensPlus employs non-generative model to minimize image hallucinations and ensure quantitative fidelity as verified through spectral analysis. Beyond QPI, LensPlus is broadly applicable to other lens-based imaging modalities, enabling wide-field, high-resolution imaging for time-lapse studies, large-area tissue mapping, and applications where high-NA oil objectives are impractical.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation framework for modeling collective emission in ensembles of inhomogeneous solid-state emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient simulation framework is proposed to model collective emission in disordered ensembles of quantum emitters. Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly. Our approach generalizes to other types of emitters, including atoms, molecules, and quantum dots, thus providing a practical tool for analyzing collective behavior in realistic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Coupling Light with Matter for Identifying Dominant Subnetworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DOMINO, a light-matter computing platform that exploits the full complex amplitude of coupled condensate networks to solve maximum-weight clique problems and reveal hidden indirect correlations in large graphs. By embedding network structure directly into a gain-controlled polaritonic (or photonic) oscillator array, DOMINO performs analog optimization, directly solving the maximum-weight clique problem via the gain-controlled minimisation, through a physically enforced global-intensity constraint, allowing the system to converge rapidly to dominant subnetworks while simultaneously extracting phase, encoded co- and counter-regulation patterns. This gain-based mechanism unlocks capabilities inaccessible to conventional Ising-type simulators: all degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase) participate in the computation, dramatically expanding the class of problems that can be efficiently encoded. Our approach is inherently ultrafast, energy-efficient, and naturally robust to noise, requiring no digital post-processing. Applied to real gene-gene coexpression data, DOMINO reliably identifies biologically meaningful transcription-regulator modules and exposes latent regulatory relationships. Because the method applies generically to any weighted network, it establishes a scalable physical route to solving high-value graph-analytic tasks across biology, finance, social systems, and engineered networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system comprising two identical helical or planar undulators separated by a gap -- viz., an optical klystron (OK) -- is investigated. A formula for the frequency distribution of spontaneous radiation at zero angle is derived. It is shown that the spontaneous radiation line shape gradually narrows with increasing distance (up to an optimal value) between the undulators due to the constructive interference of the radiation fields formed in each of them, while the number of radiated photons decreases. The free-electron laser (FEL) gain coefficient also gradually increases, since it is proportional to the derivative of the spontaneous radiation line shape. Using the undulator parameters of the SASE XFEL and the bunch parameters of the LCLS, the total gain coefficient in the X-ray range is on the order of 2.5 and, for a different electron energy, reaches approximately 90 in the water window frequency range.</description>

      <title>Fast Interlayer Energy Transfer from the Lower Bandgap MoS2 to the Higher Bandgap WS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material, depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report an ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to the higher bandgap WS2, due to a near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct-to-indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evidenced by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. Our work shows at 300 K, the ET timescale of ~33 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K to K') time and competing with the ultrafast charge transfer timescale. Thus, allowing us to open a new direction in understanding the competing inter/intralayer processes.</description>

Abstract: The strong coupling between light and matter gives rise to polaritons. Further coupling polaritons to phonons leads to the formation of hybrid polaromechanical systems. Recent experiments have achieved the strong coupling between polaritons and phonons in two configurations, namely, the magnon-photon-phonon and exciton-photon-phonon systems, which enables the control of mechanical motion via manipulating polaritons. Here, we present a polaromechanical cooling theory and explicitly show how two polaritons can be used to simultaneously cool two mechanical modes. The unique advantage of our protocol lies in the fact that the continuous tunability of the polariton frequencies over a wide range allows for the cooling of any two mechanical modes with their frequency difference falling within this range. We further discuss how to extend the theory to cool multiple mechanical modes. The protocol is designed for cooling mechanical motion in various emerging polaromechanical platforms, such as magnon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaromechanical systems, which is the first step towards quantum states generation in these hybrid systems.</description>

Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.4E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Extracting the photon indistinguishability error from measurable quantum observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to extract the photon indistinguishability error from Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements, accounting for the combined effects of loss and multiphoton noise that contaminate the single-photon Hilbert space. Our analysis resolves apparent inconsistencies in previous interpretations of such measurements. The reported method applies to a wide range of single-photon sources, including quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Quantized plasmon modes for metallic nanoparticles of arbitrary shape with a generic dielectric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an effective approach to quantize the electromagnetic response of plasmonic metallic nanostructures. Their shape is arbitrary and they feature a realistic description of the frequency-dependent metal dielectric function that is based on experimental data. The derived quantum modes correctly reproduce the linear response macroscopic polarization of the nanoparticle upon external drive according to classical macroscopic Maxwell equations in the quasistatic limit. Such methodology paves the way for accurate modeling of plexcitonic system, where strong plasmon-molecule coupling and/or strong-driving fields call for a quantized description of the plasmonic response.</description>
