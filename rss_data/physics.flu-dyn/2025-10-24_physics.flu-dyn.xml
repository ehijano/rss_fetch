      <title>Guiding diffusion models to reconstruct flow fields from sparse data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.</description>

      <title>The increased drift of steep focusing surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irrotational and monochromatic surface gravity waves possess a mean Lagrangian drift which transports mass and enhances mixing in the upper ocean. In the ocean, where many surface waves are present, it is commonly assumed that the mean Lagrangian drift can be computed independently for each wave component and summed. Here we show, using laboratory measurements and fully nonlinear simulations of steep focusing wave packets, that this assumption underpredicts the average transport in regions of wave focusing by up to 30%. To explain these enhancements, we derive a new exact method for constraining the local mean Lagrangian drift in general flows by working in the Lagrangian reference frame. From this method, we derive a higher-order expression for the local mean Lagrangian drift in narrow-banded wave fields governed by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) that predicts near-surface enhancements when waves focus and steepen. The theoretical predictions of the local transport agree with the experiments, particularly for smaller bandwidth packets where the NLSE approximation is most valid. These findings highlight that it is the local steepness of the wave field, not just the sum of the steepnesses of the linear (non-interacting) wave components, which sets the strength of these enhancements.</description>

      <title>Vortex ring-cylinder interactions: regimes, reconnection, and the role of topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between vortex rings and cylindrical obstacles using direct numerical simulations across a wide range of geometric and dynamical parameters. The flow is characterized in terms of the diameter ratio between ring and object $T_D = d/D$, the Reynolds number based on circulation $Re_\Gamma$, and the slenderness ratio $\Lambda$. By systematically varying $T_D$ and $Re_\Gamma$, we identify three distinct interaction regimes: the wire, cutting, and wall regimes. In the wire regime ($T_D \lesssim 0.05$), the primary vortex ring survives the interaction with limited deformation and carries a weak lobe of secondary vorticity generated by the object's boundary layer. As $T_D$ increases, the interaction transitions to the cutting regime, where the ring is split into two secondary structures formed through the reconnection between boundary-layer and ring vorticity. For sufficiently large obstacles ($T_D \gtrsim 0.8$), the wall regime emerges, in which boundary-layer vorticity dominates and the primary ring is deflected and stretched along the obstacle surface. The transition between regimes depends primarily on $T_D$, while increasing $Re_\Gamma$ enhances vortical dynamics producing additional small-scale and tertiary structures. Finally, by modifying the topology of the obstacle, we demonstrate that reconnection and recovery of the primary ring depend critically on the topology of the secondary vorticity. These results provide a unified framework for interpreting vortex-body interactions, bridging the gap between vortex ring, tube, and wall collision dynamics.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic Study of Evaporation-Driven Crystallization of Saline and Ammonia Brines under Hydrogen Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground storage of hydrogen and ammonia in geological formations is essential for renewable energy integration, but salt precipitation during gas injection may threaten storage performance. While extensively studied for CO2 systems, precipitation mechanisms in hydrogen-brine and ammonia-brine systems remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive microfluidic investigation of salt crystallization during hydrogen injection into saline and ammonia-containing brines using high-pressure microfluidics. We conducted 81 high-pressure experiments systematically varying brine composition (1-5 mol/kg NaCl), chemical additives (surfactants, alcohols, ammonia), and hydrogen flow rates (200-1300 mL/min). Quantitative image analysis reveals that hydrogen-induced precipitation differs fundamentally from CO2 systems. Hydrogen drives physical precipitation via evaporation and capillary trapping, producing discrete, localized deposits. In contrast, CO2-ammonia systems generate extensive reactive precipitation of ammonium bicarbonate with interconnected crystal networks. Interfacial tension (IFT) controls both residual brine distribution and final crystal coverage: high-IFT fluids form large, interconnected brine pools promoting extensive crystallization, while low-IFT fluids create isolated pools reducing crystal coverage by 50\%. Alcohol and surfactant additives suppress precipitation by enhancing brine mobility, whereas ammonia paradoxically increases crystal fractions despite lower IFT. Higher flow rates accelerate crystallization across all compositions, enabling operational mitigation strategies. and demonstrate that gas-specific, rather than CO2-analog, risk assessments are essential for underground hydrogen storage design. The effectiveness of chemical additives offers promising pathways for near-wellbore protection in underground hydrogen storage operations.</description>

      <title>The impact of pressure oscillations on bubble rising in shear-thinning fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rising dynamics of a bubble driven into periodic volumetric oscillations by an external pressure driving within a highly viscous shear-thinning fluid. We perform axisymmetric direct numerical simulations employing the Carreau-Yasuda model to describe the rheological behavior of the fluid. We carry out a parametric study of the bubble rising dynamics, changing the amplitude and the frequency of the external pressure driving, and the bubble radius. Due to the external pressure oscillations, the bubble undergoes volume changes that strain the liquid at much larger rates than those due to natural rising, causing the surrounding fluid viscosity to thin. The numerical results show that the rising dynamics become highly nonlinear and unsteady due to the interplay of the shear-thinning rheology and the external driving. As a result, the period-averaged rising velocity of the bubble can increase by orders of magnitude compared to its natural rising velocity. These nonlinear effects become progressively more important as the amplitude and the frequency of the pressure driving or the bubble radius are increased. Qualitatively, the simulation model agrees with previous experimental findings in terms of average rising velocity. However, the experiments exhibit terminal velocities that are smaller than those predicted numerically, along with differences in bubble shape during the ascent. These discrepancies may be attributed to modeling the fluid rheology as a generalized Newtonian fluid rather than as a viscoelastic one.</description>

      <title>Are heuristic switches necessary to control artificial viscosity in modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial viscosity is commonly employed in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model dissipation in hydrodynamic simulations. However, its practical implementation relies on complex numerical switches to restrict its application to regions where dissipation is physically warranted, such as shocks. These switches, while essential, are imperfect and can introduce additional numerical noise. In this work we develop and validate a more efficient artificial viscosity scheme for SPH that does not rely on heuristic switches. Recent studies have proposed that subtracting the linear component of the velocity field can suppress spurious dissipation in shear-dominated regions. Building on this idea, we implement a velocity-reconstruction technique that removes the bulk linear motion from the local velocity field and uses the Balsara correction to modulate the dissipation. The presented methodology yields a balanced dissipation scheme that performs well across a range of regimes, including subsonic instabilities, shear flows, and strong shocks. We demonstrate that this approach yields improved accuracy and lower spurious dissipation compared to conventional artificial viscosity switches</description>

      <title>Performance of an open-source image-based history matching framework for CO$_2$ storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a history matching (HM) workflow applied to the International FluidFlower benchmark study dataset, which features high-resolution images of CO$_2$ storage in a meter-scale, geologically complex reservoir. The dataset provides dense spatial and temporal observations of fluid displacement, offering a rare opportunity to validate and enhance HM techniques for geological carbon storage (GCS). The combination of detailed experimental data and direct visual observation of flow behavior at this scale is novel and valuable. This study explores the potential and limitations of using experimental data to calibrate standard models for GCS simulation. By leveraging high-resolution images and resulting interpretations of fluid phase distributions, we adjust uncertain parameters and reduce the mismatch between simulation results and observed data. Simulations are performed using the open-source OPM Flow simulator, while the open-source Everest decision-making tool is employed to conduct the HM. After the HM process, the final simulation results show good agreement with the experimental CO$_2$ storage data. This suggests that the system can be effectively described using standard flow equations, conventional saturation functions, and typical PVT properties for CO$_2$-brine mixtures. Our results demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance is a particularly effective metric for matching multi-phase, multi-component flow data. The entire workflow is implemented in a Python package named pofff (Python OPM Flow FluidFlower), which organizes all functionality through a single input file. This design ensures reproducibility and facilitates future extensions of the study.</description>

      <title>Space-time resonances in the spatiotemporal spectrum of nonlinear dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In weakly nonlinear dispersive wave systems, long-time dynamics are typically governed by time resonances, where wave phases evolve coherently due to exact frequency matching. Recent advances in spatio-temporal spectrum measurements, however, reveal prominent features that go beyond the predictions of time resonance theory. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to interpret these signatures by identifying and characterizing an alternative mechanism: space resonances. These arise when wave packets share the same group velocity and remain co-located, leading to long-lived interactions. We further show that gauge-breaking terms in the Hamiltonian give rise to space resonances supported on negative frequencies. By combining sea-surface elevation data, numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we derive the leading-order spatio-temporal spectrum for weakly interacting water waves, providing a unified explanation for its observed features.</description>

      <title>Coupled imbibition and evaporation of droplets deposited on a nanoporous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquids in hydrophilic pores of nanoscale dimensions have capillary pressures so large that they can theoretically climb several kilometers against gravity. But droplets deposited on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts that stop advancing at typically a fraction of a millimeter, because of evaporation. Recently, there has been growing interest in such droplet infiltration dynamics, either as a way to study the behavior of confined fluids, or in connection with applications e.g. in water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuating, sensing, etc. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile liquid droplets into a thin porous layer with pores of nanometric dimensions (mesopores) and its dependency on the imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach to describe the dynamics of the imbibition annulus (halo), which corrects for a neglected coupling between imbibition and evaporation fluxes, describes halos of arbitrary dimensions with respect to droplet size, and incorporates confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we show that the timescales of halo formation diverge at a critical RH, due to the Kelvin effect. Our analysis also shows an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, which cannot be explained by standard capillary models. This observation suggests an important role of vapor transport and condensation along the porous surface. Globally, our results indicate that droplet infiltration in porous layers involve complex couplings, and that one should be cautious when interpreting halo dynamics data. Our study also suggests RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns.</description>

      <title>On an Analytical Criterion for Detecting Intermittent Turbulent Behaviour of Solutions of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main question in the study of partial differential equations is the following: how do we understand the nature of the solutions and, in particular, how do we determine if a given solution shows turbulent or non-turbulent behaviour? Being able to answer such a question would be a major advance in the comprehension of the nature of turbulence. In this paper we focus on the case of intermittent turbulence and provide an analytical criterion, based on the crest factor, which captures the essential feature of the solutions. By computing the crest factor for the solutions of some classical equations, both linear and nonlinear, we illustrate the capability of the criterion for discerning between solutions exhibiting time-intermittent turbulence behaviour and solutions which either are not turbulent or show statistically stationary turbulence, like, for example, in the case described by Kolmogorov's theory.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of meshless methods via resolving power optimisation using multiple kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meshless methods are commonly used to determine numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) for problems involving free surfaces and/or complex geometries, approximating spatial derivatives at collocation points via local kernels with a finite size. Despite their common use in turbulent flow simulations, the accuracy of meshless methods has typically been assessed using their convergence characteristics resulting from the polynomial consistency of approximations to operators, with little to no attention paid to the resolving power of the approximation. Here we provide a framework for the optimisation of resolving power by exploiting the non-uniqueness of kernels to provide improvements to numerical approximations of spatial derivatives. We first demonstrate that, unlike in finite-difference approximations, the resolving power of meshless methods is dependent not only on the magnitude of the wavenumber, but also its orientation, before using linear combinations of kernels to maximise resolving power over a range of wavenumbers. The new approach shows improved accuracy in convergence tests and has little impact on stability of time-dependent problems for a range of Eulerian meshless methods. Solutions to a variety of PDE systems are computed, with significant gains in accuracy for no extra computational cost per timestep in Eulerian frameworks. The improved resolution characteristics provided by the optimisation procedure presented herein enable accurate simulation of systems of PDEs whose solution contains short spatial scales such as flow fields with homogeneous isotropic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Aging in the Flow Dynamics of Dense Suspensions of Contactless Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.</description>

      <title>Brain pulsations enhance cerebrospinal fluid flow in perivascular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach is adopted to model cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in human perivascular spaces (PVSs) surrounding brain-penetrating arteries. It is proposed that the outer PVS boundary oscillates due to brain pulsations and the arterial wall motion is driven by a blood pressure wave. Lubrication theory is employed to derive a mathematical model for the CSF flow, which is then solved numerically. A parametric analysis is undertaken to investigate the effect of the brain pulsations, which shows that pulsations magnify the net axial CSF flows created by the arterial wall motion. The findings suggest that net axial CSF flows are almost entirely positive (deeper into the brain), with arterial wall motion highly dependent on PVS-penetrating artery configurations. Given the glymphatic hypothesis, the findings support the clinical practice of treating dilated PVS as indicators of an increased likelihood of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia.</description>

      <title>Flux-driven turbulent transport using penalisation in the Hasegawa-Wakatani system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First numerical results from the newly-developed pseudo-spectral code P-FLARE (Penalised FLux-driven Algorithm for REduced models) are presented. This flux-driven turbulence/transport code uses a pseudo-spectral formulation with the penalisation method in order to impose radial boundary conditions. Its concise, flexible structure allows implementing various quasi-two dimensional reduced fluid models in flux-driven formulation. Here, results from simulations of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system are discussed, where particle transport and zonal flow formation, together with profile relaxation, are studied. It is shown that coupled spreading/profile relaxation that one obtains for this system is consistent with a simple one dimensional model of coupled spreading/transport equations. Then, the effect of a particle source is investigated, which results in the observation of sandpile-like critical behaviour. The model displays profile stiffness for certain parameters, with very different input fluxes resulting in very similar mean density gradients. This is due to different zonal flow levels around the critical value for the control parameter (i.e. the ratio of the adiabaticity parameter to the mean gradient) and the existence for this system of a hysteresis loop for the transition from 2D turbulence to a zonal flow dominated state.</description>

Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</description>
