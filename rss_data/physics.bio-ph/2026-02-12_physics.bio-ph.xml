      <title>Whodunnit? The case of midge swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As collective states of animal groups go, swarms of midge insects pose a number of puzzling questions. Their ordering polarization parameter is quite small and the insects are weakly coupled among themselves but strongly coupled to the swarm. In laboratory studies (free of external perturbations), the correlation length is small, whereas midge swarms exhibit strong correlations, scale free behavior and power laws for correlation length, susceptibility and correlation time in field studies. Data for the dynamic correlation function versus time collapse to a single curve only for small values of time scaled with the correlation time. Is there a theory that explains these disparate observations? Among the existing theories, whodunnit? Here we review and discuss several models proposed in the literature and extend our own one, the harmonically confined Vicsek model, to anisotropic confinement. Numerical simulations of the latter produce elongated swarm shapes and values of the static critical exponents between those of the two dimensional and isotropic three dimensional models. The new values agree better with those measured in natural swarms.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Optimization of Sensory Adaptation via Game-Theoretic Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological sensory systems, from \textit{E.~coli} chemotaxis to sensory neurons in \textit{C.~elegans}, achieve reliable adaptation over wide dynamic ranges despite operating in strongly noisy and overdamped regimes. Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \approx \tau \gamma$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 &gt; 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Response Design Rules for Nonequilibrium Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological machines like molecular motors and enzymes operate in dynamic cycles representable as stochastic flows on networks. Current stochastic dynamics describes such flows on fixed networks. Here, we develop a scalable approach to network design in which local transition rates can be systematically varied to achieve global dynamical objectives. It is based on the fluctuation-response duality in the recent Caliber Force Theory -- a path-entropy variational formalism for nonequilibria. This approach scales efficiently with network complexity and gives new insights, for example revealing the transition from timing- to branching-dominated fluctuations in a kinesin motor model.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Enhanced Coercive Field by Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect demonstrates a strong coupling between electron spin and molecular chirality, enabling spin-controlled interactions between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. While CISS experiments have revealed robust changes in the spin-polarization properties of magnetic materials upon chiral molecular adsorption, the temperature dependence of these effects remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the chirality-induced increase in magnetic coercivity by ribose-aminooxazoline (RAO) crystals on ferromagnetic surfaces. RAO was selected as a conglomerate-forming, thermodynamically stable crystalline chiral organic molecule with prebiotic relevance that has previously been shown to induce strong spin-dependent changes in magnetic minerals. Contrary to classical expectations that magnetic coercivity weakens at elevated temperatures, we observe a significant increase in magnetic coercivity (1 mT over a 60 C temperature change) with increasing temperature. These results support a vibronic contribution to CISS arising from electron-phonon interactions and demonstrate that spin-dependent interactions between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces can become more effective at higher temperatures, providing new insight into the microscopic origins of CISS and the environmental robustness of spin-controlled asymmetric processes.</description>

      <title>Scalable Spatio-Temporal SE(3) Diffusion for Long-Horizon Protein Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain the gold standard for studying protein dynamics, but their computational cost limits access to biologically relevant timescales. Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.</description>
