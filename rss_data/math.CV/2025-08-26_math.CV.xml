      <title>Quasisymmetric Koebe Uniformization of metric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study when a metric surface $X$ can be mapped quasisymmetrically onto a circle domain $D\subset\mathbb{C}$ with uniformly relatively separated boundary components. Bonk \cite{Bonk} proved that if $X\subset \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ and the boundary components of $X$ are uniformly relatively separated uniform quasicircles then $X$ is quasisymmetric to a circle domain. Merenkov and Wildrick \cite{Merenkov Wildrick} showed that Bonk's condition is not sufficient in the non-planar case. We prove that under some mild assumptions, a metric surface is quasisymmetric to a circle domain with uniformly relatively separated boundary components if and only if it is 2-TLP. The latter is a version of a condition introduced and studied by Bonk \cite{Bonk}. This answers a question of Merenkov and Wildrick in \cite{Merenkov Wildrick} and it is also a natural generalization of Bonk's result to non-planar metric surfaces.</description>

      <title>On a sharp form of curvature conjecture for minimal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the author and Melentijevi\'c resolved the longstanding Gaussian curvature problem by proving the sharp inequality \[ |\mathcal{K}| &lt; c_0 = \frac{\pi^2}{2} \] for minimal graphs over the unit disk, evaluated at the point of the graph lying directly above the origin. The constant \( c_0 \) is known as the \emph{Heinz constant}. Building on this result, we obtain an improved estimate for the Hopf constant \( c_1 \). In addition, we show that for any prescribed unit normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \), there exists a minimal graph over the unit disk -- bending in the coordinate directions -- whose Gaussian curvature at the point above the origin is strictly smaller, yet arbitrarily close to, the curvature of the associated Scherk-type surface with the same normal, situated above a bicentric quadrilateral. This sharp inequality strengthens the classical result of Finn and Osserman, which applies in the special case when the unit normal is \( (0,0,1) \).</description>

      <title>Handlebodies of Infinite Genus and Schottky Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we begin an investigation of infinite genus handlebodies, infinitely generated Schottky groups, and related uniformization questions by giving appropriate definitions for them. There are uncountably many topological types of infinite genus surfaces with non-planar ends. We show that any such surface and any infinite genus handlebody can be topologically uniformized by an infinitely generated classical Schottky group. We next show that an infinite genus Riemann surface with non-planar ends admitting a bounded pants decomposition can be quasiconformally uniformized by a classical Schottky group. In addition, the conformal equivalence class of such a uniformization is unique.If the assumption of bounded pants decomposition is removed we supply examples of such Riemann surfaces that do not admit a quasiconformal uniformization by a Schottky group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of polynomial-like maps is of fundamental importance in holomorphic dynamics. We study dynamical properties of a larger class of maps. Our main result is that, under some natural conditions, a map of this class has a completely invariant compact set if and only if this set is the filled Julia set of a polynomial-like restriction of the map. We also generalize this result to include maps with non-connected domains of definition.</description>

      <title>Integer-valued polynomials satisfying growth constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider polynomials which take integer values on the integers (IVPs), and satisfy an additional growth condition on the natural numbers. Elkies and Speyer, answering a question by Dimitrov, showed there is a critical exponential growth threshold, such that there are infinitely many IVPs with growth above the threshold and finitely many IVPs below that threshold (of arbitrary degree). In this paper, we give more refined estimates for the number of IVPs having exponential growth thresholds. In addition, we consider a similar problem, where there is a (not necessarily symmetric) growth condition on the integers. Notably, the critical threshold is determined by the logarithmic capacity of an explicit domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a result of Bump et al. to show that a large family of Sheffer sequences has their zeros - up to perhaps a finite number of exceptions - on a vertical line. We connect a particular such sequence to the Riemann zeta function via a product representation of a scaled Mellin transform, analogously to the product decomposition of a Mellin transform involving the generalized Laguerre polynomials into factors of the Gamma function and Meixner polynomials.</description>

      <title>Exhaustions of circle domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Koebe's conjecture asserts that every domain in the Riemann sphere is conformally equivalent to a circle domain. We prove that every domain $\Omega$ satisfying Koebe's conjecture admits an exhaustion, i.e., a sequence of interior approximations by finitely connected domains, so that the associated conformal maps onto finitely connected circle domains converge to a conformal map $f$ from $\Omega$ onto a circle domain. Thus, if Koebe's conjecture is true, it can be proved by utilizing interior approximations of a domain.
  The main ingredient in the proof is the construction of quasiround exhaustions of a given circle domain $\Omega$. In the case of such exhaustions, if $\partial \Omega$ has area zero, we show that $f$ is a M\"obius transformation. The paper builds upon a range of tools, including planar topology, Voronoi cells, classical and modern methods in (quasi)conformal mapping theory, the transboundary modulus of Schramm, and the dynamics of Schottky groups.</description>

      <title>On the virtual invariants of zero entropy groups of compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. We study subgroups $G \le \mathrm{Aut}(X)$ of biholomorphic automorphisms of zero entropy when $\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is compact (e.g. when $\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is trivial). We show that the virtual derived length $\ell_{\mathrm{vir}}(G)$ of $G$ satisfies $\ell_{\mathrm{vir}}(G) \le \dim X -\kappa(X)$, where $\kappa(X)$ is the Kodaira dimension of $X$. Modulo the main conjecture of our previous work concerning the essential nilpotency class, we obtain the same upper bound $c_{\mathrm{vir}}(G) \le \dim X -\kappa(X)$ for the virtual nilpotency class $c_{\mathrm{vir}}(G)$, together with a geometric description of the $G$-action on $X$ when the equality holds.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <title>Fractal Zeta Functions and Complex Dimensions of Ahlfors Metric Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While classical analysis dealt primarily with smooth spaces, much research has been done in the last half century on expanding the theory to the nonsmooth case. Metric Measure spaces are the natural setting for such analysis, and it is thus important to understand the geometry of subsets of these spaces. In this paper we will focus on the geometry of Ahlfors regular spaces, Metric Measure spaces with an additional regularity condition. Historically, fractals have been studied using different ideas of dimension which have all proven to be unsatisfactory to some degree. The theory of complex dimensions, developed by M.L. Lapidus and a number of collaborators, was developed in part to better understand fractality in the Euclidean case and seeks to overcome these problems. Of particular interest is the recent theory of complex dimensions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, as studied by M.L. Lapidus, G. Radunovi\'c, and D. Zubrini\'c, who introduced and studied the properties of the distance zeta function $\zeta_A$. We will show that this theory of complex dimensions naturally generalizes to the case of Ahlfors regular spaces, as the distance zeta function can be modified to these spaces and all of its main properties carry over. We also provide a selection of examples in Ahlfors spaces, as well as hints that the theory can be expanded to a more general setting.</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Independence of a Set of Generalized Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215\ldots$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)})$ based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set $\{\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e\}_{n\geq0}$, and thus the transcendence of $\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e$ for all $n\geq0$. This further implies the disjunctive transcendence of both pairs $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e)$ and $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)})$ for all $n\geq1$.</description>
