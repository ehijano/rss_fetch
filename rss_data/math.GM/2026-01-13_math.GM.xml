      <title>Quantitative local inversion and a minimax depth barrier for canonical systems from fixed-height Weyl-Schur seam data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $\Lambda&gt;0$ and consider trace-normed $2\times 2$ canonical systems $\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;-1\\1&amp;0\end{pmatrix}Y'(s)=zH(s)Y(s)$ on $[0,\Lambda]$, extended by the free tail $H(s)=\frac12 I$ for $s\ge\Lambda$. The Weyl-Titchmarsh coefficient $m_{H,\Lambda}$ and its Cayley transform $v$ encode the spectral measure. We study the finite sampling operator (the seam map) that sends $H$ (or a finite-dimensional parameter $\theta$) to the values $v(z_k)$ at points $z_k=x_k+i\eta$ with $\eta&gt;0$, $k=1,\dots,M$. For piecewise-constant (block) Hamiltonians, with block length $\ell=\Lambda/N$, we analyze stability and optimal sampling. We prove three types of results. (1) The free tail forces the transfer matrix at $\Lambda$ to have entire entries of exponential type at most $\Lambda$; consequently $m_{H,\Lambda}$ and $v$ extend meromorphically to $\mathbb{C}$, showing that the free-tail class is a strict spectral subclass. (2) Fixed-height data is intrinsically smoothed: $\operatorname{Im} m(\cdot+i\eta)$ is the Poisson extension of the spectral measure, yielding an exponential minimax obstruction to recovering oscillatory spectral features from finitely many noisy samples. (3) Linearization at the free Hamiltonian identifies seam sampling with an evaluation operator in a Paley-Wiener/de Branges space, so stability is governed by kernel frame bounds; shifted equispaced designs give optimal tight frames and explicit conditioning estimates. Finally, a perturbation formula expresses $Dm$ as an $L^2([0,\Lambda];\mathbb{R}^2,H)$ pairing with $\Delta H$, linking depth attenuation to decay of Weyl solutions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Classification of All 880 Fourth-Order Magic Squares and the Discovery of Complete Alternating Magic Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a newly defined algebraic invariant for square matrices termed the \emph{Alternating Power Difference (APD)}. The APD is defined as the signed sum of the powers of diagonal sums along permutations of the symmetric group, distinguishing between even and odd permutations. It serves as a measure of the broken even-odd symmetry inherent in a matrix through higher-order moments.
  We applied this invariant to all 880 essentially different normal $4\times4$ magic squares (excluding symmetries) and defined the \emph{First Appearance Degree} $m_1$ as the minimum power at which the APD first becomes non-zero. Through an exhaustive computational search, we found that these magic squares are categorized into three clearly separated classes: $m_1=3$ (240 squares), $m_1=4$ (624 squares), and $m_1=\infty$ (16 squares).
  In particular, the case $m_1=\infty$ identifies exceptionally rare magic squares for which the APD vanishes at all degrees. We refer to these as \emph{Complete Alternating Magic Squares} and demonstrate that they possess a strong algebraic symmetry undetectable by conventional geometric classifications or link-line patterns. Furthermore, we reveal that the APD-based classification refines the classical link-line classification based on complementary sum pairs, showing that each geometric type is clearly distinguished by its first appearance degree.
  All results in this paper are based on exhaustive computations and are fully reproducible. Our findings suggest that the APD is an effective new invariant for detecting hidden algebraic structures in magic squares and related combinatorial matrices.</description>

      <title>New ideas to the design of algorithms based on derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes new perspectives for developing derivative based numerical algorithms, supported by the introduction of a generalized derivative operators. It demonstrates that these operators have the potential to enhance and extend existing derivativebased numerical methods. To this end, two iterative derivative driven methods are examined and refined: the Newton Raphson method and the Gradient method. For both approaches, generalized derivatives are introduced with the goal of reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. These modifications are presented through geometric interpretations of the proposed constructions, which clearly illustrate their convergenceaccelerating properties. The concluding remarks emphasize the significant opportunity to advance and refine numerical algorithms through the use of generalized derivatives.</description>

      <title>Analyze the Density of Words over Morphism $\{a,b\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the density of the Fibonacci word and its derived forms by examining the morphisms associated with each. It offers a comparative analysis of the density of Fibonacci numbers alongside other words derived from Fibonacci word. Fibonacci words over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$, we define a novel \emph{power} operation that yields a formal linear combination in the free abelian group generated by all finite words.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the Collatz Conjecture modulo $2^p+2^q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will introduce an extension to the Collatz's conjecture. This conjecture may be seen as a general conjecture that unifies the Collatz one together with many other similar conjectures. For instance, we propose our new conjecture modulo $10$ which may be stated as follows. Starting from any positive integer,
  if it is a multiple of $10$ then divide it by 10, otherwise, multiply it by $12$, add $8$ times its last digit and divide the result by $10$. Repeat the process infinitely. Regardless the starting number, the process eventually reaches $4$ after a finite number of iterations. The genaral conjecture studied here will encompasse the classical Collatz conjecture togher with our proposed one modulo $10$.</description>

      <title>Constructing left-continuous triangular norms on complete lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the construction of left-continuous t-norms on complete lattices. The concepts of $\mathfrak{f}$-mappings and weak $\mathfrak{f}$-mappings on complete lattices are first introduced, respectively. They are then applied to establish the following key results: weak $\mathfrak{f}$-mappings are used to induce left-continuous t-subnorms; $\mathfrak{f}$-mappings are used to generate left-continuous t-norms whenever the top element $1$ of the complete lattice is a completely join-irreducible element. Finally, some necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for an operator constructed by the ordinal sum of a series of annihilating binary operators being a left-continuous t-norm on a complete lattice.</description>

      <title>Optimal Equivariant Matchings on the 6-Cube: With an Application to the King Wen Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize perfect matchings on the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n that are equivariant under the Klein four-group K_4 generated by bitwise complement and reversal. For n = 6, we prove there exists a unique K_4-equivariant matching minimizing total Hamming cost among matchings using only comp or rev pairings, achieving cost 120 versus 192 for the complement-only matching. The optimal matching is determined by a simple "reverse-priority rule": pair each element with its reversal unless it is a palindrome, in which case pair with its complement. We verify that the historically significant King Wen sequence of the I Ching is isomorphic to this optimal matching. Notably, allowing comp(rev) pairings yields lower cost (96), but the King Wen sequence follows the structurally simpler rule. All results are formally verified in Lean 4 with the Mathlib library.</description>

      <title>Non-Existence of Linear-Quartic Factorization for the Second Cuboid Quintic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q_{p,q}(t)\in\mathbb{Z}[t]$ be Sharipov's even monic degree-$10$ second cuboid polynomial depending on coprime integers $p\neq q&gt;0$. Writing $Q_{p,q}(t)$ as a quintic in $t^{2}$ produces an associated monic quintic polynomial. After the weighted normalization $r=p/q$ and $s=r^{2}$ we obtain a one-parameter family $P_s(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that \[ Q_{p,q}(t)=q^{20}\,P_s\!\left(\frac{t^{2}}{q^{4}}\right)\qquad\text{with}\qquad s=\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{2}. \] We show that for every rational $s&gt;0$ with $s\neq 1$ the equation $P_s(x)=0$ has no rational solutions. Equivalently, $P_s$ admits no $1+4$ factorization over $\mathbb{Q}$.
  The proof uses an explicit quotient by the inversion involution $(s,y)\mapsto(1/s,1/y)$ and reduces the rational-root problem for $P_s$ to rational points on the fixed genus-$2$ hyperelliptic curve \[ C:\quad w^2=t^5+21t^4+26t^3+10t^2+5t+1=(t+1)(t^4+20t^3+6t^2+4t+1). \] Using Magma and Chabauty's method on the Jacobian of $C$, we compute $C(\mathbb{Q})$ exactly and conclude that the only parameter value producing a rational root is the excluded case $s=1$ (equivalently $p=q$).
  As a consequence, for coprime $p\neq q&gt;0$ the polynomial $Q_{p,q}(t)$ has no rational roots (hence no linear factor over $\mathbb{Q}$, and in particular no linear factor over $\mathbb{Z}$).</description>
