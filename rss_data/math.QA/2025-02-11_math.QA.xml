      <title>Automorphism group schemes of lattice vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive definite even lattice and a commutative ring, there is a standard construction of a lattice vertex algebra over the commutative ring, and this is promoted to a vertex operator algebra when the determinant of the lattice is invertible. We describe the groups of automorphisms of these vertex algebras and vertex operator algebras as affine group schemes, showing in particular that each is an extension of an explicitly described split reductive group of ADE type by the outer automorphism group of the lattice.</description>

      <title>The formality of the Goldman--Turaev Lie bialgebra on a closed surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the Kashiwara--Vergne groups and associators in higher genera, introduced in Alekseev--Kawazumi--Kuno--Naef, in terms of non-commutative connections using the tools developed in a previous paper. As the main result, the case of closed surfaces is dealt with to determine the pro-nilpotent automorphism group of the associated graded of the Goldman--Turaev Lie bialgebra.</description>

      <title>On representations of the crystallization of the quantized function algebra C(SUq(n + 1))</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystallization C(SU0(n + 1)) of the q-family of C*-algebras C(SUq(n + 1)) was defined by Giri &amp; Pal for all n \geq 2 and they observed that any irreducible representation at the q = 0 level is the norm limit of irreducible representations of C(SUq(n + 1)) as q\to 0+. In this article, we will generalize this to any non-degenerate representation (respectively faithful) of C(SU0(n+1)). As a consequence, one can alternatively realize C(SU0(n+1)) as the C*-algebra generated by the limit operators of faithful representations of C(SUq(n+1)).</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Problems in Categories of Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categories of partitions are combinatorial structures arising from the representation theory of certain compact quantum groups and are linked to classical diagram algebras such as the Temperley-Lieb algebra. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms and data-structures for partitions of sets and their corresponding category operations, including a concrete implementation in the computer algebra system OSCAR. Moreover, we show that there exists a category of partitions for which the natural computational problems of deciding membership of a given partition as well as counting partitions of a given size are algorithmically undecidable.</description>

      <title>A Coboundary Temperely-Lieb Category for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By considering a suitable renormalization of the Temperley--Lieb category, we study its specialization to the case $q=0$. Unlike the $q\neq 0$ case, the obtained monoidal category, $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$, is not rigid or braided. We provide a closed formula for the Jones--Wenzl projectors in $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and give semisimple bases for its endomorphism algebras. We explain how to obtain the same basis using the representation theory of finite inverse monoids, via the associated M\"obius inversion. We then describe a coboundary structure on $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and show that its idempotent completion is coboundary monoidally equivalent to the category of $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$-crystals. This gives a diagrammatic description of the commutor for $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$-crystals defined by Henriques and Kamnitzer and of the resulting action of the cactus group. We also study fiber functors of $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and discuss how they differ from the $q\neq 0$ case.</description>

      <title>Some characterizations of weak left braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generalizations of skew left braces, weak left braces were introduced recently by Catino, Mazzotta, Miccoli and Stefanelli to study ceratin special degenerate set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In this note, as analogues of the notions of regular subgroups of holomorph of groups and Gamma functions on groups, we propose the notions of good inverse subsemigroups and Gamma functions associated to Clifford semigroups, respectively, by which weak left braces are characterized. Moreover, symmetric, $\lambda$-homomorphic and $\lambda$-anti-homomorphic weak left braces are introduced and the algebraic structures of these weak left braces are given.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize some results in our previous work on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove the equivalence of VOA tensor categories and conformal net tensor categories for the following examples: all WZW models; all lattice VOAs; all unitary parafermion VOAs; type $ADE$ discrete series $W$-algebras; their tensor products; their regular cosets. A new proof of the complete rationality of conformal nets is also given.</description>

      <title>The classification of vertex operator algebras of OZ-type generated by Ising vectors of $\sigma$-type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify vertex operator algebras (VOAs) of OZ-type generated by Ising vectors of $\sigma$-type. As a consequence of the classification, we also prove that such VOAs are simple, rational, $C_2$-cofinite and unitary, that is, they have compact real forms generated by Ising vectors of $\sigma$-type over the real numbers.</description>

Abstract: Through the introduction of new ideals, and with the assistance of the $d$-th mode transition algebras $\mathfrak{A}_d$, for $d\in \mathbb{N}$, we show how Zhu's associative algebra $\mathsf{A}$, conventionally valued for tracking information about the degree $0$ part of an $\mathbb{N}$-graded module over a vertex operator algebra $V$, also contains information about components of higher degree. As an application, equivalent conditions are given for rationality of $V$, and explicit presentations for higher-level Zhu algebras are given, including for a large class of non-rational VOAs.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analyses of the Type D ASEP: Stochastic Fusion and Crystal Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Type D asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a particle system involving two classes of particles that can be viewed from both a probabilistic and an algebraic perspective (arXiv:2011.13473). From a probabilistic perspective, we perform stochastic fusion on the Type D ASEP and analyze the outcome on generator matrices, limits of drift speed, stationary distributions, and Markov self-duality. From an algebraic perspective, we construct a fused Type D ASEP system from a Casimir element of $U_q(so_6)$, using crystal bases to analyze and manipulate various representations of $U_q(so_6)$. We conclude that both approaches produce different processes and therefore the previous method of arXiv:1908.02359, which analyzed the usual ASEP, does not generalize to all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a case study of probabilistic approach to topological quantum field theory via the example of topological quantum mechanics. We propose that the topological correlations are realized in the large variance limit.
