      <title>Elastic rods and elastic spinning rings as gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linearised relativistic elasticity equations of motion are considered for a rod and a spinning ring encountering a gravitational wave. In the case of the rod, the equations reduce to a wave equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Using Fourier transforms, the resonant frequencies are found and an explicit distributional solution is given, both for a plus- and a cross-polarised gravitational wave. In the case of the spinning ring, the equations are coupled wave equations with periodic boundary conditions. Using a Fourier series expansion, the system of wave equations is recast as a family of ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients, which are then solved via Fourier transforms. The resonant frequencies are found, including simple approximate expressions for slowly rotating rings, and an explicit distributional solution is obtained in the case of the non-spinning ring. Interestingly, it is possible to tune the resonant frequencies by adjusting the angular velocity of the spinning ring.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Asymmetry in Density within the Shear Bands of Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plastic deformation in metallic glasses at room temperature leads to the development of shear bands due to shear localization. In many experiments, shear bands have shown local density variations along their path, with a distinct imbalance in magnitude between local densification and dilation. However, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding or theory to explain this asymmetry has been lacking until now. Here, we introduce a new model that consists of a sequential arrangement of alternating topological 'charges', generating a dipolar field. The resulting microscopic displacement field, when integrated into the deformation gradient tensor, provides an accurate analytical solution for the observed imbalances in the density variations. The implications of this method are discussed, highlighting the potential to elucidate a broader range of observations in shear bands.</description>

      <title>Interference aided finite resonant response in an undamped forced oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04125v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply perturbative techniques to a driven undamped sinusoidal oscillator at resonance. The angular displacement, $\theta$, obeys the dynamics $\Ddot{\theta} + \omega^{2} \sin{\theta} = H\cos{\omega t}$. The linearized approximation gives a divergent response (at long times) but the nonlinear terms make the response finite. We address the nonlinearity-induced finiteness in two ways by separately treating the short and long time scales. At long times, we use the traditional perturbative techniques to extract two drive dependent behaviours - one, the amplitude of oscillation scales as $(H/\omega^{2})^{1/3}$ and, two, the time period of the slow mode varies as $(H/\omega^{2})^{-2/3}$. For the early time behaviour, on the other hand, we devise an alternate perturbative expansion where the successive terms get larger with the order of evaluation but have alternating signs. The alternating signs (phase differences) between these terms leads to adestructive interference like effect. A careful consideration of this destructive interference like effect between successive terms leads to a finite response which describes the initial behaviour of the amplitude of the response reasonably correctly. We further note that for larger drive values, the system seems to undergo a first order transitional behaviour with a sudden jump in the largest Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Scattering-Based Characteristic Mode Theory for Structures in Arbitrary Background: Computation, Benchmarks, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing substructure characteristic modes. This method leverages electromagnetic scattering matrices and spherical wave expansion to directly decompose electromagnetic fields. Unlike conventional methods that rely on the impedance matrix generated by the method of moments (MoM), our technique simplifies the problem into a small-scale ordinary eigenvalue problem, improving numerical dynamics and computational efficiency. We have developed analytical substructure characteristic mode solutions for a scenario involving two spheres, which can serve as benchmarks for evaluating other numerical solvers. A key advantage of our method is its independence from specific MoM frameworks, allowing for the use of various numerical methods. This flexibility paves the way for substructure characteristic mode decomposition to become a universal frequency-domain technique.</description>
