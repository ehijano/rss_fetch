      <title>Mathematical Formulations And Results Regarding Two Echelon Electric Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing need for sustainable logistics solutions has led to the evolution of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) into more complex variants that address modern challenges. Among these, the Two-Echelon Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (2E-EVRP) has emerged as a significant problem variant, integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into a multi-echelon distribution system. This problem considers environmental and operational constraints such as limited battery range, charging infrastructure, and urban logistics complexities. In this report, we present a comprehensive mathematical formulation for the 2E-EVRP and its variants, which include constraints like time windows, simultaneous pickup and delivery, and partial deliveries. These formulations aim to provide a robust framework for optimizing multi-tiered distribution networks using sustainable practices. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Permutation clones that preserve relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation clones generalise permutation groups and clone theory. We investigate permutation clones defined by relations, or equivalently, the automorphism groups of powers of relations. We find many structural results on the lattice of all relationally defined permutation clones on a finite set. We find all relationally defined permutation clones on two element set.
  We show that all maximal borrow closed permutation clones are either relationally defined or cancellatively defined.
  Permutation clones generalise clones to permutations of $A^n$. Emil Je\v{r}\'{a}bek found the dual structure to be weight mappings $A^k\rightarrow M$ to a commutative monoid, generalising relations. We investigate the case when the dual object is precisely a relation, equivalently, that $M={\mathbb B}$, calling these relationally defined permutation clones.
  We determine the number of relationally defined permutation clones on two elements (13).
  We note that many infinite classes of clones collapse when looked at as permutation clones.</description>

      <title>On the Bidirected Cut Relaxation for Steiner Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Steiner Forest problem is an important generalization of the Steiner Tree problem. We are given an undirected graph with nonnegative edge costs and a collection of pairs of vertices. The task is to compute a cheapest forest with the property that the elements of each pair belong to the same connected component of the forest. The current best approximation factor for Steiner Forest is 2, which is achieved by the classical primal-dual algorithm; improving on this factor is a big open problem in the area.
  Motivated by this open problem, we study an LP relaxation for Steiner Forest that generalizes the well-studied Bidirected Cut Relaxation for Steiner Tree. We prove that this relaxation has several promising properties. Among them, it is possible to round any half-integral LP solution to a Steiner Forest instance while increasing the cost by at most a factor 16/9. To prove this result we introduce a novel recursive densest-subgraph contraction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology: From Generalized Morse-Smale Dynamical Systems to Forman's Combinatorial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

      <title>On the Multi-Robber Damage Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Cops and Robbers game on graphs in which the robbers damage the visited vertices, aiming to maximize the number of damaged vertices. For that game with one cop against $s$ robbers a conjecture was made by Carlson, Halloran and Reinhart that the cop can save three vertices from being damaged as soon as the maximum degree of the base graph is at least $\binom{s}{2} + 2$.
  We are able to verify the conjecture and prove that it is tight once we add the assumption that the base graph is triangle free. We also study the game without that assumption, disproving the conjecture in full generality and further attempting to locate the smallest maximum degree of a base graph which guarantees that the cop can save three vertices against $s$ robbers. We show that this number is between $2\binom{s}{2} - 3$ and $2\binom{s}{2} + 1$.
  Furthermore, after the game has been previously studied with one cop and multiple robbers, as well as with one robber and multiple cops, we initiate the study of the game with two cops and two robbers. In the case when the base graph is a cycle we determine the exact number of damaged vertices. Additionally, when the base graph is a path we provide bounds that differ by an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>

      <title>Deterministic approximate counting of colorings with fewer than $2\Delta$ colors via absence of zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta,q\geq 3$ be integers. We prove that there exists $\eta\geq 0.002$ such that if $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$, then there exists an open set $\mathcal{U}\subset \mathbb{C}$ that contains the interval $[0,1]$ such that for each $w\in \mathcal{U}$ and any graph $G=(V,E)$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the partition function of the anti-ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model evaluated at $w$ does not vanish. This provides a (modest) improvement on a result of Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava, and breaks the $q=2\Delta$-barrier for this problem.
  As a direct consequence we obtain via Barvinok's interpolation method a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the number of proper $q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, provided $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT ``functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite some limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Better Approximation for Weighted $k$-Matroid Intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding an independent set of maximum weight simultaneously contained in $k$ matroids over a common ground set. This $k$-matroid intersection problem appears naturally in many contexts, for example in generalizing graph and hypergraph matching problems. In this paper, we provide a $(k+1)/(2 \ln 2)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted $k$-matroid intersection problem. This is the first improvement over the longstanding $(k-1)$-guarantee of Lee, Sviridenko and Vondr\'ak (2009). Along the way, we also give the first improvement over greedy for the more general weighted matroid $k$-parity problem.
  Our key innovation lies in a randomized reduction in which we solve almost unweighted instances iteratively. This perspective allows us to use insights from the unweighted problem for which Lee, Sviridenko, and Vondr\'ak have designed a $k/2$-approximation algorithm. We analyze this procedure by constructing refined matroid exchanges and leveraging randomness to avoid bad local minima.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Core Stability Relaxations in Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study relationships between different relaxed notions of core stability in hedonic games, which are a class of coalition formation games. Our unified approach applies to a newly introduced family of hedonic games, called $\alpha$-hedonic games, which contains previously studied variants such as fractional and additively separable hedonic games. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the maximum factor with which a blocking coalition of a certain size can improve upon an outcome in which no deviating coalition of size at most $q$ exists. Counterintuitively, we show that larger blocking coalitions might sometimes have lower improvement factors. We discuss the tightness conditions of our bound, as well as its implications on the price of anarchy of core relaxations. Our general result has direct implications for several well-studied classes of hedonic games, allowing us to prove two open conjectures by Fanelli et al. (2021) for fractional hedonic games.</description>
