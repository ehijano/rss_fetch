      <title>TORAX: A Fast and Differentiable Tokamak Transport Simulator in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06718v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TORAX, a new, open-source, differentiable tokamak core transport simulator implemented in Python using the JAX framework. TORAX solves the coupled equations for ion heat transport, electron heat transport, particle transport, and current diffusion, incorporating modular physics-based and ML models. JAX's just-in-time compilation ensures fast runtimes, while its automatic differentiation capability enables gradient-based optimization workflows and simplifies the use of Jacobian-based PDE solvers. Coupling to ML-surrogates of physics models is greatly facilitated by JAX's intrinsic support for neural network development and inference. TORAX is verified against the established RAPTOR code, demonstrating agreement in simulated plasma profiles. TORAX provides a powerful and versatile tool for accelerating research in tokamak scenario modeling, pulse design, and control.</description>

      <title>Invariant regimes of Spencer scaling law for magnetic compression of rotating FRC plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling laws for the magnetic compression of a toroidally rotating field reversed configuration (FRC) have been investigated in this work. The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the magnetic compression on rotating FRCs employing the NIMROD code [C. R. Sovinec \textit{et al.}, J. Comput. Phys. \textbf{195}, 355 (2004)], are compared with the Spencer's one-dimensional (1D) theory [R. L. Spencer \textit{et al.}, Phys. Fluids \textbf{26}, 1564 (1983)] for a wide range of initial flow speeds and profiles. The toroidal flow can influence the scalings directly through the alteration of the compressional work as also evidenced in the 1D adiabatic model, and indirectly by reshaping the initial equilibrium. However, in comparison to the static initial FRC equilibrium cases, the pressure and the radius scalings remain invariant for the magnetic compression ratio $B_{w2}/B_{w1}$ up to 6 in presence of the initial equilibrium flow, suggesting a broader applicable regime of the Spencer scaling law for FRC magnetic compression. The invariant scaling has been proven a natural consequence of the conservation of angular momentum of both fluid and magnetic field during the dynamic compression process.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Alpha Particles on Thermal Confinement in JET D-T Plasmas through Global GENE-Tango Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of the global, electromagnetic gyrokinetic GENE code interfaced with the transport Tango solver is exploited to address the impact of fusion alpha particles (in their dual role of fast particles and heating source) on plasma profiles and performance at JET in the discharges with the highest quasi-stationary peak fusion power during the DTE2 experimental campaigns. Employing radially global nonlinear electromagnetic GENE-Tango simulations, we compare results with/without alpha particles and alpha heating. Our findings reveal that alpha particles have a negligible impact on turbulent transport, with GENE-Tango converging to similar plasma profiles regardless of their inclusion as a kinetic species in GENE. On the other hand, alpha heating is found to contribute to the peaking of the electron temperature profiles, leading to a 1keV drop on the on-axis electron temperature when alpha heating is neglected in Tango. The minimal impact of alpha particles on turbulent transport in this JET discharge - despite this being the shot with the highest fusion output - is attributed to the low content of fusion alpha in this discharge. To assess the potential impact of alpha particles on turbulent transport in regimes with higher alpha particle density, as expected in ITER and fusion reactors, we artificially increased the alpha particle concentration to levels expected for ITER. By performing global nonlinear GENE standalone simulations, we found that increasing the alpha particle density beyond five times the nominal value lead to significant overall turbulence destabilization.</description>

      <title>Increased accuracy and signal-to-noise ratio through recent improvements in Infra-Red Video Bolometer fabrication and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Infra-Red Video Bolometer (IRVB) is a diagnostic equipped with an infra-red camera that measures the total radiated power in thousands of LOSs within a large field of view (FOV). Recently validated in MAST-U, it offers a high spatial resolution map of the radiated power in the divertor region, where large gradients are expected. The IRVB's sensing element comprises a thin layer of high Z absorbing material, typically Platinum, usually coated with Carbon to reduce reflections. It is here explored the possibility of using a relatively inert material like Titanium, that can be produced in layers up to 1mum compared to 2.5mum for Pt, and then coat it with Pt of the desired thickness (0.3mum per side here) and Carbon. This leads to a higher temperature signal (2 to 3 times), and better spatial resolution (about 4 times), resulting in higher accuracy in the measured power. This assembly is also expected to improve foil uniformity, as the Pt layer is obtained via deposition rather than mechanical processes. Given its multi-material composition, measuring the thermal properties of the foil assembly is vital. Various methods using a calibrated laser as a heat source have been developed, analysing the temperature profile shape or fitting the calculated laser power for different intensities and frequencies. It is here presented a simpler approach, that relies on analysing the separate components of the foil heat equation for a single laser exposure in a given area. This can then be iterated over the entire foil to capture local deviations.</description>

      <title>Ion Energy Tuning for Enhanced sp3 Carbon Fraction in Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Beam Deposited Diamond-Like Carbon Coatings: a Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel high-energy electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion beam deposition (IBD) technique was used to fabricate DLC films at different ion beam energies. The ratios of sp2/sp3 bonding in the DLC coatings were determined by Raman spectroscopy and XPS, with the confirmation of being hydrogen-free due to the lack of photoluminescence (PL) background in the Raman spectra. The results indicate that the sp3 percentage ranges from 45% - 85% for the ECR-IBD fabricated DLC films in this study. Monte-Carlo based SRIM simulation was used to extract the energy and angular distribution of the sputtered particles from the carbon target and correlate it to the highest sp3 fraction in the manufactured ECR-IBD DLCs. This study demonstrates a method of depositing DLC thin films under ambient conditions (room temperature with no post-annealing or additional bias voltage applied) which produces high-sp3 coatings (higher than those traditionally reported for other sputtering methods) suitable for applications where high quality DLC coatings are required.</description>

      <title>Transition from decaying to decayless kink oscillations of solar coronal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition of an impulsively excited kink oscillation of a solar coronal loop to an oscillation with a stationary amplitude, i.e., the damping pattern, is determined using the low-dimensional self-oscillation model. In the model, the decayless kink oscillations are sustained by the interaction of the oscillating loop with an external quasi-steady flow. The analytical solution is based on the assumption that the combined effect of the effective dissipation, for example, by resonant absorption, and interaction with an external flow, is weak. The effect is characterised by a dimensionless coupling parameter. The damping pattern is found to depend upon the initial amplitude and the coupling parameter. The approximate expression shows a good agreement with a numerical solution of the self-oscillation equation. The plausibility of the established damping pattern is demonstrated by an observational example. Notably, the damping pattern is not exponential, and the characteristic decay time is different from the time determined by the traditionally used exponential damping fit. Implications of this finding for seismology of the solar coronal plasmas are discussed. In particular, it is suggested that a very rapid, in less than the oscillation period, decay of the oscillation to the stationary level, achieved for larger values of the coupling parameter, can explain the relative rareness of the kink oscillation events.</description>

      <title>Progress in Electron Energy Modeling for Hypersonic Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel formulation of the electron energy relaxation terms is presented here, which is applicable to high-speed plasma flows and discharges wherein the electron temperature could be higher or lower than the gas temperature. It is demonstrated that the electron energy losses due to inelastic collisions can be expressed as a function of only two species-dependent parameters: the reduced electric field and the reduced electron mobility. This formulation is advantageous over previous ones, being simpler to implement and more accurate when experimental data of the reduced electric field and reduced mobility are available. Curve fits to empirical data of these two properties are outlined here for all important air molecular species. The approach accounts for all inelastic electron energy relaxation processes without needing individual cross-sections or rates, reducing potential errors associated with independently handling each process. Several test cases are presented to validate the proposed electron energy source terms including hypersonic plasma flows for which the electron temperature is less than the gas temperature, as well as discharges in which the electron temperature reaches values in excess of 30 eV. In all cases, the agreement with experimental data is observed to be very good to excellent, significantly surpassing prior electron energy models for high-speed flows.</description>

      <title>Lightwave-controlled relativistic plasma mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on attosecond-scale control of high-harmonic and electron emission from plasma mirrors driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle lightwaves at kHz repetition rate. By controlling the waveform of the intense light transient, we reproducibly form a sub-cycle temporal intensity gate at the plasma mirror surface, leading to the observation of extreme ultraviolet spectral continua, characteristic of isolated attosecond pulse generation. We also observe the correlated emission of a waveform-dependent relativistic electron beam, paving the way towards fully lightwave-controlled dynamics of relativistic plasma mirrors.</description>
