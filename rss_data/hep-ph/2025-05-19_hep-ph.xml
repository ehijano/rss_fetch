      <title>Jet production at electron-positron colliders at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of antenna subtraction at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD by computing fully differential predictions for two-jet production at electron-positron colliders. We illustrate the structure of the infrared counterterms and provide results for the N$^3$LO correction to the two-jet production rate and to the leading-jet energy. Our work constitutes the first direct calculation of jet production at electron-positron colliders at N$^3$LO and represents the first step in tackling arbitrary processes with jets at this perturbative order.</description>

      <title>Unearthing large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the Large Hadron Collider's Run 3 in progress, the 125 GeV Higgs boson couplings are being examined in greater detail, while searching for additional scalars. Multi-Higgs frameworks allow Higgs couplings to significantly deviate from Standard Model values, enabling indirect probes of extra scalars. We consider the possibility of large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings in the softly-broken Z2xZ2' three-Higgs doublet model with CP violating coefficients. To explore the parameter space of the model, we employ a Machine Learning algorithm that significantly enhances sampling efficiency. Using it, we find new regions of parameter space and observable consequences, not found with previous techniques. This method leverages an Evolutionary Strategy to quickly converge towards valid regions with an additional Novelty Reward mechanism. We use this model as a prototype to illustrate the potential of the new techniques, applicable to any Physics Beyond the Standard Model scenario.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Magnetogenesis at the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous CP violation during the electroweak phase transition can induce a twisting of the magnetic field configuration of Standard Model dumbbells, resulting in sizable intergalactic magnetic fields and a small baryon asymmetry, in agreement with observations. We demonstrate this by coupling the electroweak gauge group of the Standard Model to an axion-like particle with a non-vanishing velocity. Studying the resulting monopole, string and dumbbell configurations, we conclude that the helicity fraction of the magnetic fields generated at the electroweak phase transition is roughly given by the dimensionless axion velocity.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Treating baryons as quark + interacting-diquark bound states, a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) is used to deliver an extensive, coherent set of predictions for $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryon unpolarised and polarised distribution functions (DFs) -- valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea -- and compare them with those of a like-structured nucleon. $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryons are strangeness negative-one isospin partners within the SU$(3)$-flavour baryon octet. This makes such structural comparisons significant. The study reveals impacts of diquark correlations and SU$(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking on $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^0$ structure functions, some of which are significant. For instance, were it not for the presence of axialvector diquarks in the $\Sigma^0$ at the hadron scale, the $s$ quark could carry none of the $\Sigma^0$ spin. The discussion canvasses issues that include helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the sign and size of polarised gluon DFs; and the origin and decomposition of baryon spins. Interpreted judiciously, the SCI analysis delivers an insightful explanation of baryon structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Prescription for $t$-channel Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $t$-channel singularity is a divergence in the scattering amplitude which occurs when a stable particle propagating in $t$-channel scattering process becomes an on-shell state. Such situations appear either in the system of collider experiments or in the context of the cosmological particle production. No scheme which is generally applicable is known. In this work, we propose a new formulation to identify and remove the source of the divergence. The scheme is fully analytical and various applications can be expected. This work provides a valuable tool in this research field.</description>

      <title>Angular structure of Drell-Yan reaction in the TMD factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study angular distributions in the Drell-Yan process using an extended transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework that includes kinematic power corrections. This approach allows the description of observables previously considered power-suppressed. The results show good agreement with experimental data and provide the first LHC-based indication of the Boer-Mulders function, highlighting the value of power corrections in TMD phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Three-Quark Potentials (Part II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Depolarization of synchrotron radiation of a relativistic electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study on the radiative self-polarization of a high-energy electron beam propagating perpendicular to a strong magnetic field. Recently, a similar setup has been proposed as a source of polarized electron and photon beams. We focus on the dependence of electron and radiation polarization on the dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon$, which is proportional to the product of electron energy and magnetic field strength. The numerical solution of the balance equation shows that the resulting electron beam polarization increases rapidly as a function of $\varepsilon$ for $\varepsilon \ll 1$ and saturates at a value of approximately $-0.8$. If $\varepsilon \gg 1$, the rate of self-polarization decreases significantly. At the same time, a substantial or nearly complete depolarization of synchrotron radiation is observed, particularly for an electron beam with spins initially aligned parallel to the field.</description>

      <title>Spin effect in vacuum pair production under two-color rotating electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the spin effect on the vacuum pair production by Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism under two-color counter-rotating electric fields. We primarily studied the combined effects of the field asymmetry, time delay, and frequency chirp on the particle momentum spectrum with and without considering the spin effect. We have observed that the vacuum pair production process demonstrates spin dependence even in a pure electric field and is sensitive to variations in the field parameters. The results indicate that the spin-dependent momentum spectrum exhibited distinct outcomes for various asymmetric fields with different chirp values and time delay. For an extended asymmetric field with large chirp and time delay, the particle number density can be increased by more than six orders of magnitude. The spin-up and spin-down particles are approximately comparable for a symmetric field with a small-frequency chirp and are dominated by the spin-up particles for a larger chirp. However, in the case of an asymmetric field, the increase in field asymmetry and the chirp parameter lead to a reversal of the spin asymmetry degree. For a shortened asymmetric electric field with a large-frequency chirp, the number of spin-up particles increases, leading to a spin asymmetry degree of $98.62\%$. Conversely, in an extended asymmetric field, the number of spin-down particles increases significantly, which corresponds to a spin asymmetry degree of $99.94\%$.</description>

      <title>Inferring correlated distributions: boosted top jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the understanding of signal and background distributions in signal-region is a valuable key to enhance any analysis in collider physics. This is usually a difficult task because -- among others -- signal and backgrounds are hard to discriminate in signal-region, simulations may reach a limit of reliability if they need to model non-perturbative QCD, and distributions are multi-dimensional and many times may be correlated within each class. Bayesian density estimation is a technique that leverages prior knowledge and data correlations to effectively extract information from data in signal-region. In this work we extend previous works on data-driven mixture models for meaningful unsupervised signal extraction in collider physics to incorporate correlations between features. Using a standard dataset of top and QCD jets, we show how simulators, despite having an expected bias, can be used to inject sufficient inductive nuance into an inference model in terms of priors to then be corrected by data and estimate the true correlated distributions between features within each class. We compare the model with and without correlations to show how the signal extraction is sensitive to their inclusion and we quantify the improvement due to the inclusion of correlations using both supervised and unsupervised metrics.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in Hadronic $B$ Decays: an Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, $B\to PP$ decays ($B = \{B^0, B^+, B_s^0\}$, $P = \{ \pi, K \}$) were analyzed under the assumption of flavor SU(3) symmetry (SU(3)$_F$). Although the individual fits to $\Delta S=0$ or $\Delta S=1$ decays are good, it was found that the combined fit is very poor: there is a $3.6\sigma$ disagreement with the SU(3)$_F$ limit of the standard model (SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$). One can remove this discrepancy by adding SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects, but 1000% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is required. In this paper, we extend this analysis to include decays in which there is an $\eta$ and/or $\eta'$ meson in the final state. We now find that the combined fit exhibits a $4.1\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$, and 1000% SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects are still required to explain the data. These results are rigorous, group-theoretically -- no theoretical assumptions have been made. But when one adds some theoretical input motivated by QCD factorization, the discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$ grows to $4.9\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Gauged $\tau$-lepton chiral currents and $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of theories with a $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry associated with leptonic chiral currents. The low-energy effective field theory includes a light spin-$1$ boson coupled to the electroweak gauge sector via a Wess-Zumino term, which ensures anomaly cancellation in the infrared. As a concrete application, we show that a light vector boson with mass $m_X \simeq 2.1\,\text{GeV}$, coupled to a $\tau$-lepton chiral current, can readily account for the recent $3\sigma$ excess observed in $B \to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ at Belle II, while remaining consistent with existing constraints from $Z \to \gamma E_{\rm miss}$ and direct searches for anomalon fields responsible for anomaly cancellation in the ultraviolet. After classifying phenomenologically viable models, we explore in greater detail two concrete realizations which give rise to distinctive phenomenological signatures, potentially accessible at future experiments at the high-energy and intensity frontiers.</description>

      <title>Probing how bright the quark-gluon plasma glows in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the spectrum of photons emitted by the quark-gluon plasma non-perturbatively remains an open computational challenge. In this letter we calculate two moments of that spectrum at a temperature $T\approx 254\,$MeV, employing lattice QCD with two flavors of $\mathrm{O}(a)$-improved Wilson fermions, without facing an inverse problem. Our central value for the difference of these two moments, which is sensitive to photon energies $\omega\gtrsim \pi T$, is lower than, but compatible with that obtained by integrating the leading-order weak-coupling photon spectrum. This study informs the $\textit{direct photon puzzle}$ in heavy-ion collision phenomenology, where it has proved difficult to simultaneously explain the yield and azimuthal anisotropy of photons not originating from final-state hadronic decays.</description>

      <title>Phantom matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations of the recent universe suggest that dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is growing with time, departing from a cosmological constant for which $w=-1$. Standard quintessence models allow for a varying $w\geq-1$, but observations report that a phantom regime, $w&lt;-1$, is quickly reached in the past. Often discarded because of uncertainties or parametrisation, we rather propose here to embrace the reality of this phantom regime. We revisit an elegant mechanism that accounts for it, thanks to a coupling of quintessence field(s) to matter (and possibly radiation). We show that this allows for steep scalar potentials, and illustrate this with string-inspired models, where $V=V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \varphi}$ and $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$. Those provide solutions in very good agreement with observations, including the phantom regime. We then discuss poles that can appear in $w$, making it diverge at recent times ($z\leq 4$), and that could be detected by observations. We finally comment on an Early Dark Energy-like feature, that systematically appears for free from the models considered, and could be of interest for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Quark Propagator at one-loop in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Refined Gribov-Zwanziger scenario is a local and renormalizable setup in which infinitesimal Gribov copies are eliminated and further non-perturbative effects are accounted for. The gluon propagator that arises from this framework fits lattice data very well in the Landau gauge. We investigate the coupling of quarks to this setting at one-loop order by computing the quark propagator. The fermionic sector is introduced by a minimal coupling and the non-perturbative effects are transmitted to the matter sector through gluonic loops which, in this case, carry information from the elimination of infinitesimal Gribov copies and the formation of condensates. We compare our findings with available lattice data both for the unquenched gluon propagator as well as for the quark propagator in the Landau gauge. Our results are comparable with those obtained in the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order. In particular, we are able to fit the unquenched gluon propagator and use the fixed parameters to predict the quark mass function and find good agreement with lattice data. However, the quark dressing function does not agree, even at a qualitative level, with lattice data in the infrared. This is agreement with the analogue computation in Curci-Ferrari model. Inspired by the developments in the Curci-Ferrari results, such a disagreement is likely to be cured by the inclusion of two-loops corrections. Finally, we compare the present minimal coupling with a non-perturbative matter coupling proposed in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger literature.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work 2305.04946, we found that supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data support the hypothesis that late time cosmic acceleration is caused by the potential energy of a scalar field descending its potential, as suggested by holographically defined models of quantum gravity. In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \approx V_0 + V_1 \phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $&gt;5 \sigma$ discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\Delta \chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z &lt; 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Gamma-ray and Neutrino Production Following from the Physics of Photon-Nucleon Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical implications of particle photoproduction interactions involving nuclei is considered here, based on the most recent empirical data on particle photoproduction interactions off protons. The implications of photoproduction with helium nuclei are also discussed and compared with gamma-p interactions. It is found that gamma-He interactions, assuming the cosmological abundance of He, produce approximately 10% of the pions as compared with gamma-p interactions. In addition to the production of pions, we also discuss the relative effect of excited nucleon decay leading to single and double pion production, as well as rho, eta, omega and K meson production and decay channels, all of which produce to neutrinos and gamma-rays. The production of mesons other than pions is found not to be significant for producing gamma-rays and neutrinos from astrophysical sources. It is further shown that, for astrophysical gamma-p interactions that lead to gamma-ray and neutrino production, the decay of the Delta(1232) resonance channel clearly dominates, all other production channels being effectively negligible.</description>

      <title>Detector Designs for Frontier Measurements in Neutrino and Collider Physics in the 21st Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last energy-frontier lepton collider, LEP, established several limits that still hold today. A key one is the counting of three light neutrino species from the invisible decay width of the Z boson. From a collider calorimetry standpoint, the missing energy is an invitation to design an experiment to directly measure the neutrino mass. We present a new type of EM spectrometer which leverages the first adiabatic invariant in magnetic gradient drift to achieve exponentially bounded resolution in a highly compact and scalable format, enabling the PTOLEMY experiment to not only measure the neutrino mass at the tritium endpoint, but one day directly detect the Cosmic Neutrino Background. Meanwhile, the next lepton collider promises to expose the Higgs self-coupling and complete the accounting of lepton universality. We present a dual-readout, segmented crystal calorimeter for future collider detectors, combining new hardware capabilities with novel AI/ML reconstruction techniques towards realizing a detector that must definitively and unambiguously surpass its predecessors. Together, these studies confront the most pressing challenges for 21st century particle physics experiments to achieve the sensitivities needed to bridge the gap between the largest and smallest scales of reality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite-curvature phase diagram of IHQCD, a bottom-up holographic model for large $N_c$ non-supersymmetric YM$_4$, is investigated. This holographic theory belongs to a class of Einstein-Dilaton theories that exhibit no scaling in the IR. We use advanced techniques from dynamical system theory to address this problem that is harder than other holographic setups. We classify all solutions where the dual theory is defined on a constant curvature manifold, both with positive and negative curvature. For general theories in this class a quantum phase transition occurs at finite curvature. For IHQCD in particular, we find that the phase transition occurs at zero curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graviton-photon conversion in the presence of stochastic magnetic fields. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields that may possess nontrivial helicity, and unpolarized gravitational waves (GWs) as the initial state, we obtain expressions for the intensity and linear/circular polarizations of GWs after propagation over a finite distance. We calculate both the expectation values and variances of these observables, and find their nontrivial dependence on the typical correlation length of the magnetic field, the propagation distance, and the photon plasma mass. Our analysis reveals that an observationally favorable frequency range with narrower variance can emerge for the intensity, while a peak structure appears in the expectation value of the circular polarization when the magnetic field has nonzero helicity. We also identify a consistency relation between the GW intensity and circular polarization.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Tensor Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD was traditionally done by calculating matrix elements in the symmetric frame. Recent advancements have significantly reduced computational costs by calculating these matrix elements in the asymmetric frame, allowing us to choose the momentum transfer to be in either the initial or final states only. The theoretical methodology requires a new parametrization of the matrix element to obtain Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which are then related to the GPDs. The formulation and implementation of this approach have already been established for the unpolarized and helicity GPDs. Building upon this idea, we extend this formulation to the four leading-twist quark transversity GPDs ($H_T$, $E_T$, $\widetilde{H}_T$, $\widetilde{E}_T$). We also present numerical results for zero skewness using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The light quark masses employed in these calculations correspond to a pion mass of about 260 MeV. Furthermore, we include a comparison between the symmetric and asymmetric frame calculations to demonstrate frame independence of the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. Analysis of the matrix elements in the asymmetric frame is performed at several values of the momentum transfer squared, $-t$, ranging from 0.17 GeV$^2$ to 2.29 GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Thermal Static Potential and Pseudo-Scalar Quarkonium Spectral Functions from 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonia, which are bound states of a heavy quark and antiquark, play a key role in probing the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The dynamics of quarkonia in the QGP are encoded in their finite-temperature spectral functions. In this work, we estimate the quarkonium spectral functions in the pseudo-scalar channel using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD with a pion mass of $320\,\text{MeV}$, at temperatures of $220\,\text{MeV}\,(1.2\,T_{pc}),\,251\,\text{MeV}\,(1.4\,T_{pc})\,\text{and}\,293\,\text{MeV}\,(1.6\,T_{pc})$. Reconstructing the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator is a well-known ill-posed problem, requiring additional physics-motivated input. We address this by smoothly matching contributions from different frequency regions of the spectral function, using appropriate physics valid for each region. The spectral function around $\omega \sim 2\,M_q$ is obtained using a non-perturbative complex potential, while for $\omega \gg 2\,M_q$ it is modeled using results from vacuum perturbation theory. Since the pseudoscalar channel does not receive a transport contribution near $\omega \sim 0$, we find that the combination of these two regions already provides a good description of the relativistic lattice pseudoscalar correlator. We observe a substantial thermal width in the $\eta_c(1S)$ state, indicating that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) is nearing dissolution at the studied temperatures. In comparison, the $\eta_b$ ground state exhibits little change and remains well-defined.</description>

Abstract: We classify ``truly confining'' (t-confining) supersymmetric gauge theories, in which no center charges can be screened, and Wilson loops in the fundamental representation are therefore expected to exhibit an area law. In all cases, we identify the condensation of certain ``magnetic'' operators. Many of them have more than three branches, and one with vanishing superpotential, a phenomenon not previously observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a local, diff-invariant quantum effective action for gravity that captures the trace anomaly via a counter-term. We discuss why this counter-term is the most significant among infinitely many possible ones, and show how the counter-term leads to a scattering amplitude that is strongly coupled at arbitrarily low energies. We show how the introduction of a new sector with spontaneously broken scale invariance removes the strong coupling problem, and discuss some physical consequences due to the new sector. Three Appendices summarize quantum effective actions -- highlighting connections between their local, and seemingly non-local formulations -- for the scale anomaly in 4D QED, for the axial anomaly in 2D QED, and for the scale anomaly in a 2D sigma model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudoscalar and axial neutral and charged pion-constituent quark coupling constants are investigated with nondegenerate quark masses in different kinematical points, off shell and on shell pions and constituent quarks. By considering a large quark mass expansion of a quark determinant in the presence of local pion field and of constituent quark background currents, gluonic effects are considered by means of an effective gluon propagator that dresses quark currents. For the neutral pion, mixing effects are introduced by means of the pion mixing to states $P_0$ and $P_8$, that give rise to the $\pi^0-\eta-\eta'$ meson mixing, and mixing of quark currents via corresponding mixing interactions. The relative behavior of charged and neutral pion coupling constants to quarks may be nearly the same - in the framework of the constituent quark model - as the pion-nucleon coupling constants if mixings are introduced. A very small pion coupling to strange quark current is also obtained. The dependence of the positive and negative pion-constituent quark coupling constant on the non-degeneracy of quark masses, for emission and absorption processes, is identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of neutrino oscillations and masses provides strong motivation to extend the Standard Model by including right-handed neutrinos, which lead to heavy neutrino states that could exist at the electroweak scale. These states may also be influenced by new high-scale, weakly interacting physics. Incorporating right-handed neutrinos into an effective field theory framework -- the $\nu$SMEFT -- offers a systematic approach to study the phenomenology of heavy neutrinos in current and upcoming experiments. In this work, we present the first prospective 95\% exclusion plots achievable at a future lepton collider operating at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=0.5 ~\rm{TeV}$ for what we term the agnostic $\nu$SMEFT scenario. This study focuses on the high-mass regime where the heavy neutrino $N$ decays promptly into leptons and jets. Specifically, we analyze the processes $e^+e^- \to \nu N \to \nu \mu^{-} \mu^{+} \nu$ and $e^+e^- \to \nu N \to \nu \mu^{-} \mathrm{j} \mathrm{j}$, deriving the exclusion regions in the $\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda^2}$ vs. $m_N$ parameter space. When compared to prospective limits for the LHeC, we find that the semi-leptonic process with final jets in a lepton collider offers the greatest sensitivity, even with a straightforward cut-based analysis. The expected bounds are as stringent as those considered in recent studies for the low-mass regime where the $N$ may be long-lived and detectable via displaced decay searches, both at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of solar neutrinos confirmed that the inner workings of the Sun generally match our theoretical understanding of the fusion process. Solar neutrinos have also played a role in discovering that neutrinos have mass and that they oscillate. We combine the latest solar neutrino data along with other oscillation data from reactors to determine the Sun's density profile. We derive constraints given the current data and show the anticipated improvements with more reactor neutrino data from JUNO constraining the true oscillation parameters and more solar neutrino data from DUNE which should provide a crucial measurement of $hep$ neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Vector-like tops from first generation quarks: the role of width and coupling chiralities in same-charge production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tension the scope of the $q\bar q, gg\to T \bar T$ production process against that of the same-charge $uu\to TT$ one in searching for Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) with electromagnetic charge $+2/3$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The study is conducted by considering a simplified model in which such new states couple exclusively to Standard Model quarks of the first generation through $W^\pm, Z$ and $H$ currents. We consider both left-handed or right-handed dominant chiralities, representative of $SU(2)_L$ singlets or doublets, and the total widths are allowed to reach large values relatively to the VLQ masses. By deconstructing the signal into all its components, we assess current and projected constraints, emphasize the role of interference terms and isolate peculiar features which can be used for dedicated searches at the LHC or future colliders.</description>

      <title>Why $w \ne -1$? Anthropic Selection in a $\Lambda$ + Axion Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dark energy model composed of a bare negative cosmological constant and a single ultra-light axion, motivated by the string axiverse. Assuming that intelligent observers arise and observe, as in our universe, the onset of dark-energy-driven acceleration following matter domination, and that this acceleration persists to the present, we derive nontrivial constraints on both the axion mass and the bare cosmological constant. The axion mass is bounded from above to avoid fine-tuning of the initial misalignment angle near the hilltop, and from below because too light axions cannot achieve accelerated expansion due to their limited energy budget. As a result, the anthropically allowed axion mass range typically lies around $m = \mathcal{O}(10)\, H_0$ for a decay constant close to the Planck scale, where $H_0$ is the observed value of the Hubble constant. In this framework, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w_0$ generically deviates from $-1$ by $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$, providing a natural explanation for why $w \ne -1$ may be expected. We also find that, for a decay constant slightly smaller than the Planck scale, the peak value of dark energy density is significantly smaller than the anthropic bound on the cosmological constant and can be close to the observed value. These outcomes are intriguingly consistent with recent DESI hints of time-varying dark energy, and offer a compelling anthropic explanation within the $\Lambda$ + axion framework.</description>

Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Spin Particles, On Shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study on-shell scattering amplitudes for continuous-spin particles (CSPs). Poincar\'e invariance, little-group $ISO(2)$ covariance, analyticity, and on-shell factorisation (unitarity) impose stringent conditions on these amplitudes. We solve them by realizing a non-trivial representation for all little-group generators on the space of functions of bi-spinors. The three-point amplitudes are uniquely determined by matching their high-energy limit to that of definite-helicity (ordinary) massless particles. Four-point amplitudes are then bootstrapped using consistency conditions, allowing us to analyze the theory in a very transparent way, without relying on any off-shell Lagrangian formulation. We present several examples that highlight the main features of the resulting scattering amplitudes. We discuss CSP's amplitudes as a new infrared deformation of ordinary massless amplitudes, which is controlled by the scale of the Pauli-Lubanski vector squared, as opposed to the familiar mass deformation. Finally, we explore under which conditions it is possible to relax some assumptions, such as strict on-shell factorisation, analyticity, or others. In particular, we also investigate how continuous-spin particles may couple to gravity and electromagnetism, in a loose version of $S$-matrix principles.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing neutrinoless double beta decay event kinematics in a xenon gas detector with vertex tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered, the next natural step would be understanding the lepton number violating physics responsible for it. Several alternatives exist beyond the exchange of light neutrinos. Some of these mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring phase-space observables, namely the opening angle $\cos\theta$ among the two decay electrons, and the electron energy spectra, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In this work, we study the statistical accuracy and precision in measuring these kinematic observables in a future xenon gas detector with the added capability to precisely locate the decay vertex. For realistic detector conditions (a gas pressure of 10 bar and spatial resolution of 4 mm), we find that the average $\overline{\cos\theta}$ and $\overline{T_1}$ values can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.19 and 110 keV, respectively, assuming that only 10 neutrinoless double beta decay events are detected.</description>

      <title>Hadron Production in Open-charm Meson Pair at $e^+e^-$ Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics is a well-established theoretical framework, yet there remain several unresolved issues that warrant further experimental and theoretical exploration. In the realm of quark physics, these include understanding the nature of quark confinement and elucidating the mechanism linking quarks and gluons to strongly interacting particles within the standard model theory, which may offer insights into underlying physics mechanisms. These inquiries can be addressed through the study of hadron production in open-charm meson pair final states at $e^+e^-$ annihilations utilizing the capabilities of BABAR, Belle, BESIII, and CLEO-c experiments, which have yielded valuable insights into non-standard hadrons over recent decades. This review examines the contributions of $e^+e^-$ colliders from BABAR, Belle, BESIII, and CLEO-c experiments to such studies and discusses future prospects for $e^+e^-$ collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Cuscuton Bounce Beyond the Linear Regime: Bispectrum and Strong Coupling Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cuscuton Gravity is characterized as a scalar field that can be added to general relativity without introducing any new dynamical degrees of freedom on a cosmological background. Yet, it modifies gravity such that spacetime singularities can be avoided. This has led to the Cuscuton bounce, a nonsingular cosmology that has been shown to be linearly stable, which is a rare feat. Upon introducing mechanisms known to generate a near-scale-invariant power spectrum of isocurvature perturbations in the prebounce contracting phase, we perform an extensive linear analysis of all scalar perturbations as they evolve through the Cuscuton bounce, both analytically and numerically. Then, after deriving the third-order perturbed action for our theory, we compare the magnitude of its terms (on shell) to those in the second-order action. We show that perturbativity is maintained in the infrared throughout the evolution, including through the bounce. In the ultraviolet, we show that a hierarchy of scales is maintained, with the strong coupling scale well above the relevant background energy scale at all times. We reconfirm these results by computing the three-point functions in various limits and demonstrate that the models do not have any strong coupling problems and furthermore that there is negligible non-Gaussianities on observable scales. Consequently, the primary potential source of observable non-Gaussianities may only arise from the conversion of isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations. The whole scenario is thus a robust, stable, weakly coupled nonsingular cosmological model, consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of a (3+1)D hybrid approach with initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to apply statistical learning, specifically Bayesian inference, to the (3+1)D SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid model using initial conditions generated by the SMASH transport code itself, with the objective of constraining model parameters and gaining deeper insight on the temperature and baryochemical potential dependence of both the shear and the bulk viscosity. This study is performed in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH and the (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. A Bayesian framework is employed, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore the parameter space. The analysis compares model predictions against experimental observables, including particle yields, momentum and flow coefficients both at midrapidity as well as in forward and backward direction. We find that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid framework, using hadronic initial conditions for Au+Au collisions at different beam energies, can reproduce a variety of experimental observables at midrapidity and forward/backward rapidities. Notably, the preferred posterior distribution suggests a near-vanishing specific shear viscosity in the high-temperature QGP phase, combined with moderate-to-large bulk viscosity around the phase transition region, although the constraints on baryochemical potential dependence are weak. Our findings reveal that a hadronic initial condition constrains the evolution more strictly at intermediate energies, making parameters such as the hydrodynamic onset time highly sensitive. Intriguingly, the extracted shear viscosity differs substantially from previous Bayesian analyses, motivating further systematic studies with higher-statistics data sets and refined modeling assumptions.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a 1+1D toy model of particle space-time evolution. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energies. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single charm-anticharm quark pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei and the quark-gluon plasma hadronisation paradox. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Confining Quantum Chromodynamics Model for 3-Quark Baryons, New Mass Source, `Proton Spin Crisis' Solution and Idealized Quark-Lepton Mass Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a model for the relativistic bound states of 3-quark baryons based on confining quantum chromoynamics (QCD) with general Yang-Mills symmetry. The model postulates that 3-quark states are formed by consecutive 2-body collisions. For a proton, d and u quarks get together first, and then they capture another u quark so that the d quark is at the core to form a stable proton state with intergral electric charge. The two u quarks form a quantum spheric shell and move in a confining potential $C(r)= Q' r$ of the core d quark. The confining potential $C(r)$ is a static solution of new `phase' fields satisfying the fourth-order equation based on general Yang-Mills symmetry. The two u quarks with the confining linear potentials $C(r)$ in the spherical shell can produce an effective quark Hooke potential $V_{qH}(r)=Qr^2 + V_o$ for the d quark at the core, where Q and $Q'$ are not independent. The proton mass is assumed to be approximately given by
  $ E(d) + 2E(u)$, which can be obtained analytically from Dirac Hamiltonians involving $V_{qH}(r)$ and $C(r)$ for d and two u quarks respectively. The model gives a reasonable understanding of roughly 120 baryon masses based on two different coupling constants and one free parameter $V_o$ for sub-spectra specfied by $J^P$. These results are roughly within 20\% in percent deviation, which appears to be independent of the assumption of color charges. The confining QCD model also gives the neutron-proton mass difference $\approx 0.6 MeV$.
  We propose an experimental test of the proton structure.</description>

      <title>Probing the dimuon channel of a Z' boson at the HL-LHC using multivariate analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming upgrade of the existing LHC facility at CERN is known as the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). It is designed to extend its physics reach by substantially increasing the integrated luminosity. It will enable more precise measurements of the Standard Model (SM) and improve sensitivity to rare events and possible new physics signatures. This study adopts a multivariate analysis (MVA) approach to effectively discriminate the dark Higgs (DH) signal against the dominant SM background. The analysis targets the leptonic decay mode of the $Z'$ boson, focusing on the dimuon final state at $\sqrt{s} = 14,\text{TeV}$ and $3000,\text{fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity corresponding to the HL-LHC. The DH signal is examined using the Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA), employing and comparing the performance of three classifiers: Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Likelihood estimators.</description>
