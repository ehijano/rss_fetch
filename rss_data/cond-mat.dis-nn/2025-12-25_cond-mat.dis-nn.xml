      <title>Analytical quantification of strongly disordered discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an analytical framework to calculate the values of key observables in a strongly disordered discrete time crystal (DTC) without fitting parameter. The perturbatively obtained closed-form formulae show quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of inverse participation ratios for eigenstate localization in Fock space, Edwards-Anderson parameters for spin-glass orders, mutual information for long-range entanglement, and the steady-state amplitudes of autocorrelators for period-doubled oscillations. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that eigenstate resonances render the scaling for the deviation of physical observables from their unperturbed values as $O(\lambda)$, in contrast to non-resonant situations with suppressed deviation $O(\lambda^2)$. Our scheme is based on the resolvent perturbation method that can directly prescribe arbitrarily higher-order corrections without iterations. With such advantages, we analytically prove that quasienergy corrections for pairwise cat eigenstates are identical up to order $O(\lambda^{(L/n_{\text{op}})-1})$, where perturbations of strength $\lambda$ involve at most $n_{\text{op}}$-spin terms. Such spectral pairing deviations quantify the DTC lifetime as $\tau_* \sim (1/\lambda)^{L/n_{\text{op}}}$. Our analytical scheme applies to generic DTC models with dominant Ising interaction and a given number of qubits, which allows for independent quantification of physical observables beyond the system size accessible to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics for organic mixed conductors: phase transitions in a lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic mixed conductors (OMCs) represent a promising class of materials for applications in bioelectronics, physical computing, and thermoelectrics. Rather unparalleled, OMCs feature dynamics spanning multiple length and time scales, involving an intricate coupling between electronic, ionic, and mass transport. These characteristics set them notably apart from traditional semiconductors and hinder the description by conventional semiconductor theory. In this work, we approach the charge carrier modulation of OMCs using statistical mechanics. We discuss OMCs from a first-principles perspective and contrast them with established semiconductor materials, highlighting key differences in their collective charge carrier dynamics. This motivates our toy model describing OMCs as a lattice gas, which we analyze within the grand canonical ensemble. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition analogous to a classical vapor$\unicode{x2013}$liquid transition, governed by temperature and chemical potential. In doing so, it explains the formation of distinct low- and high-density carrier phases $\unicode{x2013}$ a mesoscale phenomenon recently observed experimentally. It also demonstrates how metastability near the phase boundary can give rise to history-dependent characteristics in device operation, a similarly well-reported effect in OMC transistors. This work is intended as a simple motivation for studying OMCs through the lens of statistical mechanics, offering a more natural description than traditional semiconductor models developed for materials of fundamentally distinct character.</description>

      <title>Inter-defect interactions, oxygen-vacancy distribution, and oxidation in acceptor-doped ABO3 perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of inter-defect interaction on the defect thermodynamics, local structure, and oxidation of acceptor-doped wide-gap ABO3 perovskites are explored using the developed statistical theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced resonant acceleration of a charge in an intermittent magnetic field: an exact solution for ergodic and non-ergodic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations. The associated induced electric field gives rise to non-trivial dynamical regimes. In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we shows, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases. Even rare, abrupt field reversal are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion. We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Spin Glasses: Disorder, Frustration, and Nonequilibrium Complexity</title>

Abstract: Spin glasses occupy a unique place in condensed matter: they freeze collectively while remaining struc-turally disordered, and they exhibit slow, history-dependent dynamics that reflect an exceptionally rug-ged free-energy landscape. This review provides an integrated account of spin-glass physics, emphasiz-ing how microscopic ingredients (quenched randomness, frustration, competing exchange interactions, and random fields) conspire to produce macroscopic glassiness. We begin with the canonical Edwards-Anderson and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick formulations to introduce the central theoretical ideas that recur across the literature: extensive degeneracy, metastability, and the emergence of long relaxation times that manifest as aging, memory, and rejuvenation under standard experimental protocols. We then summarize the principal routes used to characterize spin-glass freezing, combining thermodynamic signatures with dynamical probes that reveal the separation of timescales and the sensitivity to thermal and magnetic histories. Building on these foundations, we draw connections across experimental material classes (me-tallic alloys, insulating oxides, and geometrically frustrated systems) by emphasizing how intrinsic ver-sus induced disorder and competing interaction networks shape the observed phenomenology. Recent advances in reentrant and room-temperature spin-glass materials are highlighted as a rapidly developing direction that tests the limits of established paradigms and motivates new materials-driven questions. The review concludes by connecting modern computational developments, including machine-learning phase identification and neural-network analogies, to longstanding challenges in classification, univer-sality, and out-of-equilibrium behavior, and by outlining emerging opportunities at the boundary between classical and quantum spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using an annealing-based approach involves solving generalized eigenvalue problems. Discretizing a PDE yields a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be formulated as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed into an optimization problem with an objective function given by a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm requires iterative computations. However, it enables efficient annealing-based computation of eigenvectors to arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables. Investigations using simulated annealing demonstrate how the number of iterations scales with system size and annealing time. Computational performance depends on system size, annealing time, and problem characteristics.</description>
