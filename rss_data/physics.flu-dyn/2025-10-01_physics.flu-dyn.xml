      <title>Optimized Fish Locomotion using Design-by-Morphing and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a computational framework for optimizing undulatory swimming profiles using a combination of design-by-morphing and Bayesian optimization strategies. The body deformation is expressed as a linear combination of five baseline bio-inspired profiles, including two unconventional shapes to enhance diversity in the design space. The optimization objective is to maximize propulsive efficiency over a wide range of frequency-wavelength combinations. The Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian formulation is employed to simulate the unsteady flow around two-dimensional undulating swimmers. The optimized profile achieves a significantly improved efficiency of 82.4\%, while the second- and third-best profiles achieve efficiencies of 51.8\% and 42.8\%, respectively, outperforming the benchmark anguilliform and carangiform profiles by leveraging advantageous surface stress distributions and effective energy recovery mechanisms. A detailed force decomposition reveals that the optimal swimmer minimizes resistive drag and maximizes constructive work contributions, particularly in the anterior and posterior body regions. Spatial and temporal work decomposition indicates a strategic redistribution of input and recovered energy, enhancing performance while reducing energetic cost. The wake topology associated with the optimized swimmer exhibits organized and coherent vortex structures, reflecting superior fluid-structure interaction characteristics compared to conventional profiles. These findings demonstrate that morphing-based parametric design, when guided by surrogate-assisted optimization, offers a powerful framework for discovering energetically efficient swimming gaits, with significant implications for the design of autonomous underwater propulsion systems and the broader field of bio-inspired locomotion.</description>

      <title>Consistent control of drying rates of solution thin films on wafer-sized substrates by dynamic air-knife drying with optimal trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work tackles the problem of achieving consistent drying rates of a solution film deposited on a $20\,\rm{cm}$-wide substrate ($\approx $ silicon-wafer size) that is driven under a narrow air flow ejected by a slot nozzle (or "air knife"). The main prerequisite of the work is that the drying rate of the solution film is highly decisive for a certain performance indicator of the deposited film at a particular, critical concentration $c_{\rm crit.}$. Empirically, this concentration can be associated with the visual observation of "the drying front" as, for the example of hybrid perovskite thin films, caused by the onset of a crystallization process. As a main result, a set of equations for achieving consistent drying rates, $\dot{d}_{\rm crit.}$, at critical concentration is presented that is solved by a simple two-staged least-squares gradient decent. From the resulting velocity vector, an optimal trajectory of the air knife, $\hat{x}(t)$, depending on the initial wet film thickness distribution over the substrate is derived. It is demonstrated that scenarios where the wet film thickness increases along the movement direction of the air knife have a consistent set of equations. Wet thin films that do not obey this constraint, as in the demonstrated scenarios with convex and concave shapes of wet film thickness over the substrate area, cannot always be dried in a fully consistent way by optimizing the air-knife trajectory alone. However, with the presented methods, optimal trajectories can still be derived that enable more homogeneous drying results.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of anomalous deterministic transport in steady plane viscous flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider transport of passive particles in steady laminar plane flows of incompressible viscous fluids. While drifting along the streamlines, the particles experience alternating accelerations and slowdowns. For an ensemble of particles, recurring slow passages across the vicinities of stagnation points affect the transport and result in the unbounded growth of the ensemble variance. This growth is logarithmic in case of generic stagnation points and has a power-law character in the presence of degeneracies. We interrelate quantitative characteristics of the variance growth with the singularities of the passage time and derive explicit estimates for the transport exponents.</description>

      <title>On the wall-normal velocity variance in canonical wall-bounded turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variance and spectra of wall-normal velocities are investigated for direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow in a channel, pipe, and zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) boundary layer, across a decade of wall friction Reynolds numbers. Spectra along the spanwise wavenumber have a pronounced peak at intermediate wavenumbers that is proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and the cube of the local shear stress throughout the bottom half of the boundary layer for all flow cases. The observed scaling with the local stress rather than the surface shear velocity $U_\tau$ accounts for differences in the ZPG wall-normal variance seen in previous studies. The scaling is attributed to the fact that wall-normal motions are predominately `active' per Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis and directly contribute to the local shear stress, while noting this hypothesis does not account for the linear decay of the total stress in enclosed flows. The Reynolds number dependence of the variance is determined from the scale separation between the spectrum peak and the dissipative cutoff, where the resulting semi-empirical fit aligns with variance values in the literature. At the high-Reynolds-number limit, the spectral peak leads to a variance between 1.45 to 1.65 times the local shear stress. This range is consistent with previous predictions relative to $U_\tau$, including for the vertical velocity in the near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer. However, universality in the exact proportional constant is precluded by relatively minor contributions from the `inactive' motions at low wavenumbers, which vary with wall-normal position and for different flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for subgrid turbulence in large-eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence governs the transport of momentum, energy, and scalars in many geophysical and engineering flows. In large-eddy simulations (LES), parameterizing subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses remains a central challenge, as unresolved physical processes strongly influence turbulent transport. Traditional SGS models, such as the Smagorinsky-type models and deep neural networks (DNNs), are deterministic and cannot capture the stochastic nature of turbulence. Despite its wide application in computer vision and natural language processing, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has not previously been applied to directly compute SGS stresses in three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers at high Reynolds numbers. Here we introduce a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to reconstruct SGS stresses from coarse-grained velocity fields in direct numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer. The DDPM consistently outperforms Smagorinsky-type models and previous deep neural networks in terms of spatial correlations and probability distributions for deviatoric stresses, and can be applied to unseen convective stability conditions and resolutions. By learning conditional distributions rather than pointwise values, this generative approach opens a new direction for SGS turbulence modeling at high Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>On the joint observability of flow fields and particle properties from Lagrangian trajectories: evidence from neural data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the joint observability of flow states and unknown particle properties from Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) data. LPT offers time-resolved, volumetric measurements of particle trajectories, but experimental tracks are spatially sparse, potentially noisy, and may be further complicated by inertial transport, raising the question of whether both Eulerian fields and particle characteristics can be reliably inferred. To address this, we develop a data assimilation framework that couples an Eulerian flow representation with Lagrangian particle models, enabling the simultaneous inference of carrier fields and particle properties under the governing equations of disperse multiphase flow. Using this approach, we establish empirical existence proofs of joint observability across three representative regimes. In a turbulent boundary layer with noisy tracer tracks (St to 0), flow states and true particle positions are jointly observable. In homogeneous isotropic turbulence seeded with inertial particles (St ~ 1-5), we demonstrate simultaneous recovery of flow states and particle diameters, showing the feasibility of implicit particle characterization. In a compressible, shock-dominated flow, we report the first joint reconstructions of velocity, pressure, density, and inertial particle properties (diameter and density), highlighting both the potential and certain limits of observability in supersonic regimes. Systematic sensitivity studies further reveal how seeding density, noise level, and Stokes number govern reconstruction accuracy, yielding practical guidelines for experimental design. Taken together, these results show that the scope of LPT could be broadened to multiphase and high-speed flows, in which tracer and measurement fidelity are limited.</description>

      <title>Absorption and reflection of inertial waves by a geostrophic vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction of inertial waves with geostrophic flow in a rapidly rotating fluid system. In accordance with experimental conditions in [1, 2], we consider inertial waves, which were excited by a source being near side boundary of the flow and enter the region where geostrophic vortex flow is present. The wave equation is derived and analyzed in the paper that describes the propagation of convergent and divergent cylindrical waves on the background of mean vortex flow, which is considered as an axisymmetric differential rotation. We show that a monochromatic wave does not exert any torque on the vortex flow in the inviscid limit until it is absorbed inside the critical layer. Among convergent waves those only are absorbed which carries angular momentum of the same sign as one's of the rotation in the vortex. Convergent waves with the opposite sign of angular momentum are just reflected from the vortex. The absorption of a wave is possible only if the vortex flow is characterized by fast enough angular velocity there. The behavior of the wave near the critical layer can be described by the well-known model where the mean flow is rectilinear shear flow. We show that the conventional wave train approximation for the short-wave limit is not applicable in the vicinity of the layer and revise it, deriving the proper equation and reformulating the conservation law of wave action. For the vicinity of critical layer, a model which accounts for the viscous dissipation is derived; viscous effects are studied for absorption both of monochromatic wave and wave train.</description>

      <title>A new Timestep Criterion for the Simulation of Immiscible Two-Phase Flow with IMPES Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an iterative IMPES solver and a novel timestep criterion for the simulation of immiscible two-phase flow involving compressible fluid phases. The novel timestep criterion uses the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition and employs numerically computed velocity derivatives to adapt the timestep size, regardless of the dominant flow characteristics. The solver combined with this timestep criterion demonstrates both efficiency and robustness across a range of flow scenarios, including pressure drop dominated and capillary dominated flows with compressible and incompressible fluid phases, without the need to adjust any numerical parameters. Furthermore, it successfully reaches the expected stationary states in a case involving discontinuous porous media parameters such as porosity, permeabilities, and capillary pressure function. Comparison with the established Coats timestep criterion reveals that our approach requires fewer time iterations while maintaining comparable accuracy on the Buckley-Leverett problem and a gravity-capillary equalization example with a known stationary state. Additionally, in an example with air compression, the new timestep criterion leads to a significantly improved non-wetting phase mass conservation compared to the Coats criterion.</description>

      <title>Kinetic closure of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann-BGK equation, paving the way towards an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in Navier-Stokes models. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor. The Chapman-Enskog analysis shows that its hydrodynamic limit converges exactly to the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach in Augmenting RANS Models Using DNS Data and DeepInsight Method on FDA Nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for turbulence modeling, applied to flow prediction in the FDA nozzle. In this study, the standard RANS equations have been modified using an implicit-explicit hybrid approach. New variables were introduced, and a solver was developed within the OpenFOAM framework, integrating a machine learning module to estimate these variables. The invariant input features were derived based on Hilbert's basis theorem, and the outputs of the machine learning model were obtained through eigenvalue-vector decomposition of the Reynolds stress tensor. Validation was performed using DNS data for turbulent flow in a square channel at various Reynolds numbers. A baseline MLP was first trained at $Re=2900$ and tested at $Re=3500$ to assess its ability to reproduce turbulence anisotropy and secondary flows. To further enhance generalization, three benchmark DNS datasets were transformed into images via the Deep-Insight method, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks. The trained Deep-Insight network demonstrated improved prediction of turbulence structures in the FDA blood nozzle, highlighting the promise of data-driven augmentation in turbulence modeling.</description>

      <title>The Cryogenic Lagrangian Exploration Module: a rotating cryostat for the study of quantum vortices in Helium II via particle seeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum vortex dynamics in HeII offers great potential for advancing quantum-fluid models. Bose-Einstein condensates, neutron stars, and even superconductors exhibit quantum vortices, whose interactions are crucial for dissipation in these systems. These vortices have quantized velocity circulation around their cores, which, in HeII, are of atomic size. They have been observed indirectly, through methods such as second sound attenuation or electron bubble imprints on photosensitive materials. Over the past twenty years, decorating cryogenic flows with particles has become a powerful approach to studying these vortices. However, recent particle visualization experiments often face challenges with stability, initial conditions, stationarity, and reproducibility. Moreover, most dynamical analyses are performed in 2D, even though many flows are inherently 3D. We constructed a rotating cryostat with optical ports on an elongated square cupola to enable 2D2C, 2D3C, and 3D3C Lagrangian and Eulerian studies of rotating HeII flow. Using this setup, individual quantum vortices have been tracked with micron-sized particles, as demonstrated by Peretti et al., Sci. Adv. 9, eadh2899 (2023). The cryostat and associated equipment -- laser, cameras, sensors, and electronics -- float on a 50 $\mu$m air cushion, allowing for precise control of the experiment's physical parameters. The performance during rotation is discussed, along with details on particle injection.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator for Interpretable and Integrable Latent Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent interpretability.</description>

      <title>Advection selects pattern in multi-stable emulsions of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (i) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (ii) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (iii) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</description>

      <title>Falling plates with leading-edge vortex shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22606v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new numerical method for thin plates falling in inviscid fluid that allows for leading-edge vortex shedding. The inclusion of leading-edge shedding restores physical dynamics to vortex-sheet models of falling bodies, and for the first time large-amplitude fluttering and tumbling are observed in inviscid simulations. Leading-edge shedding is achieved by introducing a novel quadrature rule and smoothing procedure for the Birkhoff-Rott equations. The smoothing error is controlled by a novel fencing procedure. We find a transition point between fluttering and tumbling that is consistent with previous viscous simulations and experiments, and other falling motions such as looping, autorotation are also observed as the plate density increases. The dipole street wakes behind the fluttering plates resemble those in experiments. We consider plates bent into V shapes and study the effects of density and bending angle on the qualitative falling dynamics. At small densities, increasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into fluttering, while at large densities, decreasing the bending angle stabilizes the falling motion into autorotation. In the autorotation regime, the magnitude of angular velocity increases as time cubed before it reaches a terminal angular velocity, and in the fluttering regime, the fluttering frequency scales as the $-1/2$ power of $R_1$, the plate density.</description>

      <title>High Resolution and High-Speed Live Optical Flow Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is the most widely used optical technique for measuring two-dimensional velocity fields in fluids. However, with the standard cross-correlation (CC) algorithm, improving the spatial resolution of instantaneous velocity fields and obtaining dense velocity fields in real time remains challenging. Optical Flow Velocimetry (OFV) offers a way to overcome these limitations. In this study, we demonstrate that dense velocity fields (one vector per pixel) with high spatial resolution can be obtained in real time at frequencies up to thousands of Hertz using an optical flow approach. We show that high resolution is achievable with optimized seeding, and that computational speed can be increased by choosing appropriate parameters and running on a single GPU. Using this method, 21 Mp velocity fields can be computed in real-time at 90 Hz, while 4 Mp velocity fields can be computed up to 460 Hz. These measurements enable the computation of various flow quantities in real time, during the experiment. It makes this technique perfectly suitable for many new type of experiments, from closed-loop flow control experiments based on OFV measurements, to very low frequency measurements or monitoring of the flow to find rare events. They also greatly accelerate post-processing leading to potential large time and energy gain for post-processing.</description>

      <title>Rare-event detection in a backward-facing-step flow using live optical-flow velocimetry: observation of an upstream jet burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare and extreme events in turbulent flows play a critical role in transport, mixing and transition, yet are notoriously difficult to capture experimentally. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first direct experimental detection of an upstream-directed jet burst in a backward-facing step (BFS) flow at $Re_h=2100$, using long-duration Live Optical Flow Velocimetry (L-OFV). Continuous monitoring over 1.5 h enabled a data-driven definition of extremes as rare velocity probes excursions deep into the observed distribution's tails; in practice, large negative events ($u: Z &lt; -6$, $v: Z &lt; -5$ at $(x,y) = (2h,h / 2)$, where $|Z| &gt; &gt; 0$ stands for large deviations from the mean value) triggered the live capture of surrounding velocity fields. The recording is triggered when the probes surpass the defined threshold, using live analysis of the velocity fields. The detected event features a jet-like intrusion into the recirculation region initiated by the collapse of a merged Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex and sustained by counter-rotating vortices, and is accompanied with heavy-tailed probe statistics and simultaneous amplification of fluctuating kinetic energy and enstrophy. While a single event was recorded, underscoring its rarity, the results establish L-OFV as a viable platform for rare-event detection in separated shear layers and document a previously unreported mechanism of upstream jet bursting in BFS flow.</description>

      <title>Extracting self-similarity from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying self-similarity is key to understanding and modelling a plethora of phenomena in fluid mechanics. Unfortunately, this is not always possible to perform formally in highly complex flows. We propose a methodology to extract the similarity variables of a self-similar physical process directly from data, without prior knowledge of the governing equations or boundary conditions, based on an optimization problem and symbolic regression. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of our method in five problems which have been influential in fluid mechanics research: a laminar boundary layer, Burger's equation, a turbulent wake, a collapsing cavity, and decaying turbulence. Our analysis considers datasets acquired via both numerical and wind tunnel experiments. The algorithm recovers the known self-similarity expressions in the first four problems and generates new insights on single length scale theories of homogeneous turbulence.</description>
