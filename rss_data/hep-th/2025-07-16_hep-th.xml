      <title>The Baby Universe is Fine and the CFT Knows It: On Holography for Closed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole Airy Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instantons, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why a recent attempt to compute the quenched entropy using one-eigenvalue instantons is unreliable due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.</description>

      <title>Orbit method for Quantum Corner Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of the unitary irreducible representations of symmetry groups is a cornerstone of modern quantum physics, as it provides the fundamental building blocks for constructing the Hilbert spaces of theories admitting these symmetries. In the context of gravitational theories, several arguments point towards the existence of a universal symmetry group associated with corners, whose structure is the same for every diffeomorphism-invariant theory in any dimension.
  Recently, the representations of the maximal central extension of this group in the two-dimensional case have been classified using purely algebraic techniques. In this work, we present a complementary and independent derivation based on Kirillov's orbit method.
  We study the coadjoint orbits of the group $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}}(2,\mathbb{R})\ltimes\mathbb{H}_3$, where $\mathbb{H}_3$ is the Heisenberg group of a quantum particle in one dimension. Our main result is that, despite the non-abelian nature of the normal subgroup in the semidirect product, these orbits admit a simple description. In a coordinate system associated with modified Lie algebra generators, the orbits factorize into a product of coadjoint orbits of $\mathrm{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ and $\mathbb{H}_3$. The subsequent geometric quantization of these factorized orbits successfully reproduces the known representations.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Metric Commutation Relation and Higher-derivative De Donder Gauge in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs) among the time derivatives of the metric tensor identically vanish in the higher-derivative de Donder gauge as well as the conventional de Donder gauge (or harmonic gauge) for general coordinate invariance in the manifestly covariant canonical operator formalism of quadratic gravity. These ETCRs provide us with the vanishing four-dimensional commutation relation, which implies that the metric tensor behaves as if it were not a quantum operator but a classical field. In this case, the micro-causality is valid at least for the metric tensor in an obvious manner. This fact might be a manifestation of renormalizability of quadratic gravity in case of the canonical operator formalism.</description>

      <title>Confinement in QCD: A Hybrid String Model with Vortex Corrections and Entanglement Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confinement in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), binding quarks and gluons into hadrons, is characterized by a linear potential and the Wilson loop area law. We develop an analytical framework in $\text{SU(3)}$ gauge theory, proposing a hybrid effective string model that integrates chromoelectric flux tubes with topological corrections from \(\mathbb{Z}_3\) center vortices. Using strong-coupling expansion, we derive the Wilson loop expectation value, incorporating novel logarithmic vortex corrections, and compute a modified confining potential with non-universal terms. A central focus is the entanglement entropy of a confined quark-antiquark pair, modeled as a phase-damping quantum channel driven by the $\text{SU(3)}$ confining potential and vortex effects. We analytically demonstrate that confinement increases entropy, reflecting suppressed quantum correlations due to flux tube formation, with vortices enhancing decoherence. Our results are compared with holographic predictions. This work synthesizes $\text{SU(3)}$ gauge theory, topology, and quantum information, offering new insights into QCD confinement's quantum structure through a unique interplay of string dynamics, \(\mathbb{Z}_3\) vortices, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Residual gauge symmetry and color confinement in the Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the restoration of the residual gauge symmetry in the Yang-Mills theory to be regarded as a confinement criterion. For this purpose we restrict the four-dimensional $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills instantons to those with spatial spherical symmetry $SO(3)$, which automatically causes the dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory to the two-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge-scalar theory as implemented explicitly by the Witten transformation. In this setting, we show that the restoration of the residual gauge symmetry occurs due to condensations of instantons and anti-instantons, although the residual gauge symmetry was spontaneously broken in the perturbative vacuum. This result demonstrates that the true confinement phase is a disordered phase in which all symmetries remain unbroken.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reduction using Syzygy-Constrained Symbolic Reduction Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding computational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The algorithm starts with solving syzygy equations in individual sectors to produce IBP operators that turn seed integrals into IBP equations without artificially raised propagator powers. The IBP operators are expressed in terms of index-shift operators and number operators. We perform row reduction to systematically reshuffle the IBP operators and expose reduction rules with symbolic dependence on the powers of propagators and numerators. When this is insufficient, we produce more symbolic reduction rules by directly solving the linear system of IBP equations in which some propagator/numerator powers are kept symbolic. This linear system is kept small, as the equations are generated from a small set of seed integrals in the neighborhood of the target integral. We stress-test our algorithm against two highly non-trivial examples, namely rank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless pentabox. As an application, we revisit the IBP reduction in a calculation of scattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems, which involves two-loop Feynman integrals with complexity greater than 20, and achieve much faster IBP reduction than that of the original calculation.</description>

      <title>On the Yamazaki-Hori solution of the Ernst equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of solutions to the Ernst equation is presented, which, in a certain limit, recovers the Yamazaki-Hori solution - an extension of the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions for all integer values of the deformation parameter $\delta$. Our solution also recovers, as a special case, the formulation given by Vein, which is equivalent to the Yamazaki-Hori solution. Furthermore, our construction establishes a connection to a nonlinear differential equation proposed by Cosgrove, which is also associated with the Ernst equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the deformed Schur index in four dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theories with $SO$ and $Sp$ gauge groups, generalizing Hatsuda's recent calculations. We express the deformed Schur index as integrals of Koornwinder polynomials and Macdonald polynomials, then perform the integrals in terms of the normalization constants of Macdonald polynomials. We provide explicit results for some low rank gauge groups and for expansion in a $u$ parameter. We discuss various special limits and the tests of S-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss algebraic universality in the sense of P. Vogel for the simplest refined quantity, the Macdonald dimensions. The main known source of universal quantities is given by Chern-Simons theory. Refinement of Chern-Simons theory means introducing additional parameters. At the level of symmetric functions, the refinement is the transition from the Schur functions to the Macdonald polynomials. We consider the Macdonald polynomials associated with the simple Lie algebras, define Macdonald dimensions and dual Macdonald dimensions, and present a universal formula for them that unifies these quantities for algebras associated with simply laced root systems. We also consider mixed Macdonald dimensions that depend on two different root systems.</description>

      <title>UV completions of scalar-tensor EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study models that give rise to scalar-tensor effective field theories (EFTs) at low energies. Our framework involves massive particles of spin $S=0, 1/2, 1$ coupled to gravity and to a real massless scalar in the UV. Integrating out the massive states leads to a scalar-tensor EFT describing the massless graviton and scalar degrees of freedom. Using the on-shell amplitude methods and the spinor-helicity formalism, we match the two frameworks at one loop, so as to express the EFT Wilson coefficients in terms of the UV masses and coupling. We explore the space of the operators generated in the EFT, including the ones related to the scalar Gauss-Bonnet (SGB) and dynamical Chern-Simons (DCS) gravity theories. We demonstrate that, within our setup, the SGB interactions are always generated with shift-symmetry breaking operators. This is in contrast to the DCS case, where there is a unique choice that preserves the shift symmetry in the IR, corresponding to a theory of spin 1/2 fermions and a complex scalar with a Peccei-Quinn global symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color multiplet structure of the gauge fields and fermions on mass shell in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is considered according to representations of Weyl group W(SU(N)). An important case of singlet dynamical solutions corresponding to one-dimensional irreducible representations of the Weyl group is revised on a firm basis. We demonstrate that Weyl group as a finite color subgroup of SU(N) manifests a universal singlet structure of one-particle Weyl symmetric quark-gluon solutions. It has been shown that Abelian projected SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with fermions admits only one type of a singlet constituent quark dressed in a singlet gluon field. Physical applications in hadron physics are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name "Asymgenesis", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Purity in Open Systems: A Breakdown of the Lindblad Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems. Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to describe subtle quantum behaviors.</description>

      <title>Twisting inflation to sub-Planckian axion decay constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pseudoscalar inflation in the Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (first-order) formulation of gravity while allowing for torsion. We introduce two non-minimal interactions in the gravitational sector: pseudoscalar couplings to the Pontryagin density (Chern-Simons term) and the Nieh-Yan topological invariant. In the presence of these terms, the rolling pseudoscalar sources non-trivial torsional fields during inflation. We show that pathological gradient and ghost instabilities limit the strength of the coupling to the Pontryagin density during inflation. Furthermore, we show that the interaction with the Nieh-Yan term induces a new contribution to the pseudoscalar kinetic term, which parametrically increases its decay constant and allows for inflation on steep potentials. The torsion field generated by the background is parity violating, which is manifest in the resulting chiral gravitational wave spectrum. We find that the scalar sector is largely unaffected beyond the remapping of the axion decay constant to a larger value. Consequently, we show that while natural inflation with a cosine potential remains inconsistent with observations, the squared quartic hilltop potential can be made consistent with Planck 2018 data even for sub-Planckian decay constants by coupling to the Nieh-Yan term.</description>

      <title>Causal structure and topology change in (2+1)-dimensional simplicial gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for analyzing the causal structure at vertices in (2+1)-dimensional Lorentzian simplicial gravity. By examining the intersection patterns of lightcones emanating from a vertex with its simplicial neighbourhood, we identify 13 distinct causal types of Lorentzian tetrahedra-excluding configurations with null faces. This forms the basis for a topological classification of the local causal structure in terms of the number of connected spacelike and timelike regions on the triangulated 2-sphere surrounding the vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular causal structures and new types of causal irregular configurations, generalizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and `Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.
  We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by analyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit configurations. Transitions in vertex causal structure coincide with singularities in the curvature and action, suggesting discrete topology change. Causally irregular hinges correspond to discrete conical singularities, while vertex causal irregularities manifest as point-like singularities. Interestingly, we find that vertex and hinge causality are generally independent. These results have direct implications for discrete quantum gravity approaches where the emergence of semiclassical spacetime depends on how causal structures are encoded within the triangulation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopoles: Theoretical Insights into the Cosmic Ray Conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy (UHE) photons above 10^{18} eV serve as valuable probes of fundamental physics. While typically produced in interactions involving charged particles, they could also originate from exotic sources such as annihilations of magnetically charged monopole-antimonopole pairs or decays of highly accelerated monopoles (10^{21} eV). Detecting such photons would impose constraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and extensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A possible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's quantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields. His argument, rooted in the positivity of the Hilbert space norm, suggests that isolated magnetic monopoles may not be physically realizable. If correct, this would imply that while monopoles remain mathematically well-defined within field theories, only magnetically neutral configurations could exist in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, Scalar Fields, and GUP-Corrected Thermodynamics of Charged BTZ-like Black Holes in Bopp-Podolsky Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Ref. [1], the spacetime geometry generated by compact objects in $(2+1)$-dimensional Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics is derived. Using a perturbative approach, the authors derived a charged BTZ-like black hole solution and computed corrections up to second order in a perturbative expansion valid far from the horizon. In this work, we investigate the same circularly symmetric three-dimensional charged BH solution pierced by disclinations. We begin by analyzing the motion of photons within this spacetime, focusing on how the geometric parameters influence the effective potential governing null geodesic motion. The corresponding equations of motion are derived, and the resulting orbital dynamics are explored through graphical methods to show the influence of key parameters including the BH mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and BP coupling parameter $b^2$. Extending our analysis to wave dynamics, we examine the propagation of massless scalar fields in the BH solution by solving the Klein-Gordon equation. Through suitable coordinate transformations, we derive a Schr\"odinger-like equation with an effective potential that encodes the influence of the topological defect and electromagnetic corrections. Additionally, we investigate quantum gravitational effects by applying the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) to derive a GUP-corrected Hawking temperature, revealing systematic suppression of thermal radiation that could lead to stable BH remnants. Finally, we compute Keplerian frequencies for circular orbits, demonstrating how the interplay between charge, nonlinear electrodynamics, and disclination parameters creates distinctive observational signatures that could potentially test modified gravity theories in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement production in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model and its variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$. All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory (RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect, arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.</description>

Abstract: HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ...
  We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE 1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$), while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios.
  Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the thermal renormalized energy-momentum tensor components of a massless scalar field, leading to trace anomaly, on a $(1+1)$ dimensional static black hole spacetime. Using these, the energy density and flux, seen by both static and freely-falling observers, are evaluated. Interestingly for both these observers the aforementioned quantities in Unruh and Boulware vacua are finite at the horizon when the scalar field is in thermal equilibrium with the horizon temperature (given by the Hawking expression). Whereas in Hartle-Hawking vacuum both the observers see finite energy-density and flux at the horizon, irrespective of the value of field temperature. Particularly in the case of Schwarzschild spacetime, a freely falling observer finds its initial critical position $r^c_i = (3/2)r_H$, where $r_H$ is the horizon radius for which energy-density vanishes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed analytical investigation of the propagation of gravitational waves in bimetric gravity in a late-time de Sitter epoch. In this regime, the dynamical equations for the massless and massive graviton modes can be decoupled and solved exactly. We provide uniform approximations for the modes in terms of elementary functions, which are valid on all scales and for all viable mass windows. We identify different dynamical regimes for the system, depending on the propagation properties of the massive graviton, and whether the massless and massive components of the signal can be temporally resolved or not. In each regime, we compute the gravitational-wave luminosity distance as a function of redshift and study the propagation of wave packets. Further, by an explicit computation, we show that the massless and massive components of the signal retain their coherence also in the regime where they can be temporally resolved, even when couplings to incoherent matter degrees of freedom are included.</description>

Abstract: The classical many-body problem is reformulated as a bosonic quantum field theory. Quantum field operators evolve unitarily in the Heisenberg picture so that a quantum Vlasov equation is satisfied as an operator identity. The formalism enables the direct transfer of techniques from quantum information and quantum many-body field theory to classical nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Implications for quantum algorithms are discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore positivity bounds for the effective field theory~(EFT) of a single weakly coupled massive vector field. The presence of both mass and spin makes the crossing properties of the amplitudes vastly complicated -- we address this by parametrizing the amplitudes as products of a polarization matrix and a vector of appropriately chosen functions with simpler crossing properties. The resulting framework involves sum rules and null constraints that allows us to constrain any combination of low-energy observables, such as EFT amplitudes. By varying the value of the vector mass over the cutoff scale, some of our bounds asymptote to the bounds obtained in the context of photons and massless scalars. This work paves the way for future applications to e.g. non-abelian massive vectors, glueballs and theories with spin larger than one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the complexity of quantum field theories (QFTs) by proposing a measure of information contained in a QFT and its observables. We show that from minimal assertions, one is naturally led to measure complexity by two integers, called format and degree, which characterize the information content of the functions and domains required to specify a theory or an observable. The strength of this proposal is that it applies to any physical quantity, and can therefore be used for analyzing complexities within an individual QFT, as well as studying the entire space of QFTs. We discuss the physical interpretation of our approach in the context of perturbation theory, symmetries, and the renormalization group. Key applications include the detection of complexity reductions in observables, for example due to algebraic relations, and understanding the emergence of simplicity when considering limits. The mathematical foundations of our constructions lie in the framework of sharp o-minimality, which ensures that the proposed complexity measure exhibits general properties inferred from consistency and universality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the celestial CFT dual to theories with bulk supersymmetry. The boundary theory realizes supersymmetry in the spirit of the Green-Schwarz superstring: there is manifest 4d super-Poincar\'e symmetry, but no 2d superconformal symmetry. Nevertheless, we can extend the celestial sphere itself to a supermanifold -- the celestial supersphere. This provides a unified framework for describing key features of celestial holography, including conformally soft theorems, OPEs, and chiral soft algebras. Using these tools, we demonstrate that the $\frak{bms}_{4}$ algebra extends to a novel $\frak{sbms}_{4|\mathcal{N}}$ algebra. We also relate the supersymmetric $L(w_{1+\infty}^\wedge)$ algebra to Hamiltonian vector fields on $\mathbb{C}^{2|\mathcal{N}}$, consistent with the expectation from twistor theory, and deduce the deformation of this algebra by a cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. These results are all universal and independent of the specific details of the underlying theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we used methods of arithmetic geometry to study the anomaly-free irreducible representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra. Here we generalize to the case of products of irreducible representations, where it is again possible to give a complete description. A key result is that the projective variety corresponding to $m$-fold product representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_n$ is a rational variety for every $m$ and $n$. We study the simplest case of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ (corresponding to the strong interaction) in detail. We also describe the implications of a number-theoretic conjecture of Manin (and related theorems) for the number of chiral representations of bounded size $B$ (measured roughly by the Dynkin labels) compared to non-chiral ones, giving a precise meaning to the sense in which the former (which are those most relevant for phenomenology) are rare compared to the latter. As examples, we show that, for both irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}_5$ and once-reducible product representations of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ that are non-anomalous, the number of chiral representations is asymptotically between $B (\log B)^5$ and $B^\frac{4}{3}$, while the number of non-chiral representations is asymptotically $B^2$. Despite this rarity of chiral, anomaly-free, product representations, we show that there are examples relevant for phenomenology, including one that gives an asymptotically-free gauge theory with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the logarithmic temperature corrections to the thermodynamic entropy of four-dimensional near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter (dS) black hole by computing a one-loop contribution within the path integral framework in the near-horizon limit. Due to the presence of three horizons, the extremal limit of a charged dS black hole is fundamentally different from its flat and AdS counterparts. In the near-horizon limit, there are three distinct extremal limits known as cold, Nariai, and ultracold configurations. We compute the tensor zero modes of the Lichnerowicz operator acting on linearized metric perturbations for the cold and Nariai extremal limits which are associated with near-horizon AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$ asymptotic symmetries. In particular in the near-Nariai limit we compute the quantum corrections to the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction at late times. Our computation establishes the result that at leading order, the small temperature corrections to the extremal entropy is universal in the cold and Nariai limit, paving the way for similar such computations and tests in higher dimensional dS black hole spacetimes, including rotating dS black holes.</description>

Abstract: Thermal two-point functions in holographic CFTs receive contributions from two parts. One part comes from the identity, the stress tensor and multi-stress tensors and constitutes the stress-tensor sector. The other part consists of contributions from double-trace operators. The sum of these two parts must satisfy the KMS condition -- it has to be periodic in Euclidean time. The stress-tensor sector can be computed by analyzing the bulk equations of motions near the AdS boundary and is not periodic by itself. We show that starting from the expression for the stress-tensor sector one can impose the KMS condition to fix the double-trace part, and hence the whole correlator. We perform explicit calculations in the asymptotic approximation, where the stress-tensor sector can be computed exactly. One can either sum over the thermal images of the stress-tensor sector and subtract the singularities or solve for the KMS condition directly and perform the Borel resummation of the resulting double-trace data -- the results are the same.</description>

      <title>String Duals of Two-Dimensional Yang-Mills and Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a bosonic string dual to large $N$ chiral Yang-Mills in two dimensions at finite 't Hooft coupling. The worldsheet theory is a $\beta$-$\gamma$ system deformed by a chiral Polchinski-Strominger term. We reproduce the partition function on a torus, cylinder three-point amplitudes, and the area law for Wilson loops. We also present candidate string duals to symmetric product orbifolds for general seed CFTs with $c&lt;24$ and their $T\bar{T}$-, $J\bar{T}$-deformations. The results hint at interrelations among confining, nonrelativistic and matrix strings, and AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-theory levels in physics and math</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe the basics of a dictionary between Chern-Simons levels in three-dimensional gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) and the (coincidentally-named) Ruan-Zhang levels for twisted quantum K-theory in mathematics. Each defines a twisting of quantum K-theory, and our proposed dictionary identifies these two twistings, in the cases of projective spaces, Grassmannians, and flag manifolds. We verify the dictionary by realizing the Coulomb branch equations as symbols of certain differential operators annihilating a twisted version of the I function associated to the abelianized GLSM theory, and also by comparing the geometric window for Chern-Simons levels to an analogous window for the Ruan-Zhang levels. In the process, we interpret the geometric window for the Chern-Simons levels in terms of equalities of I and J functions. This provides a fuller mathematical understanding of some special cases in the physics literature. We also make conjectures for twisted quantum K-theory of gerbes, following up earlier conjectures on ordinary quantum K-theory of gerbes.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model: A Strongly Correlated System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model provides an analytically tractable framework for exotic strongly correlated phases where conventional paradigms like Landau's Fermi liquid theory collapse. This review offers a pedagogical introduction to the SYK physics, highlighting its unique capacity to model \textit{strange metals} -- systems exhibiting linear-in-temperature resistivity, Planckian dissipation, and quasiparticle breakdown. We systematically construct both Majorana and complex fermion variants, transforming them into training grounds for modern many-body physics techniques, for instance, (1) large-$N$ formulations via disorder averaging and replica symmetry, (2) Schwinger-Dyson and Kadanoff-Baym equations, (3) imaginary time Matsubara formulation, (4) real-time dynamics via Keldysh formalism, and the associated (5) non-perturbative Keldysh contour deformations. These tools lay the foundation for equilibrium thermodynamics, quantum chaos, quench dynamics, and transport in the thermodynamic limit, all within a solvable, chaotic quantum system. Intended as a self-contained resource, the review bridges advanced technical machinery to physical insights, with computational implementations provided. Though principally treating the SYK model as a condensed matter laboratory, we also highlight its profound connection to quantum gravity, woven throughout this work, underscoring how this solvable chaotic fermionic model serves as a lens onto black hole thermodynamics and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Witten conjecture through spectral curve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Witten conjecture, which connects a descendent enumerative theory with a specific reduction of KP integrable hierarchy. Our conjecture is realized by two parts: Part I (Geometry) establishes a correspondence between the geometric descendent potential (apart from ancestors) and the topological recursion of specific spectral curve data $(\Sigma, x,y)$; Part II (Integrability) claims that the TR descendent potential, defined at the boundary points of the spectral curve (where $dx$ has poles), is a tau-function of a certain reduction of the multi-component KP hierarchy.
  In this paper, we show the geometric part of the conjecture for any formal descendent theory by using a generalized Laplace transform. Subsequently, we prove the integrability conjecture for the one-boundary cases. As applications, we generalize and prove the $r$KdV integrability of negative $r$-spin theory conjectured by Chidambaram, Garcia-Failde and Giacchetto. We also show the KdV integrability of the total descendent potential associated with the Hurwitz space $M_{1,1}$, whose Frobenius manifold was initially introduced by Dubrovin.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan \textit{et al.} [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023267}{Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)}] and Chen \textit{et al.} [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013226}{Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)}], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stimulated emission and absorption of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state immersed in a thermal radiation bath. Employing one-loop interaction-picture perturbation theory, we track the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in the squeezed vacuum, which characterizes the inflationary graviton state. In a Minkowski background with a thermal bath as a toy example, we demonstrate that the net graviton emission or absorption rate depends sensitively on the initial squeezing parameters. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors operating in radiation at temperatures of order 0.1 GeV and find that graviton occupation numbers at frequencies of order 100 Hz can be significantly enhanced, suggesting a novel mechanism for amplifying gravitational-wave signals. Although these conditions exceed current experimental capabilities, they point toward potential future advances in detection. Extending our analysis to an expanding, radiation-dominated universe, we show that subhorizon gravitons undergo stimulated absorption, while superhorizon modes exhibit secular logarithmic growth, indicating the breakdown of perturbative methods and motivating further investigation. These findings open a new direction for exploring graviton coherence effects in realistic cosmological and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. These lattice models flow to the $c =1$ compact boson conformal field theory, with a twist that depends on the lattice size modulo four. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of General Relativity (GR) has recently been expanded through the introduction of Cotton Gravity (CG), a theoretical extension proposed by J. Harada. This modified approach integrates the Cotton tensor into the gravitational field equations, naturally encompassing all conventional GR solutions while allowing the cosmological constant to emerge as an integration constant. In this study, we delve into the implications of CG when coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), constructing and analyzing three distinct static, spherically symmetric configurations. Our investigation centers on the horizon structure, metric characteristics, and the underlying NLED Lagrangian density of each model. We also confront the theoretical predictions with observational data by comparing the calculated shadow radii of these solutions to constraints imposed by the Event Horizon Telescope's (EHT) measurements of Sgr A$^{*}$. The results reveal an extensive spectrum of spacetime geometries, ranging from multi-horizon structures to naked singularities. Furthermore, the agreement between the predicted shadow sizes and EHT observations reinforces the viability of these models in describing the astrophysical image of Sgr A$^{*}$ within certain parameter bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, in the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

      <title>Circular orbits and accretion disk around a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To examine the motion of an electrically charged test particle, we propose an expression for electromagnetic 4-potential that contains the impacts of loop quantum gravity. This electromagnetic 4-potential satisfies approximately the covariant Maxwell's equations to first order in the loop quantum effects. We explore the effects of the loop quantum correction parameter on the particle geodesics. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both neutral and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the loop quantum parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Finally, we explore the accretion disk around the loop quantum black hole. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and the spectral luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the loop quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the relaxation time approximation under a constant mass profile, we investigate the collective dynamics of a system of massive relativistic particles described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. We analytically derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both charge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and frequency. We expand our results in the limits of very small and very large mass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). Similar to the massless case, we identify a critical threshold in ($k \tau$) below which the correlators permit physical solutions. This behavior arises from a logarithmic branch cut in the spectral function. At higher momenta, solutions emerge significantly below this cut, corresponding to non-hydrodynamic modes. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic poles dominate in the strong coupling regime, while the weak coupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut extending along $\omega = k$ and $\omega = -k$. Notably, in the sound channel, finite mass modifies the standard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely imaginary mode. In contrast, the shear channel exhibits modes that asymptotically converge to their massless counterparts. Additionally, we compute the transport coefficients for shear and bulk viscosity, along with higher-order gradient corrections up to third order, expressed as perturbative expansions in both the small and large ($m/T$) regimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information Geometry Meets DMRG: Uhlmann Gauge Improvements in Computational Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a novel approach combining the Uhlmann gauge bundle with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Matrix Product State (MPS) techniques to enhance the representation and preservation of quantum coherence in strongly correlated many-body systems. Conventional DMRG and MPS methods frequently encounter limitations when dealing with subtle quantum correlations and entanglement structures near critical points, avoided crossings, and topologically ordered phases. By integrating the dynamical Uhlmann gauge potential and its categorical extensions into the numerical optimization and truncation procedures, our approach substantially improves coherence stability and accuracy. Through illustrative applications in quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and quantum dynamics, we demonstrate significant enhancements in precision and reliability, underscoring the broad potential of Uhlmann gauge-enhanced computational methods.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric Discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a family of varieties, the Euler discriminant locus distinguishes points where Euler characteristic differs from its generic value. We introduce a hypergeometric system associated with a flat family of very affine locally complete intersection varieties. It is proven that the Euler discriminant locus is its singular locus and is purely one-codimensional unless it is empty. Of particular interest is a family of very affine hypersurfaces. We coin the term hypergeometric discriminant for the characteristic cycle of the hypergeometric system and establish a formula in terms of likelihood equations.</description>

      <title>Stability and Criticality Behaviors of Accelerating Charged AdS Black Holes in Rainbow Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of accelerated charged Anti-de Sitter black holes in the context of rainbow gravity. Concretely, we compute the corresponding quantities needed to study the thermal stability and the critical behaviors including the phase transitions. Linking the acceleration parameter $A$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ via a constant parameter $a$, we discuss the $P$-$v$ criticality behaviors by calculating the critical pressure $P_c$, the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical specific volume $v_c$ in terms of $a$ and the rainbow gravity parameter $\varepsilon$. As results, we reveal that the ratio $ \dfrac{P_{c}v_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is an universal number with respect to the charge. In small limits of the external parameters, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Schwarzian Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we promote the global $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the Schwarzian derivative to a local gauge symmetry. To achieve this, we develop a procedure that potentially can be generalized beyond the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ case: We first construct a composite field from the fundamental field and its derivative such that it transforms linearly under the group action. Then we write down its gauge-covariant extension and apply standard gauging techniques. Applying this to the fractional linear representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, we obtain the gauge-invariant analogue of the Schwarzian derivative as a bilinear invariant of covariant derivatives of the composite field. The framework enables a simple construction of N\"other charges associated with the original global symmetry. The gauge-invariant Schwarzian action introduces $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge potentials, allowing for locally invariant couplings to additional fields, such as fermions. While these potentials can be gauged away on topologically trivial domains, non-trivial topologies (e.g., $S^1$) lead to distinct topological sectors. We mention that in the context of two-dimensional gravity, these sectors could correspond to previously discussed defects in the bulk theory.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.</description>

      <title>$N \leftrightarrow -N$ duality of SU(N) for stable sequences of representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize $N \leftrightarrow -N$ duality of dimension formulae of $SU(N)$ representations on a (class of) representations with $N$-dependent Young diagrams (which include the adjoint representation), and on eigenvalues of the Casimir operator for those representations. We discuss the consequences for the hypothesis of universal decomposition of powers of the adjoint representation into Casimir subspaces.</description>
