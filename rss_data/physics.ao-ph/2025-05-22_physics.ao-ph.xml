      <title>A Multi-Tiered Bayesian Network Coastal Compound Flood Analysis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coastal compound floods (CCFs) are triggered by the interaction of multiple mechanisms, such as storm surges, storm rainfall, tides, and river flow. These events can bring significant damage to communities, and there is an increasing demand for accurate and efficient probabilistic analyses of CCFs to support risk assessments and decision-making. In this study, a multi-tiered Bayesian network (BN) CCF analysis framework is established. In this framework, multiple tiers of BN models with different complexities are designed for application with varying levels of data availability and computational resources. A case study is conducted in New Orleans, LA, to demonstrate this framework. In the Tier-1 BN model, storm surges and river flow are incorporated based on hydrodynamic simulations. A seasonality node is used to capture the dependence between concurrent river flow and tropical cyclone (TC) parameters. In the Tier-2 BN model, joint distribution models of TC parameters are built for separate TC intensity categories. TC-induced rainfall is modeled as input to hydraulic simulations. In the Tier-3 BN model, potential variations of meteorological conditions are incorporated by quantifying their effects on TC activity and coastal water level. Flood antecedent conditions are also incorporated to more completely represent the conditions contributing to flood severity. In this case study, a series of joint distribution, numerical, machine learning, and experimental models are used to compute conditional probability tables needed for BNs. A series of probabilistic analyses is performed based on these BN models, including CCF hazard curve construction and CCF deaggregation. The results of the analysis demonstrate the promise of this framework in performing CCF hazard analysis under varying levels of resource availability.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Two-Dimensional, Multi-Frequency Propagation Factor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Generalizable neural-network parameterization of mesoscale eddies in idealized and global ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have become popular to parameterize the effects of mesoscale eddies in ocean models. However, they perform poorly in generalization tasks and may require retuning if the grid resolution or ocean configuration changes. We address the generalization problem by enforcing physical constraints on a neural network parameterization of mesoscale eddy fluxes. We found that the local scaling of input and output features helps to generalize to unseen grid resolutions and depths offline in the global ocean. The scaling is based on dimensional analysis and incorporates grid spacing as a length scale. We formulate our findings as a general algorithm that can be used to enforce data-driven parameterizations with dimensional scaling. The new parameterization improves the representation of kinetic and potential energy in online simulations with idealized and global ocean models. Comparison to baseline parameterizations and impact on global ocean biases are discussed.</description>

      <title>HurriCast: Synthetic Tropical Cyclone Track Generation for Hurricane Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of synthetic tropical cyclone(TC) tracks for risk assessment is a critical application of preparedness for the impacts of climate change and disaster relief, particularly in North America. Insurance companies use these synthetic tracks to estimate the potential risks and financial impacts of future TCs. For governments and policymakers, understanding the potential impacts of TCs helps in developing effective emergency response strategies, updating building codes, and prioritizing investments in resilience and mitigation projects. In this study, many hypothetical but plausible TC scenarios are created based on historical TC data HURDAT2 (HURricane DATA 2nd generation). A hybrid methodology, combining the ARIMA and K-MEANS methods with Autoencoder, is employed to capture better historical TC behaviors and project future trajectories and intensities. It demonstrates an efficient and reliable in the field of climate modeling and risk assessment. By effectively capturing past hurricane patterns and providing detailed future projections, this approach not only validates the reliability of this method but also offers crucial insights for a range of applications, from disaster preparedness and emergency management to insurance risk analysis and policy formulation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>
