      <title>Character Theory for Semilinear Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group acting on a field $L$, and suppose that $L /K$ is a finite Galois extension, where $K = L^G$. We show that the irreducible semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$ can be completely described in terms of irreducible linear representations of $H$, the kernel of $G \rightarrow \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. When $G$ is finite and $|G| \in L^{\times}$ this provides a character theory for semilinear representations of $G$ over $L$, which recovers ordinary character theory when the action of $G$ on $L$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>On the structure of modular principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2$ over some finite rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The submodule structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$, for $k$ a finite field of characteristic $p$, was described by Bardoe and Sin and has played an important role in subsequent work on the mod $p$ local Langlands correspondence. The present paper studies the structure of mod $p$ principal series representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathcal{O} / \mathfrak{m}^n)$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the ring of integers of a $p$-adic field $F$ and $\mathfrak{m}$ its maximal ideal. In particular, the multiset of Jordan-H\"older constituents is determined.
  In the case $n = 2$, more precise results are obtained. If $F / \mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified, the submodule structure of the principal series is determined completely. Otherwise the submodule structure is infinite. When $F$ is ramified but not totally ramified, the socle and radical filtrations are determined and a specific family of submodules, providing a filtration of the principal series with irreducible quotients, is studied; this family is closely related to the image of a functor of Breuil. In the case of unramified $F$, the structure of a particular submodule of the principal series is studied; this provides a more precise description of the structure of a module constructed by Breuil and Pa\u{s}k\=unas in the context of their work on diagrams giving rise to supersingular mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random Young diagrams with respect to the measure induced by the decomposition of the $p$-th exterior power of $\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{k}$ into irreducible representations of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$. We demonstrate that transition probabilities for these diagrams in the limit $n,k,p\to\infty$ with $p\sim nk$ converge to the large $N$ limiting law for the eigenvalues of random matrices in Jacobi Unitary Ensemble. We compute the characters of Young--Jucys--Murphy elements in $\bigwedge^{p}(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k})$ and discuss their relation to surface counting. We formulate several conjectures on the connection between the correlators in both random ensembles.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Localized Commutators and Cohomology of Shift Algebras on the Half-Lattice: Structure, Representations, and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary-localized Lie algebra generated by the rank-one perturbation \(T = U + \varepsilon E\) of the unilateral shift on \(\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}_{\ge\ 0})\). While the polynomial algebra \(\langle T \rangle\) is abelian, the enlarged algebra \(\mathcal{A} = \mathrm{span}\{U^a E U^b, U^n\}\) exhibits finite--rank commutators confined to a finite neighborhood of the boundary. We construct explicit site-localized 2-cocycles \(\omega_j(X,Y) = \langle e_j, [X,Y] e_j \rangle\) and prove they form a basis of \(H^2(\mathcal{A},\mathbb{C})\). Quantitative bounds and finite-dimensional models confirm a sharp bulk-edge dichotomy. The framework provides a rigorous Lie-algebraic model for edge phenomena in discrete quantum systems-without violating the Jacobi identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half a century ago Manin showed that given a number field $k$ and a rational prime $\ell$, there exists a uniform bound for the order of cyclic $\ell$-power isogenies between two non-CM elliptic curves over $k$. We generalize this to certain $2$-dimensional families of abelian $3$-folds with multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field.</description>

      <title>Characterizing higher Auslander(-Gorenstein) Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that for Auslander algebras, the category of all (finitely generated) projective modules is an abelian category and this property of abelianness characterizes Auslander algebras by Tachikawa theorem in 1974.
  Let $n$ be a positive integer. In this paper, by using torsion theoretic methods, we show that $ n $-Auslander algebras can be characterized by the abelianness of the category of modules with projective dimension less than $ n $ and a certain additional property, extending the classical Auslander-Tachikawa theorem. By Auslander-Iyama correspondence a categorical characterization of the class of Artin algebras having $ n $-cluster tilting modules is obtained.
  Since higher Auslander algebras are a special case of higher Auslander-Gorenstein algebras, the results are given in the general setting as extending previous results of Kong. Moreover, as an application of some results, we give categorical descriptions for the semisimplicity and selfinjectivity of an Artin algebra.
  Higher Auslander-Gorenstein Algebras are also studied from the viewpoint of cotorsion pairs and, as application, we show that they satisfy in two nice equivalences.</description>

      <title>Category $\mathcal{O}$ for Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The authors define a Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a triangular decomposition. This much needed approach unifies many important constructions in the existing literature in a rigorous fashion. Our Category $\mathcal{O}$ encompasses all highest weight categories for Lie (super)algebras as well as specific examples which may not be highest weight categories. When the decomposition arises from a principal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ exhibits rich homological properties. For one, the authors show that in contrast to the case of a semisimple Lie algebra, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ is standardly stratified.
  Furthermore, the categorical cohomology of $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated ring. This provides a first step towards developing a support variety theory for Category $\mathcal{O}$. It is shown that the complexity of modules in Category $\mathcal{O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in $\mathfrak{g}$. This upgrades results known for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ to the more general setting. Our arguments are based on foundational connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology as well as the interplay between Category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and the Category $\mathcal{O}$ for its corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar 0}$.</description>

      <title>Archimedean Bernstein-Zelevinsky Theory and Homological Branching Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory for quasi-split real classical groups and employ this framework to establish an Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic formula for general linear groups. The key to our approach is establishing the Casselman-Wallach property for the homology of the Jacquet functor, which also provides an affirmative resolution to an open question proposed by A. Aizenbud, D. Gourevitch and S. Sahi. Furthermore, we prove the vanishing of higher extension groups for arbitrary pairs of generic representations, confirming a conjecture of Dipendra Prasad.
  We also utilize the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to establish two additional results: the Leibniz law for the highest derivative and a unitarity criterion for general linear groups.
  Lastly, we apply the Bernstein-Zelevinsky theory to prove the Hausdorffness and exactness of the twisted homology of split even orthogonal groups.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Hall algebras, their categorification, and their representations via torsion pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a systematic way of producing representations of cohomological, K-theoretical and categorified Hall algebras, and study the output of our construction in several cases. We thus recover and categorify in a unified framework the action of the COHA of a quiver on the cohomology of Nakajima quiver variety, the action of the COHA of zero-dimensional sheaves on the the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points and moduli spaces of Gieseker-stable sheaves on smooth surfaces, recovering the constructions of Negu\c{t} and DeHority. We also obtain new examples, associated to Pandharipande-Thomas stable pairs.
  Along the way, we explain carefully under which conditions one can associate to a pair $(\mathscr{C},\tau)$ consisting of a stable $\infty$-category with a t-structure a COHA. This requires a careful analysis and extension of Khan's theory of motivic Borel-Moore homology to the non quasi-compact setting, and it allows to produce new examples of COHAs arising from Bridgeland's stability conditions.
  The representations that we construct take an extra categorical input: that of a torsion pair $(\mathscr{T},\mathscr{F})$ on the heart $\mathscr{C}^\heartsuit$ of $\tau$. Under favorable conditions, the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{T}$ acquires a Hall multiplication, that acts both on the left and on the right on the homology of the moduli stack associated to $\mathscr{F}$. The left action generalizes and categorifies Nakajima's positive operators, while the right action corresponds to negative operators.</description>

Abstract: The n-qubit Pauli group and its normalizer the n-qubit Clifford group have applications in quantum error correction and device characterization. Recent applications have made use of the representation theory of the Clifford group. We apply the tools of (the coincidentally named) Clifford theory to examine the representation theory of the Clifford group using the much simpler representation theory of the Pauli group. We find an unexpected correspondence between irreducible characters of the n-qubit Clifford group and those of the (n+1)-qubit Clifford group.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of excisive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a thick subcategory theorem for the category of $d$-excisive functors from finite spectra to spectra. This generalizes the Hopkins-Smith thick subcategory theorem (the $d=1$ case) and the $C_2$-equivariant thick subcategory theorem (the $d=2$ case). We obtain our classification theorem by completely computing the Balmer spectrum of compact $d$-excisive functors. A key ingredient is a non-abelian blueshift theorem for the generalized Tate construction associated to the family of non-transitive subgroups of products of symmetric groups. Also important are the techniques of tensor triangular geometry and striking analogies between functor calculus and equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, we introduce a functor calculus analogue of the Burnside ring and describe its Zariski spectrum \`{a} la Dress. The analogy with equivariant homotopy theory is strengthened further through two applications: We explain the effect of changing coefficients from spectra to ${\mathrm{H}\mathbb{Z}}$-modules and we establish a functor calculus analogue of transchromatic Smith-Floyd theory as developed by Kuhn-Lloyd. Our work offers a new perspective on functor calculus which builds upon the previous approaches of Arone-Ching and Glasman.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories, which generalizes full exceptional sequences. The lengths of composition series yield invariants for triangulated categories. We study composition series of derived categories for some classes of projective varieties and finite-dimensional algebras. We prove that certain negative rational curves on rational surfaces cause composition series of different lengths in the derived categories of the surfaces. On the other hand, we show that for derived categories of finite-dimensional hereditary algebras, for nontrivial admissible subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(\mathbb{P}^2)$ and for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length.</description>
