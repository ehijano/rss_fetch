      <title>Two-Carrier Model-Fitting of Hall Effect in Semiconductors with Dual-Band Occupation: A Case Study in GaN Two-Dimensional Hole Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a two-carrier Hall effect model fitting algorithm to analyze temperature-dependent magnetotransport measurements of a high-density ($\sim4\times10^{13}$ cm$^2$/Vs) polarization-induced two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) in a GaN/AlN heterostructure. Previous transport studies in GaN 2DHGs have reported a two-fold reduction in 2DHG carrier density from room to cryogenic temperature. We demonstrate that this apparent drop in carrier density is an artifact of assuming one species of carriers when interpreting Hall effect measurements. Using an appropriate two-carrier model, we resolve light hole (LH) and heavy hole (HH) carrier densities congruent with self-consistent Poisson-k$\cdot$p simulations and observe an LH mobility of $\sim$1400 cm$^2$/Vs and HH mobility of $\sim$300 cm$^2$/Vs at 2 K. This report constitutes the first experimental signature of LH band conductivity reported in GaN.</description>

      <title>Terahertz channel power and BER performance in rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communications have emerged as a promising technology for 6G networks due to their potential for achieving terabit-per-second data rates. However, the impact of rainfall on THz channel characteristics remains incompletely understood, particularly regarding power attenuation mechanisms and bit error rate (BER) performance. This article presents a systematic measurement-based and theoretical investigation of line-of-sight (LoS) THz channel behavior under rainfall conditions, methodically examining both power attenuation mechanisms and bit error rate (BER) performance. Our experimental campaign, conducted at frequencies of 220-230 GHz over a 54-meter outdoor channel, is complemented by analytical frameworks incorporating ITU-R and Mie scattering models. The study reveals that while rain induces significant power attenuation, multipath scattering effects remain minimal, with Rician K-factors maintaining high values. Notably, we observe substantial variations in power loss under constant rain rates, attributed to dynamic changes in raindrop size distribution. Comparative analysis demonstrates superior BER performance of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in rainfall conditions, while revealing increased environmental sensitivity at higher frequencies. These findings underscore the necessity for adaptive modulation schemes and strategic frequency planning in future THz communication systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning enhanced multi-particle tracking in solid fuel combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle velocimetry is essential in solid fuel combustion studies, however, the accurate detection and tracking of particles in high Particle Number Density (PND) combustion scenario remain challenging. The current study advances the machine-learning approaches for precise velocity measurements of solid particles. For this, laser imaging experiments were performed for high-volatile bituminous coal particles burning in a laminar flow reactor. Particle positions were imaged using time-resolved Mie scattering. Various detection methods, including conventional blob detection and Machine Learning (ML) based You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Realtime Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) were employed and bench marked.~Particle tracking was performed using the Simple Online Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. The results demonstrated the capability of machine learning models trained on low-PND data for prediction of high-PND data. Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) algorithm is important for the better performance of the used models. By evaluating the velocity statistics, it is found that the mean particle velocity decreases with increasing PND, primarily due to stronger particle interactions. The particle dynamics are closely related to the position of combustion zone observed in the previous study. Thus, PND is considered as the dominant factor for the particle group combustion behavior of high-volatile solid fuels.</description>

      <title>Differential Magnetic Force Microscopy with a Switchable Tip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation of physical forces acting on the tip of a magnetic force microscope (MFM) is essential for correct magnetic imaging. Electrostatic forces can be modulated by varying the tip-sample potential and minimized to map the local Kelvin potential. However, distinguishing magnetic forces from van der Waals forces typically requires two measurements with opposite tip magnetizations under otherwise identical measurement conditions. Here, we present an inverted magnetic force microscope where the sample is mounted on a flat cantilever for force sensing, and the magnetic tip is attached to a miniaturized electromagnet that periodically flips the tip magnetization. This setup enables the extraction of magnetic tip-sample interactions from the sidebands occurring at the switching rate in the cantilever oscillation spectrum. Our method achieves the separation of magnetic signals from other force contributions in a single-scan mode. Future iterations of this setup may incorporate membrane, trampoline, or string resonators with ultra-high quality factors, potentially improving measurement sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art MFM systems using cantilevers.</description>

      <title>Ultralow Voltage Operation of p- and n-FETs Enabled by Self-Formed Gate Dielectric and Metal Contacts on 2D Tellurium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing demand for more energy-efficient, high-performance electronics is driving the exploration of innovative materials and device architectures, where interfaces play a crucial role due to the continuous downscaling of device dimensions. Tellurium (Te), in its two-dimensional (2D) form, offers significant potential due to its high carrier mobility and ambipolar characteristics, with the carrier type easily tunable via surface modulation. In this study, we leverage atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te to create intimate junctions, enabling near-ideal field-effect transistors (FETs) for both n-type and p-type operation. A NiTex-Te contact provides highly transparent interfaces, resulting in low contact resistance, while the TiOx-Te gate dielectric forms an ultraclean interface with a capacitance equivalent to 0.88 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), where the quantum capacitance of Te is observed. Subthreshold slopes (SS) approach the Boltzmann limit, with a record-low SS of 3.5 mV/dec achieved at 10 K. Furthermore, we demonstrate 2D Te-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) inverters operating at an ultralow voltage of 0.08 V with a voltage gain of 7.1 V/V. This work presents a promising approach to forming intimate dielectric/semiconductor and metal/semiconductor junctions for next-generation low-power electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Perturbed three-channel waveform synthesizer for efficient isolated attosecond pulse generation and characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of gigawatt-class isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) is vital for attosecond pump-probe experiments. In such experiments, the temporal duration of IAPs must be determined quickly and accurately. In this study, we developed a perturbed three-channel waveform synthesizer for efficient IAPs generation and characterization at low repetition rates ( 10 Hz). Intense IAPs centered at photon energies of 60 eV (227 as duration) in Ar and 107 eV (128 as duration) in Ne were generated by the driving field from a three-channel waveform synthesizer and characterized using all-optical frequencyresolved optical gating (AO-FROG), which accelerated the measurement time to several minutes, providing fast feedback for the tunability of the IAP source. The peak power of the IAPs is higher than that reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Effect of top metallic contacts on energy conversion performances for near-field thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of metallic contact grids on the front side of thermophotovoltaic cells is critical since it can cause significant optical and electrical resistive losses, particularly in the near field. However, from the theoretical point of view, this effect has been either discarded or studied by means of extremely simplified models like the shadowing methods, that consist in simply ignoring the fraction of the semiconductor surface covered by metal. Our study, based on a rigorous three-body theoretical framework and implemented using the scattering matrix approach with the Fourier modal method augmented with adaptive spatial resolution, provides deeper insight into the influence of the front metal contact grid. This approach allows direct access to the radiative power absorbed by the semiconductor, enabling the proposal of an alternative definition for the thermophotovoltaic cell efficiency. By modeling this grid as a metallic grating, we demonstrate its significant impact on the net radiative power absorbed by the cell and, consequently, on the generated electrical power. Our analysis reveals behaviors differing substantially from those predicted by previous simplistic approaches.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Time Interfaces in Wire Media: Innovations for Subwavelength Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study temporal interfaces between media with strong spatial dispersion and dielectrics. In particular, we consider a temporal discontinuity that transforms a wire medium sample, a metamaterial with resonant spatial dispersion, into a uniaxial dielectric. We show that this transition results in a transformation of the deeply subwavelength spatial spectrum of TEM waves propagating in the wire medium at a certain frequency into a spectrum of plane waves at new frequencies that are all higher than the initial one. The waves at different frequencies propagate in different directions. Their complex amplitudes and propagation directions are uniquely related to the amplitudes of the spatial harmonics of the fields which existed before the transition. We explain how to implement this transition. The revealed effect may result in a promising method of subwavelength imaging.</description>
