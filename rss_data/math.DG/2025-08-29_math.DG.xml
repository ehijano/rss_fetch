      <title>Cartan geometries with model the future lightlike cone of Lorentz-Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the theory of Cartan geometries modeled on the future lightlike cone of Lorentz Minkowski spacetime, which we refer to as lightlike Cartan geometries. We show that such geometries naturally induce on the base manifold a lightlike metric, a globally defined radical vector field, and two additional compatible structures. Within this framework, we construct the standard tractor bundle associated with a lightlike Cartan geometry, showing that it extends the tangent bundle of the base manifold and carries a canonical metric linear connection. This construction provides an alternative characterization of lightlike Cartan geometries purely in terms of vector bundle data. Using this alternative description, we analyze the additional geometric information encoded in the Cartan connection beyond the metric and radical data, and we show how it can be extracted via natural decompositions of the standard tractor bundle. Our results underscore the intrinsic significance of Cartan connection methods in the study of lightlike geometry and open new avenues for the analysis of geometric structures that are neither parabolic nor reductive.</description>

      <title>$b^k$-algebroids and the variety of foliation jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and classify singular foliations of $b^{k+1}$-type, which formalize the properties of vector fields that are tangent to a submanifold $W \subset M$ to order $k$. When $W$ is a hypersurface, these structures are Lie algebroids generalizing the $b^{k+1}$-tangent bundles introduced by Scott.
  We prove that singular foliations of $b^{k+1}$-type are encoded by $k$-th order foliations: jets of distributions that are involutive up to order $k$, equivalently described as foliations on the $k$-th order neighborhood of $W$. Using this encoding, we construct topological groupoids of $k$-th order foliations and employ the holonomy invariant to show that these groupoids fiber over certain character stacks, yielding Riemann-Hilbert style classifications up to local isomorphism and isotopy.
  We also study the problem of extending a $k$-th order foliation to a $(k+1)$-st order foliation. We prove that this is obstructed by a characteristic class that arises as a section of a vector bundle over the relevant character stack.</description>

      <title>Stability of weighted minimal hypersurfaces under a lower $1$-weighted Ricci curvature bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will study the $1$-weighted Ricci curvature in view of the extrinsic geometric analysis. We derive several geometric consequences concerning stable weighted minimal hypersurfaces in weighted manifolds under a lower $1$-weighted Ricci curvature bound. We prove a Schoen-Yau type criterion, and conclude a structure theorem for three-dimensional weighted manifolds of non-negative $1$-weighted Ricci curvature. We also show non-existence results under volume growth conditions, and conclude smooth compactness theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>Invariant Einstein metrics on basic classical Lie supergroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of invariant Einstein metrics on basic classical Lie supergroups, whose Lie superalgebras belong to the Kac's classification of finite dimensional classical simple Lie superalgebras over $\mathbb{R}$. We consider a natural family of left invariant metrics parameterized by scaling factors on the simple and Abelian components of the reductive even part, using the canonical bi-invariant bilinear form. Explicit expressions for the Levi-Civita connection and Ricci tensor are derived, and the Einstein condition is reduced to a solvable algebraic system. Our main result shows that, except for the cases of $\mathbf{A}(m,n)$ with $m\neq n$, $\mathbf{F}(4)$, and their real forms, every real basic classical Lie superalgebra admits at least two distinct Einstein metrics. Notably, for $\mathbf{D}(n+1,n)$ and $\mathbf{D}(2,1;\alpha)$, we obtain both Ricci flat and non Ricci flat Einstein metrics, a phenomenon not observed in the non-super setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under mild assumptions, we show that a connected weighted graph $G$ with lower Ricci curvature bound $K&gt;0$ in the sense of Bakry-\'Emery and the $d$-th non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue $\lambda_d$ close to $K$, with $d$ being the maximal combinatorial vertex degree of $G$, has an underlying combinatorial structure of the $d$-dimensional hypercube graph. Moreover, such a graph $G$ is close in terms of Frobenius distance to a properly weighted hypercube graph. Furthermore, we establish their closeness in terms of eigenfunctions. Our results can be viewed as discrete analogies of the almost rigidity theorem and quantitative Obata's theorem on Rimennian manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Equivalence for Lam\'{e}-type Equations I: Finite-gap Structures and Cone Spherical Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the finite-gap structure of the classical Lam\'{e} equation (1.2) and its central role in mathematical physics, generalized Lam\'{e}-type equations (1.12) are investigated. For the fundamental case $n=1$, a monodromy equivalence between the classical Lam\'{e} equation (1.18) and the generalized Lam\'{e}-type equation (1.19) is established. Two main applications are obtained: (i) the finite-gap structure of \ (1.19) is derived, together with a complete classification of the spectral curves $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ for $\tau\in i\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$; and (ii) the monodromy equivalence is applied to the construction of cone spherical metrics with three large conical singularities, each with cone angle exceeding $2\pi$. A family of such metrics is shown to exhibits a blow-up configuration, which is described explicitly in terms of the monodromy data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the classical and quantum problems for the 1D sigma model with target space the flag manifold $\mathrm{U}(3)\over \mathrm{U}(1)^3$, equipped with the most general invariant metric. In particular, we explicitly describe all geodesics in terms of elliptic functions and demonstrate that the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator may be found by solving polynomial (Bethe) equations. The main technical tool that we use is a mapping between the sigma model and a Gaudin model, which is also shown to hold in the $\mathrm{U}(n)$ case.</description>

      <title>H\"older estimates for degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform $L^\infty$ and H\"older estimates were proved by the Kolodziej for complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on compact K\"ahler manifolds with $L^p$ volume measure with $p&gt;1$. On the other hand, establishing H\"older estimates on singular K\"ahler varieties has remained open. In this paper, we establish uniform H\"older continuity for a family of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on K\"ahler varieties, by developing a geometric regularization based on the partial $C^0$ estimate, i.e., quantitive Kodaira embeddings. As an application, we prove that local potentials of smoothable K\"ahler-Einstein varieties are H\"older continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By definition, the edge-connectivity of a connected graph is no larger than its minimum degree. In this paper, we prove that the edge connectivity of a finite connected graph with non-negative Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to its minimum degree. This answers an open question of Chen, Liu and You. Notice that our conclusion would be false if we did not require the graph to be finite. We actually classify all connected graphs with non-negative Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and edge-connectivity smaller than their minimum degree. In particular, they are all infinite.</description>

      <title>Entropy and stability of hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07422v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g_0)$ be a closed oriented hyperbolic manifold of dimension at least $3$. By the volume entropy inequality of G. Besson, G. Courtois and S. Gallot, for any Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ with same volume as $g_0$, its volume entropy $h(g)$ satisfies $h(g)\geq n-1$ with equality only when $g$ is isometric to $g_0$. We show that the hyperbolic metric $g_0$ is stable in the following sense: if $g_i$ is a sequence of Riemaniann metrics on $M$ of same volume as $g_0$ and if $h(g_i)$ converges to $n-1$, then there are smooth subsets $Z_i\subset M$ such that both $\mathrm{Vol}(Z_i,g_i)$ and $\mathrm{Area}(\partial Z_i,g_i)$ tend to $0$, and $(M\setminus Z_i,g_i)$ converges to $(M,g_0)$ in the measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology. The proof relies on showing that any spherical Plateau solution for $M$ is intrinsically isomorphic to $(M,\frac{(n-1)^2}{4n} g_0)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a punctured Riemann surface with Euler characteristic $\chi(S)&lt;0$. For any unitary representation $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, we introduce its renormalized energy and its harmonic representatives, which are equivariant harmonic maps from the universal cover of $S$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Our main result is that if a sequence of unitary representations $\rho_j$ strongly converges, then their renormalized energies converge to $\frac{\pi}{4}|\chi(S)|$ and the shape of their harmonic representatives converges to a unique rescaled hyperbolic metric. Combining this statement with examples of strongly converging representations provided by random matrix theory, we derive the following applications.
  (1) If $\pi_1(S)$ is a free group, then for a random $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, the shape of its harmonic representatives concentrates around a rescaled hyperbolic metric with high probability as $N\to \infty$.
  (2) For any closed hyperbolic surface, a finite covering admits a harmonic immersion into some Euclidean unit sphere, which is almost isometric after rescaling.
  (3) There are closed, branched, minimal surfaces $\mathfrak{S}_j$ in some Euclidean unit spheres such that $\mathfrak{S}_j$ Benjamini-Schramm converges to a rescaled hyperbolic plane as $j\to \infty$, and the Gaussian curvature $K_j$ of $\mathfrak{S}_j$ satisfies $\lim_{j\to \infty} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Area}(\mathfrak{S}_j)}\int_{\mathfrak{S}_j} |K_j+8|=0.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work, Kai Tang conjectured that any compact Hermitian manifold with non-zero constant mixed curvature must be K\"ahler. He confirmed the conjecture in complex dimension $2$ and for Chern K\"ahler-like manifolds in general dimensions. In this paper, we verify his conjecture for several special types of Hermitian manifolds, including complex nilmanifolds, solvmanifolds with complex commutators, almost abelian Lie groups, and Lie algebras containing a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of codimension $2$. We also verify the conjecture for all compact balanced threefolds when the Bismut connection has parallel torsion. These results provide partial evidence towards the validity of Tang's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Optimal decay constant for complete manifolds of positive scalar curvature with quadratic decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if an orientable 3-manifold $M$ admits a complete Riemannian metric whose scalar curvature is positive and has at most $C$-quadratic decay at infinity for some $C &gt; \frac{2}{3}$, then it decomposes as a (possibly infinite) connected sum of spherical manifolds and $\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$ summands. Consequently, $M$ carries a complete Riemannian metric of uniformly positive scalar curvature. The decay constant $\frac{2}{3}$ is sharp, as demonstrated by metrics on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$. This improves a result of Balacheff, Gil Moreno de Mora Sard\`a, and Sabourau, and partially answers a conjecture of Gromov. The main tool is a new exhaustion result using $\mu$-bubbles.
  In dimensions $n = 4, 5$, we further extend results of Chodosh--Maximo--Mukherjee and Sweeney, and obtain topological obstructions to the existence of a complete Riemannian metric whose scalar curvature is positive and has at most $C$-quadratic decay at infinity for some $C &gt; \frac{n-1}{n}$ on certain noncompact contractible $n$-manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study Riemannian metrics on 2-surfaces with integrable geodesic flows such that an additional first integral is high-degree polynomial in momenta. This problem reduces to searching for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. We construct plenty of local explicit and implicit integrable examples with polynomial first integrals of degrees 3, 4, 5. Our construction is essentially based on applying the generalized hodograph method.</description>
