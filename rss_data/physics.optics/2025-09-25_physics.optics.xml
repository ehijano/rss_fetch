      <title>Comb-Driven Coherent Optical Transmitter for Scalable DWDM Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand for large-scale artificial intelligence applications, disaggregated compute nodes and high-radix switches in next-generation computing clusters are set to surpass the capacity of current optical interconnect technologies. Such a surge turns several aspects of transmitters into critical bottlenecks: shoreline bandwidth density and energy efficiency are effectively limiting the scalability. We present a comb-driven coherent optical transmitter architecture on a Si/SiN platform that provides the bandwidth density, energy efficiency, and compact footprint required for such co-packaged-enabled optical interconnects. We evaluate scalability through critical building blocks, including ultra-compact microring-assisted Mach--Zehnder modulators (MRA-MZMs) and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) interleavers. Single-tone experiments demonstrate a net line rate of 400 Gbps per polarization (16-QAM, 120 GBd) in silicon within the O-band, achieving a record shoreline density of 4 Tbps/mm while consuming only 10 fJ/bit for modulation. We also demonstrate transmission rates of up to 160 GBd QPSK in back-to-back and 100 GBd over 7 km of fiber without dispersion compensation. Using a quantum-dot frequency comb, six 100 GHz-spaced WDM channels transmit 1.08 Tbps over 5 km. System-level analyses show that by leveraging advanced modulation formats through the integration of wavelength and polarization multiplexing, our proposed architecture can realistically support combined transmission rates exceeding 10 Tbps per fiber within practical limits of power consumption and packaging, outlining a clear path toward future petabit-scale interconnects.</description>

      <title>Stray light in 3D porous nanostructures of single crystalline copper film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the design of optical devices and components, geometric structures and optical properties of materials, such as absorption, refraction, reflection, diffraction, scattering, and trapping, have been utilized. Finding the ideal material with certain optical and geometric characteristics is essential for a customized application. Here, we fabricated unoxidizable achromatic copper films (ACFs) on Al2O3 substrates utilizing an atomic sputtering epitaxy apparatus. ACFs are made up of two regions vertically: a comparatively flat layer region and a three-dimensional (3D) porous nanostructured region on top of the flat region. The measured specular reflectance displayed low-pass filter behaviour with a sharp cutoff frequency in the infrared spectrum. Furthermore, the measured diffusive reflectance spectra showed light-trapping behaviour in the spectral region above the cutoff frequency, where there are no known absorption mechanisms, such as phonons and interband transitions. A focused ion beam scanning electron microscope was utilized to study the thin film's nanostructured region through 3D tomographic analysis in order to comprehend the phenomena that were observed. This work will shed fresh light on the design and optimization of optical filters and light-trapping employing porous nanostructured metallic thin films.</description>

      <title>Gaussian splatting holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-line holography offers high space-bandwidth product imaging with a simplified lens-free optical system. However, in-line holographic reconstruction is troubled by twin images arising from the Hermitian symmetry of complex fields. Twin images disrupt the reconstruction in solving the ill-posed phase retrieval problem. The known parameters are less than the unknown parameters, causing phase ambiguities. State-of-the-art deep-learning or non-learning methods face challenges in balancing data fidelity with twin-image disturbance. We propose the Gaussian splatting holography (GSH) for twin-image-suppressed holographic reconstruction. GSH uses Gaussian splatting for optical field representation and compresses the number of unknown parameters by a maximum of 15 folds, transforming the original ill-posed phase retrieval into a well-posed one with reduced phase ambiguities. Additionally, the Gaussian splatting tends to form sharp patterns rather than those with noisy twin-image backgrounds as each Gaussian has a spatially slow-varying profile. Experiments show that GSH achieves constraint-free recovery for in-line holography with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art constraint-based methods, with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio equal to 26 dB, and structure similarity equal to 0.8. Combined with total variation, GSH can be further improved, obtaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 31 dB, and a high compression ability of up to 15 folds.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Boundary States and Phase Transitions in Graphene Flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain has been extensively employed to tailor graphene's properties and has emerged as a powerful tool for engineering gauge fields and exploring fundamental phenomena in artificial platforms like photonic graphene. Here we discover that, in graphene flakes with custom boundaries, one can create or destroy edge states depending on the direction of the applied uniaxial strain. This is experimentally demonstrated in a photonic platform with two specific examples: one flake structure with pairs of twig and zigzag edges, and the other with pairs of armchair and bearded edges. We find that the existence of the edge states and their positions in momentum space are accurately predicted with appropriate winding numbers, unveiling the underlying topology of such edge states. Furthermore, when a graphene flake supports the maximum number of edge states along boundaries after a semimetal-to-insulator transition, both compact localized edge and corner states emerge, indicating the realization of a photonic minimal-model higher-order topological insulator based on such strained graphene flakes.</description>

      <title>Parallel overlapping-domain decomposition FDFD for large-scale complex nanostructures modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of photonic and electromagnetic devices demand efficient and accurate numerical solvers. In this work, we develop a parallel overlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) based on the finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) formulation to model the electromagnetic response of large-scale complex nanostructures. The global computational domain is partitioned into multiple overlapping subdomains terminated with perfectly matched layers (PMLs), enabling seamless source transfer between adjacent subdomains. A multi-frontal preconditioner is employed to accelerate the iterative solution process, while an OpenMP-based parallel implementation ensures high scalability. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with analytical and commercial COMSOL solutions. Notably, the method achieves up to an order of magnitude reduction in computation time, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for large-scale photonic and electromagnetic modeling.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Nanophotonic Inverse Design using Volume Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing nanophotonic devices with minimal human intervention has gained substantial attention due to the complexity and precision required in modern optical technologies. While inverse design techniques typically rely on conventional electromagnetic solvers as forward models within optimization routines, the substantial electrical size and subwavelength characteristics of nanophotonic structures necessitate significantly accelerated simulation methods. In this work, we introduce a forward modeling approach based on the volume integral equation (VIE) formulation as an efficient alternative to traditional finite-difference (FD)-based methods. We derive the adjoint method tailored specifically for the VIE framework to efficiently compute optimization gradients and present a novel unidirectional mode excitation strategy compatible with VIE solvers. Comparative benchmarks demonstrate that our VIE-based approach provides multiple orders of magnitude improvement in computational efficiency over conventional FD methods in both time and frequency domains. To validate the practical utility of our approach, we successfully designed two representative nanophotonic components: a selective mode reflector and a 3 dB power splitter. Our results underscore the significant runtime advantages offered by the VIE-based framework, highlighting its promising role in accelerating inverse design workflows for next-generation nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Mode Sorting in Turbulence with Task-Dependent Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical deployment of high-capacity free-space optical communication is fundamentally limited by atmospheric turbulence, a challenge that conventional mode-sorting techniques have failed to overcome. While engineered optical computers like diffractive networks offer a potential solution, their design complexity remains a significant barrier. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate a methodology for task-dependent hardware design, demonstrating a simple, continuous-wave-driven multimode fibre reservoir that is physically configured to solve this specific, high-impact problem. We first establish a set of physical design principles, showing that recurrent dynamics are optimal for structural data (MNIST), whereas high mode-mixing is superior for textural data (FMNIST). By treating turbulence-induced wavefront distortion as a complex textural feature, we configure a physically optimised reservoir for classifying orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. In moderate to high-turbulence regimes, our system outperforms an ideal modal decomposition by an average of 20.32~$\pm$~3.00\%, succeeding precisely where the conventional approach fails. This work not only demonstrates a practical, low-complexity solution for turbulence mitigation but also reframes the optical receiver as a physical likelihood processor, thereby offering a path towards significantly reduced digital signal processing burdens by offloading much of the computational load to the physical optical front-end. We establish a framework for co-designing physical hardware with computation, enabling simpler, more robust optical machine learning systems tailored for real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Optical Logic Gates and 2-Bit Decoder Using Multiport Directional Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a reconfigurable photonic platform capable of implementing both optical logic gates and a 2-bit decoder on the same device. The architecture is based on cascaded multiport directional couplers interleaved with thermo-optic phase shifters, enabling programmable $N \times N$ unitary transformations. Optimal heater voltages for phase control are determined through Bayesian optimization. The devices operate reliably across multiple wavelengths with 50 GHz spacing, suggesting potential for wavelength-parallel optical processing. These results highlight a pathway toward compact, programmable and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Path Control in High-Order Harmonic Generation via Squeezed Lights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG), a robust tabletop source for producing attosecond pulses, has been extensively utilized in attosecond metrology. Traditionally, HHG driven by classical laser fields involves two typical quantum paths (short and long quantum paths) contributing to harmonic emission. Here, we demonstrate that these quantum paths in HHG can be selectively controlled using squeezed lights, a form of non-classical light. Our results indicate that the long (short) quantum path of HHG will be dramatically suppressed in the phase (amplitude)-squeezed fields. The time-frequency analysis reveals that this quantum path control stems from the quantum fluctuations in the squeezed light, which modify the phase matching of harmonic emission from different quantum states of the squeezed light. Such a quantum path selection can be achieved for the whole harmonic plateau, which has great potential to generate ultrashort isolated attosecond pulse with duration less than one atomic unit of time.</description>

      <title>Nanoimprinted topological laser in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a widely used high-throughput fabrication technique for photonic devices, yet its reliability is often compromised by the inevitable imperfections that arise during the demolding process. Topological photonics, which harnesses topologically nontrivial structures to support defect-robust photonic states, offers a promising solution to this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a topological laser that is one-step nanoimprinted upon colloidal perovskite nanocrystals. This laser features multiple higher-order topological corner states, with topological protection provided by the structure effectively mitigating imperfections caused by the nanoimprinting process. This property enables the reliable detection of these states, which is particularly challenging to achieve in the visible spectrum. Our work establishes topological photonics as a viable pathway to enhance the reliability of NIL-based manufacturing, providing a scalable and practical route for mass-producing topological lasers with low-index materials.</description>

      <title>BIC slow light waveguides based on interband coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing bound states in the continuum (BICs) for guiding light in leaky environments has unlocked new possibilities in photonic integrated circuits. BIC confinement enables low-loss waveguiding of leaky transverse-magnetic (TM) modes in etchless waveguides based on dielectric wires loaded on plane slabs. We have recently reported BIC slow light waveguides by introducing one-dimensional photonic crystals into such etchless waveguides. However, they were restricted to a high-symmetry point ($X$ point), limiting their applicability. In this Letter, we propose and numerically demonstrate BIC slow light waveguides at off-high-symmetry points by exploiting Friedrich-Wintgen BICs, arising from the interband coupling of two guided modes sharing a radiation continuum. We identified a systematic approach for tuning the loss minimum position in momentum space and simultaneously achieved a high group index over $100$ and a low propagation loss of less than $5 \times 10^{-2}~\mathrm{dB/cm}$ at an off-high-symmetry point. Our findings pave the way for advanced control of light-matter interactions in non-Hermitian photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum spin-Hall topological lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quantum spin-Hall topological laser formed by an array of dielectric ring resonators endowed of saturable gain. The system preserves time-reversal symmetry, the clockwise and counter-clockwise modes in each ring resonator acting as two pseudospin states that experience opposite synthetic magnetic fields. We consider ring resonators featuring an internal S-shaped waveguide asymmetrically coupling the two pseudospin states. In spite of the non-magnetic nature of the configuration, we show that an effective breaking of reciprocity is induced by the interplay of spatial parity breaking with saturable gain and a Kerr optical non-linearity. This enables robust single-mode topological lasing even in the presence of realistic levels of backscattering.</description>

      <title>Observation of tuning properties in a doubly resonant backward optical parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly resonant optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) under continuous wave (CW) pumping are particularly notable for their low threshold and narrow linewidth. Backward OPOs (BOPOs) realized through backward quasi-phase matching which exhibit unique tuning properties compared with conventional forward OPOs have been demonstrated under pulse pumping. In this work, a doubly resonant BOPO was implemented in a semi-monolithic cavity under CW pumping, and its tuning properties were characterized. By tuning the pump wavelength, the forward and backward waves exhibited tuning ranges of 56.85 nm and 0.89 nm, respectively. Adjusting the crystal temperature resulted in tuning ranges of 59.7 GHz and 59.4 GHz for the forward and backward waves, respectively. This research establishes the BOPO as a promising candidate for applications in the field of CW OPOs.</description>

      <title>Short-wave infrared broadband up-conversion imaging by using a noncritical phase matched bulk KTiOPO$_4$ crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to cryogenically cooled conventional detectors, up-conversion detection enables efficient room-temperature short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging. Although quasi-phase-matching (QPM) in periodically poled crystals offers advantages, the small crystal aperture (typically 1 mm$\times$3 mm) limits resolution. Non-poled crystals enable larger apertures but suffer walk-off aberrations. This work overcomes these limitations by using a noncritical phase matched (NCPM) KTiOPO$_4$ crystal (6 mm$\times$7 mm aperture, 0.5 mm length). Results show resolutions 6$\times$ and 2$\times$ higher than periodically poled crystals in orthogonal directions, with broad conversion band (1.3-2.2 $\mu$m) covering biological and atmospheric windows. The absence of walk-off ensures better image fidelity in up-conversion process. This study presents the first comprehensive characterization of NCPM-based broadband up-conversion imaging, demonstrating performance at the theoretical resolution limit while circumventing drawbacks inherent in alternative up-conversion schemes and conventional detectors.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent emission patterns enabled by plasmonic nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective control over the emission pattern of valley-polarized excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides is crucial for developing novel valleytronic, quantum information, and optoelectronic devices. While significant progress has been made in directionally routing photoluminescence from these materials, key challenges remain: notably, how to link routing effects to the degree of valley polarization, and how to distinguish genuine valley-dependent routing from spin-momentum coupling - an optical phenomenon related to electromagnetic scattering but not the light source itself. In this study, we address these challenges by experimentally and numerically establishing a direct relationship between the intrinsic valley polarization of the emitters and the farfield emission pattern, enabling an accurate assessment of valley-selective emission routing. We report valley-selective manipulation of the angular emission pattern of monolayer tungsten diselenide mediated by gold nanobar dimer antennas at cryogenic temperature. Experimentally, we study changes in the system's emission pattern for different circular polarization states of the excitation, demonstrating a valley-selective circular dichroism in photoluminescence of 6%. These experimental findings are supported by a novel numerical approach based on the principle of reciprocity, which allows modeling valley-selective emission in periodic systems. We further show numerically, that these valley-selective directional effects are a symmetry-protected property of the nanoantenna array owing to its extrinsic chirality for oblique emission angles, and can significantly be enhanced when tailoring the distribution of emitters. This renders our nanoantenna-based system a robust platform for valleytronic processing.</description>

      <title>Design of efficient high-order immersed metagratings using an evolutionary algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersed reflection gratings improve spectral resolving power by enabling diffraction within a high refractive index medium. This principle has been widely adopted to make grating spectrometers more compact. Conventional immersed gratings have blazed profiles which typically show the highest efficiency for one main design wavelength. In addition, the blazed profiles tend to cause significant polarization sensitivity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for designing an immersed grating composed of sub-wavelength structures, designed to increase diffraction efficiency and reduce polarization dependence. For a theoretical demonstration, a reflective metagrating immersed in silicon is optimized over the short-wave infrared band-3 (SWIR-3, here $2.304~\mu$m-$2.405~\mu$m), targeting the same diffraction angles as the immersion grating used in the Sentinel-5 Earth observation mission. The structure is optimized using a modified Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The optimized immersed metagrating achieves an average efficiency of (over the SWIR-3 band) $\sim 78\%$, compared to $\sim 62\%$ for the conventional immersed blazed grating, and reduces polarization sensitivity from roughly $\sim 15\%$ to $\sim 5\%$. A manufacturing tolerance analysis is also conducted to evaluate the design's performance under systematic manufacturing errors, which revealed a degradation of $\sim 10\%$ efficiency at feature size errors of $\pm 25{nm}$ and almost negligible effect on the efficiency at $-10{nm}$ and of $\sim 5\%$ at $+10{nm}$.</description>

      <title>Tunable Resonant Metasurfaces Empowered by Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonics has recently gained new momentum with the emergence of a novel class of nanophotonic systems consisting of resonant dielectric nanostructures integrated with single or few layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs). Thinned to the single layer phase, 2D-TMDs are unique solid-state systems with excitonic states able to persist at room temperature and demonstrate notable tunability of their energies in the optical range. Based on these properties, they offer important opportunities for hybrid nanophotonic systems where a nanophotonic structure serves to enhance the light-matter interaction in the 2D-TMDs, while the 2D-TMDs can provide various active functionalities, thereby dramatically enhancing the scope of nanophotonic structures. In this work, we combine 2D-TMD materials with resonant photonic nanostructures, namely, metasurfaces composed of high-index dielectric nanoparticles. The dependence of the excitonic states on charge carrier density in 2D-TMDs leads to an amplitude modulation of the corresponding optical transitions upon changes of the Fermi level, and thereby to changes of the coupling strength between the 2D-TMDs and resonant modes of the photonic nanostructure. We experimentally implement such a hybrid nanophotonic system and demonstrate voltage tuning of its reflectance as well as its different polarization-dependent behavior. Our results show that hybridization with 2D-TMDs can serve to render resonant photonic nanostructures tunable and time-variant $-$ important properties for practical applications in optical analog computers and neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Wave morphing and flat-top ground states in photonics systems driven by artificial gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum physics, classical optics, and many other wave systems, wave confinement in a potential well produces is associated with discrete oscillatory states, and the ground state is typically assumed to vanish uniformly. An open question is whether the ground state can counterintuitively support a flat-top, nonzero envelope, offering new opportunities for quantum emitters, optical antennas, and lasers. Here, we show that by applying the Byers-Yang theorem with an artificial gauge field, energy levels can be continuously shifted, driving eigenstates to morph into a ground state with a uniform yet nontrivial wave envelope. We implement this concept in a photonic crystal slab where a central bulk region is surrounded by heterogeneous bandgaps that engineer reflective phases acting as an artificial local gauge field. By inducing lasing, we probe directly the evolution of the energy levels, demonstrating wave morphing toward a flat-top ground state via near- and far-field measurements.</description>

      <title>Single-shot, spatially resolved spectropolarimetry with stress engineered optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe, and test, a method of obtaining spectrally and spatially sampled Stokes polarimetry measurements based on star test polarimetry enabled by a stress engineered optic (SEO). When the SEO is placed in the pupil plane of an imaging system, the space-variant birefringence of the SEO combined with the intrinsic wavelength dependence of the retardance allows for point spread functions from distinct laser wavelengths to be both spectrally and polarimetrically distinguished in a single frame measurement designed to enable single shot spectropolarimetry of individual laser pulses. In the experiment, the beam is sampled using a lenslet array typical of that used in a Shack-Hartmann sensor with the PSF of each spot relayed to a sensor. Experiments show angular errors as small as 100 mRad on the Poincare sphere, with red and blue measurements outperforming green. Potential applications include polarization sampling of extreme lasers as well as spectropolarimetry of display devices based on liquid crystals.</description>

Abstract: We report a 100 kHz linewidth for the 1S0 to 3P1 intercombination line of 88Sr atoms at 689nm in a microfabricated 9x14 x4.4 mm3 vapor cell. This puts an upper bound on the residual gas pressure in the vapor cell of 10 mTorr. The microfabricatd Sr vapor cell offers an inexpensive and scalable way to lock lasers in state-of-the-art cold-atom based atomic clocks and quantum computing experiments. It also paves the way for a compact and precise optical frequency references based on alkaline earth vapor cells.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition method for computing the scattering matrix of waveguide circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze and develop numerical methods for time-harmonic wave scattering in metallic waveguide structures of infinite extent. We show that radiation boundary conditions formulated via projectors onto outgoing modes determine the coefficients of propagating modes uniquely, even when the structure supports trapped modes. Building on this, we introduce a fast divide-and-conquer solver that constructs solution operators on subdomains as impedance-to-impedance maps and couples them by enforcing continuity conditions across their interfaces. For Dirichlet waveguides, the computation of impedance-to-impedance maps requires the solution of mixed Dirichlet-Impedance boundary value problems. We construct a second-kind Fredholm integral equation that avoids near-hypersingular operators, requiring only integral operators whose kernels are at most weakly singular. Numerical experiments on large structures with many circuit elements demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: the proposed approach typically outperforms state-of-the-art fast iterative and fast direct solvers by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable optical trapping of thermophoretically active Janus colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states, described by Wigner quasi-probability distribution taking negative values, are of great interest for various applications of quantum physics. It is known however that they are highly vulnerable to dissipation. In this paper, we show that the robustness of the non-Gaussian states to losses can be significantly improved by pre-squeezing of the quantum state, and find the optimal parameters of the squeezing. As specific examples, we consider such well-known quantum states as Schrodinger cat, Fock , and ``banana'' ones.</description>

Abstract: Using real-space view of high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids, we develop a physically transparent and gauge-invariant approach for distinguishing intraband and interband HHG mechanisms. Our approach relies on resolving the harmonic emission according to the separation between Wannier states involved in radiative transitions. We show that the intra- and inter-band HHG emission exhibit striking qualitative differences in their dependence on this separation and can be clearly distinguished using the Wannier basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable photonic optimization holds the promise of significantly enhancing the performance of diffractive lenses across a wide range of photonic applications. However, the high computational cost of conventional full three-dimensional electromagnetic solvers has thus far been a major obstacle to large-scale-domain optimization. Here, we address this limitation by integrating the convergent Born series with the adjoint-field optimization framework, enabling inverse design with its domain size up to a $110 \times 110 \times 46\ \mu\text{m}^3$ volume$-$corresponding to 0.1 gigavoxels$-$using a single, cost-effective graphics card. The optimized lens achieves a 9% improvement in axial resolution and a 20% increase in focusing efficiency compared to a standard Fresnel lens of identical diameter and numerical aperture. These gains point to immediate application opportunities for optimizing high-performance microscopy, photolithography, and optical trapping systems using modest computational resources.</description>

      <title>Carrier Transport in Electrically-Driven Photonic Crystal Membrane Lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model carrier transport in photonic crystal lasers with lateral current injection through two-dimensional (2D) finite-volume simulations. Though such lasers can achieve ultra-low threshold currents, leakage paths reduce the carrier injection efficiency. The design is evaluated through its performance in terms of injection efficiency, internal quantum efficiency, and IV characteristics. Our model predicts the presence of unconventional leakage paths, explaining experimental observations of low injection efficiencies and enhanced spontaneous recombination at doping interfaces. Carrier leakage paths arise due to insufficient injection of holes into the active region, leading to an electric field that increases the energy barrier for electrons, thereby reducing the injection efficiency. The spatial profile of the p-doped region is shown to play a critical role in achieving a high electrical injection efficiency and low-threshold lasing. The model is an important step towards modelling and optimizing properties of 2D photonic crystal membrane lasers.</description>

      <title>Sub-femtosecond stabilization of multicore fiber for high-fidelity quantum networking at 100% duty cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally envisioned as a solution for the capacity crunch in telecommunications networks, multicore fibers (MCF) are contributing to scientific fields beyond telecom, such as sensing and metrology. Confined within the same cladding, the cores of MCF have a high degree of noise correlation which can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Here, we investigate MCF as a solution to the challenging problem of quantum and classical light co-existence in quantum networks by operating the quantum and stabilization light in separate but highly correlated cores of a 7-core MCF. Over 40 km of spooled fiber, we achieved 100 attosecond integrated jitter on one core by using phase information derived from another core. This allows for 100% duty cycle on a quantum channel while maintaining a low spurious photon rate from crosstalk between stabilization and quantum channels. With cycle-slip-free stabilization over 6 hours, frequency detuning between designated stabilization and quantum channels, and an additional 40 dB rejection of noise photons provided by the low optical crosstalk between cores, we achieved a Raman scattering-induced spurious photon rate of only 0.01 photons/s in 100 GHz bandwidth. Our results with MCF are a promising approach to ultra-stable quantum networks with 100% duty cycle on the quantum channel.</description>

      <title>Phase-Subtractive Interference and Noise-Resistant Quantum Imaging with Two Undetected Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum interference phenomenon in which four-photon quantum states generated by two independent sources are used to create a two-photon interference pattern without detecting two of the photons. Contrary to the common perception, the interference pattern can be made fully independent of phases acquired by the photons detected to construct it. However, it still contains information about spatially dependent phases acquired by the two undetected photons. This phenomenon can also be observed with fermionic particles. We show that the phenomenon can be applied to develop an interferometric, quantum phase imaging technique that is immune to uncontrollable phase fluctuations in the interferometer and allows image acquisition without detecting the photons illuminating the object.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17256</link>

Abstract: This paper theoretically investigates the manipulation of the Photonic Spin Hall Effect (photonic SHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in a cavity. The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable photonic SHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance under the condition of electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT), the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits photonic SHE similar to the CTL system, showing a maximum upper limit of photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist. This upper limit arises due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence photonic SHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence photonic SHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning photonic SHE. Finally, the results are equally valid and applicable to conventional $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity atomic systems. The results of angular photonic SHE are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution with Spatial Modes: From 360 to 5000-Dimensional Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22058</link>

Abstract: Here, we present a high-dimensional QKD protocol utilizing the position and momentum entanglement of photon pairs. The protocol exploits the fact that position and momentum form mutually unbiased bases, linked via a Fourier transform. One photon of the entangled pair is measured by the sender in a randomly chosen basis-either position or momentum - selected passively via a 50:50 beamsplitter. This projective measurement remotely prepares the partner photon in a corresponding spatial mode, which is sent to the receiver (Bob), who similarly performs a random measurement in one of the two basis. This approach combines state preparation and measurement into a single process, eliminating the need for external random number generators. In this proof-of-principle demonstration, we achieve a photon information efficiency of 5.07 bits per photon using 90 spatial modes, and a maximum bit rate of 0.9 Kb/s with 361 modes. Looking ahead, we theoretically show that using the same entangled photon source but with next-generation event-based cameras - featuring improved quantum efficiency, timing and spatial resolution - our approach could achieve 10.9 bits per photon at 2500 spatial modes, and a maximum bit rate of 3.1 Mb/s with 5100 modes. This work establishes a scalable path toward high-dimensional, spatially encoded quantum communication with both high photon efficiency and secure bit rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Spanner: Twisting Superconductors with Vortex Beam via Higgs Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--known as vortex beams--has broadened the scope of understanding and applications of light's angular momentum. Optical tweezers using OAM, often referred to as optical spanners, have significantly expanded the tunability of optical manipulation. A key frontier now lies in understanding how vortex beams interact with quantum states of matter. In this work, we numerically investigate the dynamics of a superconductor under vortex beam illumination and demonstrate the transfer of angular momentum from light to the superconducting collective mode, resulting in mechanical rotation. Our findings open a pathway for optical manipulation in the quantum regime, which we term the quantum optical spanner.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mirrorless Superradiant Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict collective 'free-space' lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator. At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.</description>
