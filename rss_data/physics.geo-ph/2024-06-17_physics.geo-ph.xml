      <title>Nowcasting Earthquakes with "QuakeGPT": A Generative Earthquake Pretrained Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake nowcasting has been proposed as a means of tracking the change in large earthquake potential in a seismically active area. The method was developed using observable seismic data, in which probabilities of future large earthquakes can be computed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) methods. Furthermore, analysis of the Shannon information content of the earthquake catalogs has been used to show that there is information contained in the catalogs, and that it can vary in time. Here we discuss a new method for earthquake nowcasting that uses an AI-enhanced deep learning model "QuakeGPT" that is based on an attention-based science transformer adapted for time series forecasting. Such dot product attention-based transformers were introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), and are the basis for the new large language models such as ChatGPT. To use these science transformers, they must first be trained on a large corpus of data. A problem is that the existing history of reliable earthquake catalog data extends back in time only a few decades, which is almost certainly too short to train a model for reliable nowcasting/forecasting. As a result, we turn to earthquake simulations to train the transformer model. Specifically we discuss a simple stochastic earthquake simulation model "ERAS" that has recently been introduced. The ERAS model is similar to the more common "ETAS" models, the difference being that the ERAS model has only 2 novel, adjustable parameters, rather than the 6-8 adjustable parameters that characterize most ETAS models. Using this ERAS model, we then define a transformer model and train it using a long catalog of ERAS simulations, then apply it to an ERAS validation dataset with the transformer model. In this paper, we describe this new method and assess the applicability to observed earthquake catalogs for use in nowcasting/forecasting.</description>

      <title>Mild-to-wild plasticity of Earth's upper mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of Earth's upper mantle has long been considered to occur by slow and near-continuous creep. Such behaviour is observed in classical high-temperature deformation experiments and is a fundamental component of geodynamic models. However, the latest generation of high-resolution experiments, capable of sensing temporal heterogeneities in rates of dislocation motion, have revealed that materials ranging from metals to ice exhibit a spectrum of behaviours termed mild-to-wild plasticity. It remains unknown whether olivine, the most abundant mineral in Earth's upper mantle, always exhibits mild continuous flow or can exhibit intermittent wild fluctuations in plastic strain rate. Here, we demonstrate that olivine exhibits measurable wildness, even under conditions at which its behaviour is predicted to be relatively mild. During nanoindentation experiments conducted at room temperature, continuous plastic flow is punctuated by intermittent bursts of displacement with log-normally distrubuted magnitudes, indicating avalanches of correlated dislocation motion that account for approximately 8 +/- 6% of the plastic strain. Remarkably, the framework of mild-to-wild plasticity predicts that wildness should increase with depth in the Earth, with flow of the asthenospheric upper mantle occurring almost entirely by wild fluctuations of deformation at the grain scale. The recognition of intermittent plasticity in geological materials provides new constraints for microphysical models of dislocation-mediated flow and raises questions about the mehcanisms of transient instabilities in otherwise ductile regimes, such as deep earthquakes and slow-slip events.</description>

      <title>Energetics of particle-size segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a continuum framework for the energetics of particle-size segregation in bidisperse granular flows. Building on continuum segregation equations and a recent segregation flux model, the proposed framework offers general analytical expressions to study the physics of granular flows from a mechanical energy perspective. To demonstrate the framework's applicability, we examined the energetics in shear-driven flows. Numerical experiments with varying frictional coefficients and particle-size ratios revealed two distinct phases in the associated energetics with particle segregation and diffusive remixing, and that the potential energy to the kinetic energy ratio in the steady state follows the scaling relationship $\hat{E}^{(s)}_{gp} / \hat{E}^{(s)}_{k} \propto Pe^{-1/2}_{sr}$ for $0.4 \leq Pe_{sr} \leq 300$, the segregation-rheology P\'eclet number. Our findings hint that the bulk segregation-mixing state can be predicted and controlled using $Pe_{sr}$, determined from known system parameters, providing a impactful tool for engineering and geophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks and Friction: Slide, Hold, Learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, it is demonstrated that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically those utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture, possess the capability to learn the complex dynamics of rate-and-state friction laws from synthetic data. The data employed for training the network is generated through the application of traditional rate-and-state friction equations coupled with the aging law for state evolution. A novel aspect of our approach is the formulation of a loss function that explicitly accounts for the direct effect by means of automatic differentiation. It is found that the RNN, with its GRU architecture, effectively learns to predict changes in the friction coefficient resulting from velocity jumps (with and without noise in the target data), thereby showcasing the potential of machine learning models in understanding and simulating the physics of frictional processes.</description>

      <title>Gemini &amp; Physical World: Large Language Models Can Estimate the Intensity of Earthquake Shaking from Multi-Modal Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to extract scientifically valuable information about Earth's physical phenomena from unconventional sources, such as multi-modal social media posts. Employing a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), Gemini 1.5 Pro (Reid et al. 2024), we estimate earthquake ground shaking intensity from these unstructured posts. The model's output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, aligns well with independent observational data. Furthermore, our results suggest that LLMs, trained on vast internet data, may have developed a unique understanding of physical phenomena. Specifically, Google's Gemini models demonstrate a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, accurately describing observational data even though it's not identical to established models. These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent to which Gemini's training has led to a broader understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The ability of Generative AI models like Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights their potential to augment our understanding of complex physical phenomena like earthquakes. The flexible and effective approach proposed in this study holds immense potential for enriching our understanding of the impact of physical phenomena and improving resilience during natural disasters. This research is a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for natural disaster mitigation, opening new avenues for understanding the emerging capabilities of Generative AI and LLMs for scientific applications.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic-elliptic PDE model and conservative numerical method for gravity-dominated variably-saturated groundwater flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Richards equation is often used to represent two-phase fluid flow in an unsaturated porous medium when one phase is much heavier and more viscous than the other. However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow for some capillary functions without specialized treatment due to degeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-dominated variably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to elliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts introduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In this work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical model and implement a well-known efficient and conservative numerical method for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary forces. The elliptic problem in saturated regions is integrated efficiently into our framework by solving a reduced system corresponding only to the saturated cells using fixed head boundary conditions in the unsaturated cells. In summary, this coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient, physics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully saturated regions. Finally, we provide a suite of easy-to-implement yet challenging benchmark test problems involving saturated flows in one and two dimensions. These simple problems, accompanied by their corresponding analytical solutions, can prove to be pivotal for the code verification, model validation (V&amp;V) and performance comparison of simulators for variably saturated flow. Our numerical solutions show an excellent comparison with the analytical results for the proposed problems. The last test problem on two-dimensional infiltration in a stratified, heterogeneous soil shows the formation and evolution of multiple disconnected saturated regions.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Edge Correspondence Recovered in Incompressible Geophysical Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence is a cornerstone in topological physics, establishing a connection between the number of unidirectional edge modes in physical space and a Chern number, an integer that counts phase singularities of the eigenmodes in parameter space. In continuous media, violation of this correspondence has been reported when some of the frequency wavebands are unbounded, resulting in weak topological protection of chiral edge states. Here, we propose a strategy to reestablish strong bulk-edge correspondence in incompressible rotating stratified flows, taking advantage of a natural cutoff frequency provided by density stratification. The key idea involves the introduction of an auxiliary field to handle the divergence-free constraint. This approach highlights the resilience of internal coastal Kelvin waves near vertical walls under varying boundary conditions.</description>
