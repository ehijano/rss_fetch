      <title>Piercing soft solids: A mechanical theory for needle insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the mechanical problem of piercing a soft solid body with a needle. This phenomenon is controlled by the critical condition of needle insertion. Needle insertion involves physical and geometrical nonlinearities and a complex failure mechanism. To overcome the complexity of the problem, we describe needle insertion as a sharp transition between two needle-specimen configurations, namely "indentation" and "penetration". The sharp configurational change emerges from a mechanical instability and follows the principle of energy minimum. We describe the needle-specimen system in terms of the force applied to the back of the needle and the axial displacement of the needle tip toward the material. At small needle displacements, the energetically favoured configuration is indentation. Conversely, when the needle displaces beyond a critical threshold, it penetrates the specimen by rupturing its surface. This creates a new energetically favoured configuration: penetration. Our analysis considers a cylindrical needle with a spherical tip, neglects friction and adhesion between the needle and the material, and assumes quasi-static conditions. Despite the mathematical simplicity of our analysis, our theoretical predictions on the needle insertion force have been validated against experiments with surprising accuracy. Our method provides an effective predictive tool, which can be extended to account for different indenter geometry and material behaviour.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised classification of disordered phases in an oppositely charged colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify disordered phases in a system of oppositely charged colloids. In this system, the interplay between Coulomb and van der Waals interactions leads to transitions in local structures, while the global structure remains disordered. Our method involves representing the local structures of the system as high-dimensional vectors and applying principal component analysis to identify distinct features of each phase. We demonstrate that our method results in a reasonable classification of disordered phases, which is consistent with that obtained from radial distribution functions. The interpretability of the method reveals the key characteristics of each phase and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the unconventional phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Phase behavior of hard sheared cube family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sheared cube is made out of a cube by giving a shear to the body in one direction keeping one of the faces fixed. We investigate here the thermodynamic phase behavior of a family of such regular hard sheared cubes, each of the members of the family having a distinct angle made by the faces with the perpendicular on the fixed face. Hard particle Monte Carlo (HPMC) has been performed with these anisotropic building blocks resulting entropy-driven self assembly. Thereby computational evidence of discrete plastic crystal phase has been found in crystal. The discrete plastic crystal phase is known to form through the spontaneous self-assembly of certain polyhedra. Throughout the entire solid regime particle orientations exhibit strong specific correlations before melting into a liquid, without any evidence of freely rotating plastic crystal at lower density solid. It has been thoroughly observed that geometrical attributes of the shapes don't determine any of the properties that designate this orientational disorder phase reported here. We also find that particle's rotational symmetric axes and one of the rotational symmetric axes of the unit cell of the crystal have a strong relationship in their alignment in space. These results, achieved with shapes having crystallographic point group symmetry, are investigated as being consistent with the phenomenology of discrete plastic crystal phase established in earlier works with hard particles having non-crystallographic point group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Impact of Mixing on Flavor and Aroma Development in Fermented Foods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavor and aroma development in fermented foods is intricately tied to the mixing dynamics during fermentation. This review explores how variations in mixing influence the physical, chemical, and microbial interactions within fermentation systems, ultimately affecting sensory characteristics such as flavor and aroma. Factors like rheology, shear forces, and fluid flow patterns are critical in mass transfer, microbial activity, and the release of volatile compounds, contributing to fermented products' sensory profile. Examples from common fermented foods -- including bread, yogurt, beer, wine, and cheese -- highlight how controlled mixing can optimize the release of desirable flavor compounds, improve biosynthesis yields, and reduce technological complexity. Understanding these physical interactions is essential for advancing fermentation processes in the food industry, leading to higher product quality, better flavor retention, and enhanced consumer satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Universality of extreme events in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of small scales, a cornerstone of turbulence, has been nominally confirmed for low-order mean-field statistics, such as the energy spectrum. However, small scales exhibit strong intermittency, exemplified by formation of extreme events which deviate anomalously from a mean-field description. Here, we investigate the universality of small scales by analyzing extreme events of velocity gradients in different turbulent flows, viz. direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, inhomogeneous channel flow, and laboratory measurements in a von Karman mixing tank. We demonstrate that the scaling exponents of velocity gradient moments, as function of Reynolds number ($Re$), are universal, in agreement with previous studies at lower $Re$, and further show that even proportionality constants are universal when considering one moment order as a function of another. Additionally, by comparing various unconditional and conditional statistics across different flows, we demonstrate that the structure of the velocity gradient tensor is also universal. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence that even extreme events are universal, with profound implications for turbulence theory and modeling.</description>

      <title>Instabilities of ring-rivulets: Impact of substrate wettability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rivulets and droplets are naturally appearing shapes when small amounts of liquid are deposited on a partially wettable substrate. Here we study, by means of numerical simulations, the dewetting dynamics of a ring-rivulet on substrates with various contact angles and wettability patterns. In particular, we consider, beyond the homogeous case, an annular band of lower contact angle as compared to the background and a constant radial gradient of contact angle, pointing either inward or outward from the centre. We show that by tuning the parameters characterizing the patterns, it is possible to control not only the stability of the rivulet, i.e. its breakup/collapse dynamics and the associated time scales, but also the dewetting morphology, in terms of number and position of the formed droplets.</description>

      <title>Pinned Ad-colloids Disfavors Nucleation in Colloidal Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystallization through vapor deposition is ubiquitous, and is inevitably influenced by impurities, which often impact the local structure. Interestingly, the effect of immobilizing some of the depositing particles themselves, which would still preserve local structural symmetry, remains largely unexplored. Herein, we perform colloidal vapor deposition on a substrate with a few pinned ad-colloids, termed "mobility impurities". Through thermodynamic and kinematic measurements, we demonstrate that these pinned ad-colloids, even though they share identical geometry and interaction with depositing particles, are disfavored as nucleation centers. We reveal that entropic contributions, rather than energetic ones, govern nucleation physics in the presence of mobility impurities. Moreover, tuning the mobility of colloids on the substrate adjusts the nucleation likelihood at pinned sites. In later stages of growth, pinning induces mode localization and alters the thin film's vibrational spectrum. Our work, thus, underscores the potential of strategically incorporating mobility impurities to engineer material properties.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of adhesion strength through microvibrations: modeling and experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency micrometrical vibrations have been shown to greatly influence the adhesive performance of soft interfaces, however a detailed comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results is still missing. Here, the problem of a rigid spherical indenter, hung on a soft spring, that is unloaded from an adhesive viscoelastic vibrating substrate is considered. The experimental tests were performed by unloading a borosilicate glass lens from a soft PDMS substrate excited by high-frequency micrometrical vibrations. We show that as soon as the vibration starts, the contact area increases abruptly and during unloading it decreases following approximately the JKR classical model, but with a much increased work of adhesion. We find that the pull-off force increases with respect to the amplitude of vibration up to a certain saturation level, which appeared to be frequency dependent. Under the hypothesis of short range adhesion, a lumped mechanical model was derived, which, starting from an independent characterization of the rate-dependent interfacial adhesion, predicted qualitatively and quantitatively the experimental results, without the need of any adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>Forces from coarse-graining nonequilibrium degrees of freedom: exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relaxation dynamics of a tracer in a harmonic trap coupled to a non-equilibrium bath particle in stationary state, finding qualitative differences compared to the well known equilibrium case. These can be attributed to an additional position and time dependent force acting on the tracer, emerging when averaging the bath degree in the non-equilibrium stationary state conditioned to a certain tracer position. Specifically, we provide analytical results for an overdamped tracer coupled linearly to a bath particle in different nonequilibrium scenarios, namely, subjected to a different temperature than the tracer, or to active noise with Gaussian or non-Gaussian fluctuations. For the case of different temperatures, the conditioned tracer-bath force can be as large in magnitude as the force from the trapping potential. For an active bath particle with memory, even the bath noise takes a finite average under conditioning of the tracer. Further, if the noise of the bath particle is non-Gaussian, the relaxation function of the tracer can be non-monotonic as a function of time. We also compute the \emph{pinned relaxation}, proposing that measurement and comparison of conditioned and pinned relaxation allows determination of the non-equilibrium forces in experiments.</description>

      <title>Elephant trunk wrinkles: A mathematical model of function and form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A notable feature of the elephant trunk is the pronounced wrinkling that enables its great flexibility. Here, we devise a general mathematical model that accounts for the characteristic skin wrinkles formed during morphogenesis in the elephant trunk. Using physically realistic parameters and operating within the theoretical framework of nonlinear morphoelasticity, we elucidate analytically and numerically the effect of skin thickness, relative stiffness, and differential growth on the physiological pattern of transverse wrinkles distributed along the trunk. We conclude that since the skin and muscle components have similar material properties, geometric parameters, such as curvature, play an important role. In particular, our model predicts that, in the proximal region close to the skull, where the curvature is lower, fewer wrinkles form and will form sooner than in the distal narrower region, where more wrinkles develop. Similarly, less wrinkling is found on the ventral side, which is flatter, compared to the dorsal side. In summary, the mechanical compatibility between the skin and the muscle enables them to grow seamlessly, while the wrinkled skin acts as a protective barrier that is both thicker and more flexible than the unwrinkled skin.</description>
