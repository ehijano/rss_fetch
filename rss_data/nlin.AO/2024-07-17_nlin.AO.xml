      <title>Global bifurcations organizing weak chimeras in three symmetrically coupled Kuramoto oscillators with inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency desynchronized attractors cannot appear in identically coupled symmetric phase oscillators because "overtaking" of phases cannot occur. This restriction no longer applies for more general identically coupled oscillators. Hence, it is interesting to understand precisely how frequency synchrony is lost and how invariant sets such as attracting weak chimeras are generated at torus breakup, where the phase description breaks down. Maistrenko et al (2016) found numerical evidence of an organizing center for weak chimeras in a system of $N=3$ coupled identical Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. This paper identifies this organizing center and shows that it corresponds to a particular type of non-transverse heteroclinic bifurcation that is generic in the context of symmetry. At this codimension two bifurcation there is a splitting of connecting orbits between the in-phase (fully synchronized) state. This generates a wide variety of associated bifurcations to weak chimeras. We further highlight a second organizing center associated with a codimension two symmetry-breaking heteroclinic connection.</description>

      <title>Searching for long time scales without fine tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of animal and human behavior occurs on time scales much longer than the response times of individual neurons. In many cases it is plausible that these long time scales emerge from the recurrent dynamics of electrical activity in networks of neurons. In linear models, time scales are set by the eigenvalues of a dynamical matrix whose elements measure the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons. It is not clear to what extent these matrix elements need to be tuned in order to generate long time scales; in some cases, one needs not just a single long time scale but a whole range. Starting from the simplest case of random symmetric connections, we combine maximum entropy and random matrix theory methods to construct ensembles of networks, exploring the constraints required for long time scales to become generic. We argue that a single long time scale can emerge generically from realistic constraints, but a full spectrum of slow modes requires more tuning. Langevin dynamics that will generate patterns of synaptic connections drawn from these ensembles involve a combination of Hebbian learning and activity-dependent synaptic scaling.</description>

      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Bio-Silicon Intelligence System: Integrating Hybrid Systems, Biocomputing, Neural Networks, and Machine Learning, for Advanced Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Bio-Silicon Intelligence System (BSIS), an innovative hybrid platform that integrates biological neural networks with silicon-based computing. The BSIS employs carbon nanotube-coated electrodes to interface rat brains with computational systems, enabling high-fidelity neural interfacing and bidirectional communication through self-organizing systems in both biological and silicon forms. Our system leverages both analogue and digital AI theory, incorporating concepts from chaos theory, dynamical systems theory, physics, and quantum mechanics. Neural signals are read through the FreeEEG32 board and BrainFlow software, then features are extracted and mapped to game actions by tracking feature changes in continuous data. Metadata is encoded into both analogue and digital brain stimulation signals at the microvolt level using our proprietary software. The system employs a dual signaling approach for training the rat brain, incorporating a reward solution and human-inaudible distress sounds. This paper details the design, functionality, and technical specifications of the BSIS, highlighting its interdisciplinary approach and advanced technological integration.</description>
