      <title>On a Generating Function for the Isotropic Basis Functions and Other Connected Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently isotropic basis functions of $N$ unit vector arguments were presented; these are of significant use in measuring the N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) of galaxy clustering. Here we develop the generating function for these basis functions -- i.e. that function which, expanded in a power series, has as its angular part the isotropic functions. We show that this can be developed using basic properties of the plane wave. A main use of the generating function is as an efficient route to obtaining the Cartesian basis expressions for the isotropic functions. We show that the methods here enable computing difficult overlap integrals of multiple spherical Bessel functions, and we also give related expansions of the Dirac Delta function into the isotropic basis. Finally, we outline how the Cartesian expressions for the isotropic basis functions might be used to enable a faster NPCF algorithm on the CPU.</description>

      <title>cp3-bench: A tool for benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms tested with cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a benchmark study of ten symbolic regression algorithms applied to cosmological datasets. We find that the dimension of the feature space as well as precision of datasets are highly important for symbolic regression tasks to be successful. We find no indication that inter-dependence of features in datasets are particularly important, meaning that it is not an issue if datasets e.g. contain both $z$ and $H(z)$ as features. We find no indication that performance of algorithms on standardized datasets are good indications of performance on cosmological datasets. This suggests that it is not necessarily prudent to choose which symbolic regressions algorithm to use based on their performance on standardized data. Instead, a more prudent approach is to consider a variety of algorithms. Overall, we find that most of the benched algorithms do rather poorly in the benchmark and suggest possible ways to proceed with developing algorithms that will be better at identifying ground truth expressions for cosmological datasets. As part of this publication we introduce our benchmark algorithm cp3-bench which we make publicly available at https://github.com/CP3-Origins/cp3-bench. The philosophy behind cp3-bench is that is should be as user-friendly as possible, available in a ready-to-use format, and allow for easy additions of new algorithms and datasets.</description>

      <title>Rocket Exhaust Blowing Soil in Near Vacuum Conditions is Faster than Predicted by Continuum Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments were performed to study how rocket exhaust blows soil in lunar and Martian conditions. Jets of gas were blown downwardly at various granular materials while a camera recorded the formation of scour holes as the material was removed. The experiments were performed in a series of conditions ranging from ambient 101 kPa pressure down to 0.3 kPa. This includes the range that is relevant for lunar conditions, because it is not hard vacuum inside the rocket exhaust where soil is being eroded. Prior work in ambient conditions showed that erosion rate is proportional to the square of the densimetric Froude number. However, the prior work was not performed at low pressures. In the new work, preliminary results show that as the gas density is so low that gas flow around the sand grains is no longer in the continuum regime, then erosion rate is faster than predicted by the earlier results. The dependency of erosion rate on various parameters is determined, but it turns out to be more complex than expected so additional experimental work will be required to develop complete scaling relationships.</description>

      <title>Caustics: A Python Package for Accelerated Strong Gravitational Lensing Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the deflection of light rays due to the gravity of intervening masses. This phenomenon is observed in a variety of scales and configurations, involving any non-uniform mass such as planets, stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and even the large scale structure of the universe. Strong lensing occurs when the distortions are significant and multiple images of the background source are observed. The lens objects must align on the sky of order ~1 arcsecond for galaxy-galaxy lensing, or 10's of arcseonds for cluster-galaxy lensing. As the discovery of lens systems has grown to the low thousands, these systems have become pivotal for precision measurements and addressing critical questions in astrophysics. Notably, they facilitate the measurement of the Universe's expansion rate, dark matter, supernovae, quasars, and the first stars among other topics. With future surveys expected to discover hundreds of thousands of lensing systems, the modelling and simulation of such systems must occur at orders of magnitude larger scale then ever before. Here we present `caustics`, a Python package designed to handle the extensive computational demands of modeling such a vast number of lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Rapid multi-band space-based optical timing: revolutionizing accretion physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical timing with rapid, seconds-to-minutes cadences with high photometric precision and gap-free long baselines is necessary for an unambiguous physical picture of accretion phenomena, and is only possible from space. Exoplanet-hunting missions like Kepler and TESS have offered an outstanding new window into detailed jet and accretion physics, but have been severely hampered by incomplete calibration and systematics treatments and, most especially, a monochromatic single wide bandpass. Advances made using Kepler and TESS survey data, when considered alongside detailed, expensive multi-color experiments done from the ground, reveal the enormous potential of a space-based multi-color optical timing mission with a high energy focus.</description>

      <title>CONCERTO at APEX -- On-sky performance in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the data-processing algorithms and the performance of CONCERTO (CarbON CII line in post-rEionisation and ReionisaTiOn epoch) in continuum by analysing the data from the commissioning and scientific observations. The beam pattern is characterized by an effective FWHM of 31.9 $\pm$ 0.6" and 34.4 $\pm$ 1.0" for high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) bands. The main beam is slightly elongated with a mean eccentricity of 0.46. Two error beams of $\sim$65" and $\sim$130" are characterized, enabling the estimate of a main beam efficiency of $\sim$0.52. The field of view is accurately reconstructed and presents coherent distortions between the HF and LF arrays. LEKID parameters were robustly determined for 80% of the read tones. Cross-talks between LEKIDs are the first cause of flagging, followed by an excess of eccentricity for $\sim$10% of the LEKIDs, all located in a given region of the field of view. On the 44 scans of Uranus selected for the absolute photometric calibration, 72.5% and 78.2% of the LEKIDs are selected as valid detectors with a probability &gt;70%. By comparing Uranus measurements with a model, we obtain calibration factors of 19.5$\pm$0.6 [Hz/Jy] and 25.6$\pm$0.9 [Hz/Jy] for HF and LF. The point-source continuum measurement uncertainties are 3.0% and 3.4% for HF and LF bands. The RMS of CONCERTO maps is verified to evolve as proportional to the inverse square root of integration time. The measured NEFDs for HF and LF are 115$\pm$2 mJy/beam$\cdot$s$^{1/2}$ and 95$\pm$1 mJy/beam$\cdot$s$^{1/2}$, obtained using CONCERTO data on the COSMOS field for a mean precipitable water vapour and elevation of 0.81 mm and 55.7 deg. CONCERTO demonstrates unique capabilities in fast dual-band spectral mapping with a $\sim$18.5' instantaneous field-of-view. CONCERTO's performance in continuum is perfectly in line with expectations.</description>

      <title>Design for Enabling Echelle and OMR Spectrograph Observations for Point and Extended Sources on the Same Night at VBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2.34m Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) is a reflecting telescope that operates in two modes, prime focus and cassegrain focus, and is equipped with two instruments. In prime focus mode, the telescope has the F-number of f/3.25, and the High-Resolution Echelle Spectrograph (HRES) is employed through optical fiber. On the other hand, in cassegrain focus mode, the F-number is f/13, and the OMR Spectrograph (OMRS) is mounted for low and medium-resolution spectroscopy. Currently, the VBT faces a limitation: either the OMRS or the HRES can be used due to the switch in the heavy secondary mirror. To overcome this, we present a novel method enabling the OMRS to operate from prime mode alongside the HRES. The fiber setup for OMRS is optimized with a 25-lenslet + fiber-based Integral Field Unit (IFU) capable of observing both point and extended sources. The optimized lenslet, fiber, and fore optics design is undergoing lab testing. Our approach allows seamless operation of both spectrographs on the same night, enhancing the observational capabilities of astronomical studies with VBT.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Fiber Arrangements for Improved Coupling Efficiency in the VBT High-Resolution Echelle Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fiber-based spectroscopy within telescopes, a prevailing limitation has been the necessity to align the fiber diameter with the telescope's seeing conditions, often characterized by the Full Width at Half Maximum of the point spread function. This alignment constraint captures around 50 \% of the incoming flux from any point source. Furthermore, the challenge is compounded when high-resolution spectroscopy is in play, as it often demands a minute slit width, further exacerbating flux loss. The essence of this paper lies in a comprehensive exploration, accomplished through theoretical simulations, of strategies aimed at enhancing the coupling efficiency of high-resolution spectrographs. The primary objective is to bolster the flux capture without compromising the critical aspect of spectral resolution. This research endeavors to unlock the potential for more effective utilization of high-resolution spectrographs to study celestial objects.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Deployment of the observatory control system and supporting infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) observatory consisting of three small aperture telescopes and one large aperture telescope. SO is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile at an elevation of 5180m. Distributed among the four telescopes are over 60,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers across six spectral bands centered between 27 and 280 GHz. A large collection of ancillary hardware devices which produce lower rate `housekeeping' data are used to support the detector data collection.
  We developed a distributed control system, which we call the observatory control system (ocs), to coordinate data collection among all systems within the observatory. ocs is a core component of the deployed site software, interfacing with all on-site hardware. Alongside ocs we utilize a combination of internally and externally developed open source projects to enable remote monitoring, data management, observation coordination, and data processing.
  Deployment of a majority of the software is done using Docker containers. The deployment of software packages is partially done via automated Ansible scripts, utilizing a GitOps based approach for updating infrastructure on site. We describe an overview of the software and computing systems deployed within SO, including how those systems are deployed and interact with each other. We also discuss the timing distribution system and its configuration as well as lessons learned during the deployment process and where we plan to make future improvements.</description>

      <title>The FRB-searching pipeline of the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, calibration, and survey strategy of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) digital backend and its real-time data processing pipeline employed in the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder array. The array, consisting of three parallel cylindrical reflectors and equipped with 96 dual-polarization feeds, is a radio interferometer array designed for conducting drift scans of the northern celestial semi-sphere. The FRB digital backend enables the formation of 96 digital beams, effectively covering an area of approximately 40 square degrees with 3 dB beam. Our pipeline demonstrates the capability to make automatic search of FRBs, detecting at quasi-real-time and classify FRB candidates automatically. The current FRB searching pipeline has an overall recall rate of 88\%. During the commissioning phase, we successfully detected signals emitted by four well-known pulsars: PSR B0329+54, B2021+51, B0823+26, and B2020+28. We report the first discovery of an FRB by our array, designated as FRB 20220414A. We also investigate the optimal arrangement for the digitally formed beams to achieve maximum detection rate by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Extraction of binary neutron star gravitational wave waveforms from Einstein Telescope using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the future, the third generation (3G) gravitational wave (GW) detectors, exemplified by the Einstein Telescope (ET), will be operational. The detection rate of GW from binary neutron star (BNS) is expected to reach approximately $10^4$ per year. To address the challenges posed by BNS GW data processing for 3G GW detectors, this paper explores the extraction of BNS waveforms from ET. Drawing inspiration from SPIIR's matched filtering approach, we introduce a novel framework leveraging deep learning for BNS waveform extraction. By integrating denoised outputs of time-delayed strain, we can reconstruct the embedded BNS waveform. We have established three distinct BNS GW denoising models, each tailored to address the early inspiral, later inspiral, and merger phases of BNS GW, respectively. To further regulate the waveform shape, we propose the Amplitude Regularity Model that takes denoised output as input and regulated waveform as output. The experiments conducted on test data demonstrate the efficacy of the denoising models, the Amplitude Regularity Models, as well as the overall waveform construction method. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first instance of deep learning being utilized for the task of BNS waveform extraction. We believe that the proposed method holds promise for early warning, searching, and localization of BNS GWs.</description>

      <title>Comparing sampling techniques to chart parameter space of 21 cm Global signal with Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the first billion years of the universe requires studying two critical epochs: the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD). However, due to limited data, the properties of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) during these periods remain poorly understood, leading to a vast parameter space for the global 21cm signal. Training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a narrowly defined parameter space can result in biased inferences. To mitigate this, the training dataset must be uniformly drawn from the entire parameter space to cover all possible signal realizations. However, drawing all possible realizations is computationally challenging, necessitating the sampling of a representative subset of this space. This study aims to identify optimal sampling techniques for the extensive dimensionality and volume of the 21cm signal parameter space. The optimally sampled training set will be used to train the ANN to infer from the global signal experiment. We investigate three sampling techniques: random, Latin Hypercube (stratified), and Hammersley Sequence (quasi-Monte Carlo) sampling, and compare their outcomes. Our findings reveal that sufficient samples must be drawn for robust and accurate ANN model training, regardless of the sampling technique employed. The required sample size depends primarily on two factors: the complexity of the data and the number of free parameters. More free parameters necessitate drawing more realizations. Among the sampling techniques utilized, we find that ANN models trained with Hammersley Sequence sampling demonstrate greater robustness compared to those trained with Latin Hypercube and Random sampling.</description>

      <title>The CRS: a scalable full-stack control system for Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The t0.technology Control and Readout System (CRS) is a modular microwave control and readout system for mm-wave and radio astronomy, THz imaging, noise radar, and superconducting qubit control. The configuration discussed in this work implements firmware for readout of microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) arrays. The CRS can operate 4,096 KIDs over 2.5 GHz of complex bandwidth between 0-10 GHz, typically allocated across four independent RF chains at 1,024x multiplexing and 625 MHz of complex bandwidth each. Every CRS can operate as a standalone unit or collectively within one or more backplane-enabled subracks that distribute power, clocking, and synchronization, scaling to an arbitrary number of channels. Each fully populated subrack supports arrays of more than 65,000 KIDs. The signal processing and control software supports recent innovations in multi-probe measurements and dynamic feedback modes, which are described in (Rouble et al. 2024). The CRS has recently been selected as the new baseline readout system for the proposed South Pole Telescope instrument, SPT-3G+.

      <title>CONCERTO: Instrument model of Fourier transform spectroscopy, white-noise components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern astrophysics relies on intricate instrument setups to meet the demands of sensitivity, sky coverage, and multi-channel observations. An example is the CONCERTO project, employing advanced technology like kinetic inductance detectors and a Martin-Puplett interferometer. This instrument, installed at the APEX telescope atop the Chajnantor plateau, began commissioning observations in April 2021. Following a successful commissioning phase that concluded in June 2021, CONCERTO was offered to the scientific community for observations, with a final observing run in December 2022. CONCERTO boasts an 18.5 arcmin field of view and a spectral resolution down to 1.45 GHz in the 130-310 GHz electromagnetic band. We developed a comprehensive instrument model of CONCERTO inspired by Fourier transform spectrometry principles to optimize performance and address systematic errors. This model integrates instrument noises, subsystem characteristics, and celestial signals, leveraging both physical data and simulations. Our methodology involves delineating simulation components, executing on-sky simulations, and comparing results with real observations. The resulting instrument model is pivotal, enabling a precise error correction and enhancing the reliability of astrophysical insights obtained from observational data. In this work, we focus on the description of three white-noise noise components included in the instrument model that characterize the white-noise level: the photon, the generation-recombination, and the amplifier noises.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the 7-Dimensional Telescope: Commissioning Procedures and Data Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT) is a multi-telescope system designed to identify electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Consisting of 20 50-cm telescopes along with 40 medium-band filters of 25 nm width, 7DT can obtain spectral mapping images for a large field of view (~1.25 square degrees). Along with flexible operation, real-time data reduction, and analysis, the 7DT's spectral mapping capability enables 7DT to follow up GW events quickly and discover EM counterparts. Among 20 planned telescopes, 12 units are deployed at the El Sauce Observatory located at Rio Hurtado Valley in Chile. Since we obtained the first light of 7DT in October 2023, we started its commissioning procedures including examination of bias levels, master flat production, and spectrophotometric standardization. In this talk, we present 7DT instruments and their set-up, commissioning procedures, and data characteristics of 7DT along with our three-layered surveys which are assumed to be initiated in early 2024.</description>

      <title>Project Management for Ground-based Telescope Array Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Center for the Gravitational-Wave Universe at Seoul National University has been operating its main observational facility, the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT) since October 2023. Located at El Sauce Observatory in Chilean Rio Hurtado Valley, 7DT consists of 20 50-cm telescopes equipped with 40 medium-band filters of 25 nm full width at half maximum along with a CMOS camera of 61 megapixels. 7DT produces about 1 TB per night of spectral mapping image data including calibration, and the byproduct of the data reduction pipeline once our planned three layered surveys (Reference Imaging Survey, Wide Field Survey, and Intensive Monitoring Survey) start in 2024. We are expecting to generate 1 PB per year by combining raw data, reduced data, and data products (e.g. calibrated stacked images, spectral cubes, and object catalogs). To incorporate this huge amount of data, we now have a data storage for 1 PB which we will increment by 1 PB per year. We also have a high-performance computation facility that is equipped with 2 NVIDIA A100 GPU cards since we plan to carry out real-time data reduction and analysis for follow-up observation data of gravitational wave events. To incorporate this, we established a 400 Mbps network connection between the facilities in Korea and Chile. Taking advantage of the high-performance network, we have been carrying out fully remote operations since October 2023. In this talk, we present details of designing, planning, and executing the ground-based telescope facility project, especially within low-budget academic environments. While we cover as much ground as possible, we will emphasize human resource management, project risk management, and financial contingency management.</description>

      <title>Predicted Brightness of Starlink Internet Satellites at 350 km</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SpaceX recently proposed to orbit 19,440 Starlink internet satellites at a low altitude of 350 km instead of the current 550 km. The distribution in the sky and the apparent magnitudes of these spacecraft are simulated in this paper. During astronomical twilight the impact of spacecraft at 350 km on astronomical observations would be more severe than those at 550 km. However, during the hours of darkness those at 350 km would have a less severe impact. The qualitative statement made by SpaceX to the US Federal Communications Commision is consistent with the quantitative results reported here.</description>

      <title>A physical optics characterization of the beam shape and sidelobe levels for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) is undergoing a design study for a large (50 meter) single-dish submm-wavelength Ritchey-Chr\'etien telescope to be located 5050 meters above sea level in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It will allow for observations covering 30 to 950 GHz. Observing at such high frequencies with a 50~m primary mirror will be challenging, and has never been attempted thus far. This observational capability demands exquisite control of systematics to ensure a reliable beam shape, and to mitigate the expected sidelobe levels. Among them, critical issues that large telescopes like AtLAST need to deal with are introduced by the panel gap pattern, the secondary mirror supporting struts, mirror deformations produced by thermal and gravitational effects, and Ruze scattering due to surface roughness. Proprietary software such as TICRA-Tools allows for full-wave, complex-field physical optics simulations taking into account these features. Such calculations can be computationally expensive since the mirror surfaces are gridded (meshed) into a fine array in which each element is treated as a current source. If the telescope size is large and the wavelengths are short this may lead to very long running times. Here we present a set of physical optics results that allow us to estimate the performance of the telescope in terms of beam shape, directivity, sidelobes level and stray light. We also discuss how we addressed the computational challenges, and provide caveats on how to shorten the run times. Above all, we conclude that the scattering effects from the gaps and tertiary support structure are minimal, and subdominant to the Ruze scattering.</description>

      <title>Performance Characterization of Heliotrope Solar Hot-Air Balloons during Multihour Stratospheric Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heliotropes are passive solar hot air balloons that are capable of achieving nearly level flight within the lower stratosphere for several hours. These inexpensive flight platforms enable stratospheric sensing with high-cadence enabled by the low cost to manufacture, but their performance has not yet been assessed systematically. During July to September of 2021, 29 heliotropes were successfully launched from Oklahoma and achieved float altitude as part of the Balloon-based Acoustic Seismology Study (BASS). All of the heliotrope envelopes were nearly identical with only minor variations to the flight line throughout the campaign. Flight data collected during this campaign comprise a large sample to characterize the typical heliotrope flight behavior during launch, ascent, float, and descent. Each flight stage is characterized, dependence on various parameters is quantified, and a discussion of nominal and anomalous flights is provided.</description>

      <title>Using conditional GANs for convergence map reconstruction with uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and unravelling the mysteries of dark matter are fundamental challenges in contemporary cosmology. Reconstruction of the cosmological matter distribution from lensing observables, referred to as 'mass-mapping' is an important aspect of this quest. Mass-mapping is an ill-posed problem, meaning there is inherent uncertainty in any convergence map reconstruction. The demand for fast and efficient reconstruction techniques is rising as we prepare for upcoming surveys. We present a novel approach which utilises deep learning, in particular a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), to approximate samples from a Bayesian posterior distribution, meaning they can be interpreted in a statistically robust manner. By combining data-driven priors with recent regularisation techniques, we introduce an approach that facilitates the swift generation of high-fidelity, mass maps. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our approach, we train the model on mock COSMOS-style data, generated using Colombia Lensing's kappaTNG mock weak lensing suite. These preliminary results showcase compelling convergence map reconstructions and ongoing refinement efforts are underway to enhance the robustness of our method further.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Classifying Flares in High-Resolution Solar Spectra with Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun's magnetic activity. Detecting and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine learning models, and found that the best performing algorithm is a C-Support Vector Machine (SVC) with non-linear kernels, specifically Radial Basis Functions (RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70 for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy, investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning models, and incorporating more datasets to extend the application of this framework to stars that host exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Pade: A code for protoplanetary disk turbulence based on Pade differencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pade code has been developed to treat hydrodynamic turbulence in protoplanetary disks. It solves the compressible equations of motion in cylindrical coordinates. Derivatives are computed using non-diffusive and conservative fourth-order Pade differencing, which has higher resolving power compared to both dissipative shock-capturing schemes used in most astrophysics codes, as well as non-diffusive central finite-difference schemes of the same order. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used for time stepping. A previously reported error-corrected Fargo approach is used to reduce the time step constraint imposed by rapid Keplerian advection. Artificial bulk viscosity is used when shock-capturing is required. Tests for correctness and scaling with respect to the number of processors are presented. Finally, efforts to improve efficiency and accuracy are suggested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an alternative to the Monte Carlo method for dust continuous radiative transfer simulations: the Quasi-Monte Carlo method. We briefly discuss what it is, its history, and possible implementations. We compare the Monte Carlo method with four pseudo-random number generators and five Quasi-Monte Carlo implementations using different low-discrepancy sequences and the Hammersley set. For the comparison, we study different test matter geometries and problems. We present comparison results for single scatterings of radiation from a point source, multiple scatterings of radiation from a point source, and single scatterings of radiation from a spherical star. In all cases, Quasi-Monte Carlo shows better convergence than Monte Carlo. In several test cases, the gain in computation time to achieve a fixed error value reached 40 times. We obtained ten times speed up in many of the considered tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Parity-Odd Power (POP) spectra, a novel set of observables for probing parity violation in cosmological $N$-point statistics. POP spectra are derived from composite fields obtained by applying nonlinear transformations, involving also gradients, curls, and filtering functions, to a scalar field. This compresses the parity-odd trispectrum into a power spectrum. These new statistics offer several advantages: they are computationally fast to construct, estimating their covariance is less demanding compared to estimating that of the full parity-odd trispectrum, and they are simple to model theoretically. We measure the POP spectra on simulations of a scalar field with a specific parity-odd trispectrum shape. We compare these measurements to semi-analytic theoretical calculations and find agreement. We also explore extensions and generalizations of these parity-odd observables.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Constrained velocity-free control of spacecraft attitude via explicit reference governor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an explicit reference governor-based control scheme tailored for addressing the velocity-free spacecraft attitude maneuver problem. This problem is subject to specific constraints, namely the pointing constraint, angular velocity constraint, and input saturation. The proposed control scheme operates in two layers, ensuring the asymptotic stability of the spacecraft's attitude while adhering to the aforementioned constraints. The inner layer employs output feedback control utilizing an angular velocity observer based on immersion and invariance technology. This observer facilitates attitude stabilization without the measurement of angular velocity. Through an analysis of the geometry associated with the pointing constraint, determination of the upper bound of angular velocity, and optimization of the control input solution, the reference layer establishes a safety boundary described by the invariant set. Additionally, we introduce the dynamic factor related to the angular velocity estimation error into the invariant set to prevent states from exceeding the constraint set due to unmeasurable angular velocity information. The shortest guidance path is then designed in the reference layer. Finally, we substantiate the efficacy of the proposed constrained attitude control algorithm through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for the polarized imprint of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as direct evidence of cosmic inflation requires exquisite sensitivity and control over systematics. The next-generation CMB-S4 project intends to improve upon current-generation experiments by deploying a significantly greater number of highly-sensitive detectors, combined with refined instrument components based on designs from field-proven instruments. The Precursor Small Aperture Telescope (PreSAT) is envisioned as an early step to this next generation, which will test prototype CMB-S4 components and technologies within an existing BICEP Array receiver, with the aim of enabling full-stack laboratory testing and early risk retirement, along with direct correlation of laboratory component-level performance measurements with deployed system performance. The instrument will utilize new 95/155GHz dichroic dual-linear-polarization prototype detectors developed for CMB-S4, cooled to 100mK via the installation of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator, along with a prototype readout chain and prototype optics manufactured with wide-band anti-reflection coatings. The experience gained by integrating, deploying, and calibrating PreSAT will also help inform planning for CMB-S4 small aperture telescope commissioning, calibration, and operations well in advance of the fabrication of CMB-S4 production hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03736v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement an eccentric search for compact binary mergers based on particle swarm optimization. Orbital eccentricity is an invaluable input for understanding the formation scenarios of the binary mergers and can play a pivotal role in finding their electromagnetic counterparts. Current modelled searches rely on pre-computed template banks that are computationally expensive and resistant towards expanding the search parameter space dimensionality. On the other hand, particle swarm optimization offers a straightforward algorithm that dynamically selects template points while exploring an arbitrary dimensional parameter space. Through extensive evaluation using simulated signals from spin-aligned eccentric binary mergers, we discovered that the search exhibits a remarkable autonomy in capturing the effects of both eccentricity and spin. We describe our search pipeline and revisit some of the merger candidates from the gravitational wave transient catalogs.</description>

Abstract: Proton auroras are widely observed on the dayside of Mars, identified as a significant intensity enhancement in the hydrogen Lyman alpha (121.6 nm) emission between 110 - 150 km altitudes. Solar wind protons penetrating as energetic neutral atoms into Mars thermosphere are thought to be primarily responsible for these auroras. Recent observations of spatially localized (patchy) proton auroras suggest a possible direct deposition of protons into Mars atmosphere during unstable solar wind conditions. Improving our understanding of proton auroras is therefore important for characterizing the solar wind interaction with Mars atmosphere. Here, we develop a first purely data-driven model of proton auroras using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) in-situ observations and limb scans of Ly-alpha emissions between 2014 - 2022. We train an artificial neural network (ANN) that reproduces individual Lyman alpha intensities and relative Lyman alpha peak intensity enhancements with a Pearson correlation of 0.94 and 0.60 respectively for the test data, along with a faithful reconstruction of the shape of the observed Lyman alpha emission altitude profiles. By performing a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, we find that solar zenith angle, solar longitude, CO2 atmosphere variability, solar wind speed and temperature are the most important features for the modeled Lyman alpha peak intensity enhancements. Additionally, we find that the modeled peak intensity enhancements are high for early local time hours, particularly near polar latitudes, as well as weaker induced magnetic fields. Through SHAP analysis, we also identify the influence of biases in the training data and interdependecies between the measurements used for the modeling, and an improvement on those aspects can significantly improve the performance and applicability of the ANN model.</description>

      <title>Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog (AKRA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00316v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is an invaluable tool for understanding fundamental cosmological physics. An unresolved issue in weak lensing cosmology is to accurately reconstruct the lensing convergence $\kappa$ maps from discrete shear catalog with survey masks, which the seminal Kaiser-Squire (KS) method is not designed to address. We present the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog (AKRA) to address the issue of mask. AKRA is built upon the prior-free maximum likelihood mapmaking method (or the unbiased minimum variance linear estimator). It is mathematically robust in dealing with mask, numerically stable to implement, and practically effective in improving the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulated maps with mask fractions ranging from 10\% to 50\% and various mask shapes, we demonstrate that AKRA outperforms KS at both the map level and summary statistics such as the auto power spectrum $C_\kappa$ of the reconstructed map, its cross-correlation coefficient $r_\ell$ with the true $\kappa $ map, the scatter plot and the localization measure. Unlike the Wiener filter method, it adopts no priors on the signal power spectrum, and therefore avoids the Wiener filter related biases at both the map level and cross-correlation statistics. If we only use the reconstructed map in the unmasked regions, the reconstructed $C_\kappa$ is accurate to $1\%$ or better and $1-r_\ell \lesssim 1\%$ (excluding $\ell$ at the smallest scales investigated), even for extreme cases of mask fraction and shape. As the first step, the current version of AKRA only addresses the mask issue and therefore ignores complexities such as curved sky and inhomogeneous shape measurement noise. AKRA is capable of dealing with these issues straightfowrardly, and will be addressed in the next version.</description>

      <title>Automated Evaluation of Environmental Coupling for Advanced LIGO Gravitational Wave Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extreme sensitivity required for direct observation of gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO detectors means that environmental noise is increasingly likely to contaminate Advanced LIGO gravitational wave signals if left unaddressed. Consequently, environmental monitoring efforts have been undertaken and novel noise mitigation techniques have been developed which have reduced environmental coupling and made it possible to analyze environmental artifacts with potential to affect the 90 gravitational wave events detected from 2015-2020 by the Advanced LIGO detectors. So far, there is no evidence for environmental contamination in gravitational wave detections. However, automated, rapid ways to monitor and assess the degree of environmental coupling between gravitational wave detectors and their surroundings are needed as the rate of detections continues to increase. We introduce a computational tool, PEMcheck, for quantifying the degree of environmental coupling present in gravitational wave signals using data from the extant collection of environmental monitoring sensors at each detector. We find that PEMcheck's automated analysis identifies only a small number of gravitational waves that merit further study by environmental noise experts due to possible contamination, a substantial improvement over the manual vetting that occurred for every gravitational wave candidate in the first two observing runs. With the validation provided herein; PEMcheck will play a critical role in event validation during LIGO's fourth observing run as an integral part of the data quality report produced for each gravitational wave candidate.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02398</link>

Abstract: Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, the Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 yr, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light-curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and they demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter.</description>

      <title>Combining Gaia and GRAVITY: Characterising five new Directly Detected Substellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high-angular-resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work to eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which were previously unknown and five are of a substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at an angular separation of (34.01 $\pm$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. This translates to a semi-major axis of (0.938 $\pm$ 0.023) AU. WT 766 B, detected at a greater angular separation, was confirmed to be on an orbit exhibiting an even smaller semi-major axis of (0.676 $\pm$ 0.008) AU. The GRAVITY data were then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enabled us to further characterise them in terms of their ages, effective temperatures, and radii via the application of evolutionary models. The inferred ages exhibit a distinct bias towards values younger than what is to be expected based on the literature. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular-resolution direct imaging holds great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as an Extrasolar Planet Discovery and Characterization: Interior Structure and Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of radio emission from Jupiter was identified quickly as being due to its planetary-scale magnetic field. Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets, and even some moons, either have or have had large-scale magnetic fields. In the case of the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the their magnetic fields are generated by dynamo processes within these planets, and an interaction between the solar wind and their magnetic fields generates intense radio emission via the electron cyclotron maser instability. In the case of Jupiter, its magnetic field interacts with the moon Io to result in radio emission as well.
  Extrasolar planets reasonably may be expected to generate large-scale magnetic fields and to sustain an electron cyclotron maser instability. Not only may these radio emissions be a means for discovering extrasolar planets, because magnetic fields are tied to the properties of planetary interiors, radio emissions may be a remote sensing means of constraining extrasolar planetary properties that will be otherwise difficult to access. In the case of terrestrial planets, the presence or absence of a magnetic field may be an indicator for habitability. Since the first edition of the Handbook, there have been a number of advances, albeit there remain no unambigous detection of radio emission from extrasolar planets. New ground-based telescopes and new possibilities for space-based telescopes provide promise for the future.</description>

      <title>Velocity Analysis of Moving Objects in Earth Observation Satellite Images Using Multi-Spectral Push Broom Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a method for detecting and analyzing the velocities of moving objects in Earth observation satellite images, specifically using data from Planet Labs' push broom scanning satellites. By exploiting the sequential acquisition of multi-spectral images, we estimate the relative differences in acquisition times between spectral bands. This allows us to determine the velocities of moving objects, such as aircraft, even without precise timestamp information from the image archive. We validate our method by comparing the velocities of aircraft observed in satellite images with those reported by onboard ADS-B transponders. The results demonstrate the potential, despite challenges posed by proprietary data limitations, of a new, useful application of commercial satellite data originally intended as an ongoing, once-daily survey of single images covering the entire land-area of the Earth. Our approach extends the applicability of satellite survey imagery for dynamic object tracking and contributes to the broader use of commercial satellite data in scientific research.</description>
