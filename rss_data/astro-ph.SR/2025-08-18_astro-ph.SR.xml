      <title>The BSN Application-I: Photometric Light Curve Solutions of Contact Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light curve analysis of W UMa-type contact binary systems using MCMC or MC methods can be time-consuming, primarily because the repeated generation of synthetic light curves tends to be relatively slow during the fitting process. Although various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, their implementation is often challenging due to complexity or uncertain performance. In this study, we introduce the BSN application, whose name is taken from the BSN project. The application is designed for analyzing contact binary system light curves, supporting photometric data, and employing an MCMC algorithm for efficient parameter estimation. The BSN application generates synthetic light curves more than 40 times faster than PHOEBE during the MCMC fitting process. The BSN application enhances light curve analysis with an expanded feature set and a more intuitive interface while maintaining compliance with established scientific standards. In addition, we present the first light curve analyses of four contact binary systems based on the TESS data, utilizing the BSN application version 1.0. We also conducted a light curve analysis using the PHOEBE Python code and compared the resulting outputs. Two of the target systems exhibited asymmetries in the maxima of their light curves, which were appropriately modeled by introducing a cold starspot on one of the components. The estimated mass ratios of these total-eclipse systems place them within the category of low mass ratio contact binary stars. The estimation of the absolute parameters for the selected systems was carried out using the $P-a$ empirical relationship. Based on the effective temperatures and masses of the components, three of the target systems were classified as A-subtype, while TIC 434222993 was identified as a W-subtype system.</description>

      <title>BSN-II: The First Light Curve Study of Eight Total Eclipsing Contact Binary Stars with Shallow Fillout Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of eight total-eclipse W Ursae Majoris-type contact binary systems. Ground-based photometric multiband observations were conducted at a Mexican observatory, and new times of minima were extracted. The O-C analysis reveals that four of our target binaries exhibit a long-term increase in their orbital periods, while the others show a long-term decrease in their orbital periods. We analyzed the light curves using the PHOEBE Python code and BSN application. Among the target systems, two required the inclusion of a cold starspot on one of the components to achieve an adequate fit. The light curve analysis revealed that the target systems exhibit a shallow fillout factor. Absolute parameters were estimated using the Gaia DR3 parallax and astrophysics equations. Considering the effective temperatures and component masses, each system was classified as either the A- or W-subtype. The stellar evolution of the systems was represented through the mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams. Additionally, we calculated the initial masses of the companion stars and the total mass lost for each target system.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based classification of variable stars using phase-folded light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying variable stars is crucial for advancing our understanding of stellar evolution and dynamics. As large-scale surveys generate increasing volumes of light curve data, the demand for automated and reliable classification techniques continues to grow. Traditional methods often rely on manual feature extraction and selection, which can be labor-intensive and less effective for managing extensive datasets. In this study, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for classifying variable stars using raw light curve data and their known periods. Our approach eliminates the need for manual feature extraction and preselected preprocessing steps. By applying phase-folding and interpolation to structure the light curves, the model learns variability patterns critical for accurate classification. Trained and evaluated on the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) dataset, our model achieves an average accuracy of 90% and an F1 score of 0.86 across six well-known classes of variable stars. The CNN effectively handles the diverse shapes and sampling cadences of light curves, offering a robust, automated, data-driven solution for classifying variable stars. This automated, data-driven method provides a robust solution for classifying variable stars, enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets from both current and future sky surveys.</description>

      <title>Detection of young massive white dwarfs in core-collapsed globular cluster NGC 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapsed globular clusters are ideal targets to explore the presence of stellar collision products. Here, we have studied seventeen FUV bright white dwarf members in the globular cluster NGC 362 using data obtained from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) mounted on AstroSat and from HST. Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV and optical data sets to characterize and determine the parameters of white dwarfs. Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K, 0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of the companions (low-mass main-sequence stars) are 3500 - 3750 K, 0.150 - 0.234 Rsun,0.003 - 0.01 Lsun, and 0.14 - 0.24 Msun, respectively. The three binary systems (WD-MS), along with the massive WDs may have formed through dynamical processes that occurred during the core collapse of the cluster. This is the first evidence of a massive WD formation in a core-collapsed cluster, which is the missing link in the formation of a fast radio burst (FRB) progenitor in a globular cluster. This study provides evidence that NGC 362 hosts stellar systems that may evolve into exotic stars such as Type Ia supernovae, and/or FRBs in the future. *This is paper VI of the Globular Cluster UVIT Legacy Survey.</description>

      <title>Activity-Cycle Variations of Convection Scales in Subsurface Layers of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use subsurface-flow velocity maps inferred by time--distance helioseismology from Doppler measurements with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to investigate variations of large-scale convection during Solar Cycles 24 and 25 in the 19-Mm-deep layer. The spatial power spectra of the horizontal-flow divergence reveal well-defined characteristic scales of solar supergranulation in the upper 4 Mm layer, while the giant-cell scale is prominent below levels of d ~ 8 Mm. We find that the characteristic scales of supergranulation remain stable while the giant scales increase during the periods of the 11-year activity cycle maxima. The power of the giant-cell scales increases with the enhancement of solar activity. This may be due to large-scale flows around active regions and, presumably, solar-cycle variations of the convection-zone stratification.</description>

      <title>Type IIb Supernova Progenitors in 3D: Variability and Episodic Mass Loss revealed by Radiation-Hydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first 3D Radiation-Hydrodynamics simulations of partially-stripped ($M_\mathrm{core}\sim10M_\odot$, $M_\mathrm{env}\sim0.1-1M_\odot$) Yellow Supergiant ($L\sim10^5$, $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx5000-8000$K) envelopes, constructed with Athena++. These envelope models represent the progenitors of Type IIb supernovae (SNe-IIb), which have lost a substantial fraction of their H-rich envelope before undergoing core-collapse. The luminosity-to-mass ratio is high in these extended envelopes, and convection is strongly driven by Hydrogen and Helium opacity peaks. This surface convection, coupled with changes in the opacity, sustains large-amplitude low-azimuthal-order radial pulsations, creating order-of-magnitude variability in the stellar luminosity on a timescale of tens of days. If persistent prior to a SN-IIb, these variations could herald the upcoming explosion. Supersonic fluid motions across the outer layers of the star lead to both successful and failed mass ejection events, which shape the circumstellar environment and drive episodic mass loss ($\sim10^{-6}-10^{-5}M_\odot/$yr, in outbursts). The resulting 3D gas distribution in the outer atmosphere, responsible for early-time supernova shock-breakout and shock-cooling emission, shows orders-of-magnitude fluctuations in both space and time at any given radial location. This intrinsically complex halo of bound and unbound material complicates predictions for early SN-IIb lightcurves relative to spherically-symmetric models. However, it does provide a natural, self-consistent explanation for the presence and diversity of dense circumstellar material observed or inferred around pulsating evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Mass Loss and Subsequent Thermal Evolution of Surviving Helium White Dwarfs Shocked by Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in a double white dwarf (WD) binary, a surviving WD companion leaves at its orbital velocity $\approx 1$,000 - 3,000 km/s. The Gaia mission has discovered seven such hypervelocity WDs with inflated radii indicative of shock heating by SN ejecta. We study the interaction between SN ejecta and Roche lobe-filling 0.08 - 0.45 $M_{\odot}$ helium WD companions using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++. Given the importance of the later thermal evolution, we include an accurate equation-of-state for the degenerate helium WD donor. We show that a lower-mass, larger-radius WD companion is more strongly impacted by SN ejecta and undergoes substantial mass loss. We find a tight relation between the fractional mass loss and the ratio between the ejecta ram pressure and donor volume-averaged pressure, which can be used for predicting mass loss in other systems. In the most extreme case, the companion becomes a very inflated $\approx0.02\,M_{\odot}$ object. We find helium mass loss $\approx 0.005 - 0.06\,M_{\odot}$ with velocities $\approx $ 1,000$-$4,000 km/s, which may lead to emission lines in the nebular phase. The surviving helium WD receives a kick velocity, but its final velocity is essentially determined by its orbital velocity $\lesssim$ 1,600 km/s. We model the post-explosion evolution of the shock-heated companions using MESA, and find reasonable agreement with the hypervelocity stars D6-2, J0546+0836, J1332-3541 &amp; SDSS J1637+3631. A surviving $\gtrsim 0.3\,M_{\odot}$ helium WD can be ruled out in SN1972E &amp; SN2011fe, and any surviving helium WD is likely ruled out in SN remnants 0509-67.5 &amp; SN1006.</description>

      <title>The highest mass Kepler red giants -- II. Spectroscopic parameters, the amplitude-activity relation, and unexpected halo orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-mass (M$&gt;$2 \Msolar{}) Kepler red giant stars are less well-studied than their lower-mass counterparts. In the previous article, we presented a sample of 48 high-mass Kepler red giants and measured their asteroseismic parameters. This article presents spectroscopic measurements from the same sample, using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra to determine \Teff{}, [Fe/H], \logg{}, and $v \sin i$. We refined our previous estimates of the stellar masses and radii based on the new \Teff{}. We also examined spectral features that could indicate binary activity, such as the Li line and [C/N] ratios. We found no Li-rich stars or clear [C/N] anomalies, but we observed a correlation between [C/N] and [Fe/H]. We measured chromospheric activity using the $S$-index of the Ca II H \&amp; K lines and found no correlation with internal magnetic fields. However, we confirmed an anti-correlation between surface chromospheric activity and radial mode oscillation amplitudes, which indicates that strong surface magnetic fields weaken stellar oscillations. Finally, we used the Gaia DR3 astrometric data to show that our sample of stars have orbits consistent with all three Galactic kinematic regions. Although these stars are quite young, their orbits carry them into the thick disk and even the halo, raising questions about the accuracy and viability of kinematics in unravelling Galactic history. In future work, we plan to use the spectroscopic parameters measured here to provide better constraints for boutique frequency modelling, which will allow us to test the asteroseismic scaling relations at the high-mass regime.</description>

      <title>The Fraction of Distilled White Dwarfs with Long-Lived Habitable Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After carbon and oxygen, $^{22}$Ne is the most abundant element in white dwarf interiors. As C/O white dwarfs (WDs) crystallize, they are predicted to go through a distillation process in the central layers if they have a sufficiently high $^{22}$Ne mass fraction of $\gtrsim2.5$\%. Observational evidence for distillation comes from an over-density of WDs on the Q-branch in Gaia color-magnitude diagrams, which indicates that $\sim6$\% of massive WDs are delayed in their cooling by as much as $\sim10$ Gyr. However, it is unclear how these stars end up with such a high concentration of $^{22}$Ne and if a significant fraction of the more common average-mass WDs go through distillation. We argue that a significant metal-rich stellar population in the solar neighborhood should lead to distilled WDs, without requiring a binary merger. We use MESA along with the CNO abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of stars included in the Hypatia catalog to predict the $^{22}$Ne mass fraction in their descendant WDs. We find that 0.6-2.5\% of the WDs in the solar neighborhood have sufficient $^{22}$Ne in their interiors to go through multi-Gyr cooling delays, which could significantly inflate their numbers in the observed samples. Hence, $^{22}$Ne distillation and long-lived habitable zones around WDs should be relatively common in the solar neighborhood. We also use a Galactic model to predict the fraction of WDs that go through distillation as a function of Galactocentric distance. The fraction of distilled WDs is $\sim2$-8\% near the Galactic center, and declines steadily toward the outer disk.</description>

      <title>Image Profile (IMPRO) Fitting of Massive Protostars. I. Method Development and Test Cases of Cepheus A and G35.20-0.74N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass, envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties. We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A, finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Demographics of Binary Companions to Stripped-Envelope Supernovae: Confronting Observations with Population Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) mark the deaths of massive stars without hydrogen-rich envelopes. Most SESNe likely originate from binary systems where a companion stripped the progenitor of its envelope. Years of HST imaging of nearby SESNe sites have produced a statistically meaningful sample of constraints on surviving binary companions. We assemble the current sample of six companion detections and six non-detections from the literature, re-analyzing whenever needed. We then conduct the first statistical comparison with binary population-synthesis predictions, primarily based on new calculations performed with the POSYDON framework. Across a metallicity range, our models predict that 80-90% of Type Ib/c and 60-85% of IIb SNe explode with a rapidly rotating, main-sequence companion. The observed luminosity distribution favors fairly inefficient mass accretion and failed explosions of the most massive stripped stars. The companion detection fraction broadly matches predictions, given the imaging depth, but appears elevated for Type IIb SNe. In all but one non-detection, a faint, undetected companion is the most likely scenario. The red, apparently evolved companions in a few Type Ib/c SNe may result from strong interaction with the ejecta, expected in $\sim$12% of them. Companion demographics offer a powerful, independent probe of SESN progenitor systems, with the current sample disfavoring efficient accretion and supporting Wolf-Rayet non-explodability. Larger companion samples and follow-up studies will further clarify binary pathways to SESNe, serving as benchmarks for transient surveys.</description>

      <title>Observational Analysis of Multi-thermal Counter-streaming Flows in a Forming Filament and Their Relationship with Local Heating at Filament Footpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we investigated the nature and origin of counter-streaming flows within a forming active region filament. The ever-present counter-streaming flows observed within the filament are identified as interleaved unidirectional mass flows in opposing directions occurring in neighboring threads. Multi-wavelength observations corroborate the multi-thermal nature of these counter-streaming flows: the cool H$\alpha$ component flows at about 10--20 km s$^{-1}$, while the warm ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet components reach 40--70 km s$^{-1}$. The Si~{\sc iv} 1400~{\AA} line reveals significant micro-turbulence in the filament's counter-streaming flows, with a nonthermal velocity width of 40 km s$^{-1}$. These multi-thermal flows emanate from compact brightenings at the filament's ends, manifesting as small-scale, collimated upflows at their nascent phase. They continuously inject both chromospheric and transition region plasma into the filament channel, thereby feeding the counter-streaming flows. At their base, the Si~{\sc iv} and C~{\sc ii} spectral lines show pronounced line broadening and intensity enhancements, indicating significant localized chromospheric heating. Additionally, numerous small-scale photospheric flux emergence and cancellation events, with magnitude of $10^{17}$~Mx, are detected near their base. We suggest such weak magnetic-field activities, possibly associated with unresolved magnetic reconnection events, drive these persistent upflows and localized footpoint heating. This work elucidates the multi-thermal origin of counter-streaming flows within a forming filament and provides evidence of localized chromospheric heating at the filament footpoints.</description>

      <title>A bird's eye view of stellar evolution through populations of variable stars in Galactic open clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both star clusters and variable stars are sensitive laboratories of stellar astrophysics and evolution: cluster member stars provide context for interpreting cluster populations, whereas variability reveals the nature of individual stellar systems. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has revolutionized the census of star clusters in the Milky Way, while simultaneously providing an unprecedented homogeneous all-sky catalog of variable stars. Here, we leverage the third Gaia data release to obtain an empirical bird's eye view of stellar evolution based on 34760 variable stars residing in 1192 Galactic open clusters (OCs) containing 173294 members (variable member fraction 20.0%). Using precise OC distances, dereddened magnitudes, and consistently determined ages, we a) pinpointed regions of pulsational instability across the color-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD); b) traced the occurrence rate of variables as a function of age, and c) considered the evolution of rotation periods and photometric activity (gyrochronology). The occurrence of pulsating stars can serve as a model- and reddening-independent age estimator. Our results underline that jointly considering stellar variability and OC membership enables a plethora of further applications, such as age dating or dereddening OCs based on expected CaMD locations of variable stars. Upcoming Gaia data releases and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will vastly increase the extent to which the details of variable stars in OCs can empirically unravel the astrophysics and evolution of stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Stochasticity in Stellar Yields Reflected in Theoretical Dust Masses Estimates Across all Type II Supernova Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the primary sources of dust in galaxies. In this study, we derive theoretical upper limits on dust masses as a function of supernova (SN) progenitors with initial masses between 9 and 120 Msun, based on previously established models of dust formation chemistry in CCSNe. We find that O-rich dust, particularly silicates, dominates the dust budget, with masses ranging from 0.02 to 0.9 Msun, and that the total mass of O-rich dust increases with progenitor mass. C-rich amorphous carbon dust is significant for lower-mass progenitors (up to 15 Msun), but its mass never exceeds 0.05 Msun. For progenitors up to 30 Msun, we provide best-fit functions describing the masses of O-rich dust, C-rich dust, and CO molecules. A large stochastic variation is found in the predicted masses of silicate dust, which correlates with the randomness of shell-merger events in the pre-explosion phases of massive stars. Furthermore, we show that the dust mass for a given progenitor can vary by a factor of 2-5, reflecting differences in pre-explosion abundance profiles predicted by the stellar evolution codes KEPLER and MESA. We emphasize that the final dust yield in CCSNe is primarily determined by stochastic stellar yields and uncertainties in pre-explosion nucleosynthesis, while explosion properties mainly influence the timescales of dust formation.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Heating of the Magnetically Closed Solar Corona: Generation of Nanoflares, Thermodynamic Response of the Plasma and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy that heats the magnetically closed solar corona originates in the complex motions of the massive photosphere. Turbulent photospheric convection slowly displaces the footpoints of coronal field lines, causing them to become twisted and tangled. Magnetic stresses gradually build until reaching a breaking point when the field reconnects and releases a sudden burst of energy. We simulate this basic picture of nanoflares using a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, multi-stranded magnetohydrodynamic simulation that starts with a fully stratified atmosphere. This simulation includes the effects of field-aligned thermal conduction and optically thin radiation and uses the state-of-the-art Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to capture the response of the plasma to the nanoflare heating. We find that our physical model supports a unified explanation for both the diffuse emission observed in active regions and the bright coronal loops. Specifically, our results suggest that the diffuse emission originates from spatially and temporally uncorrelated nanoflares, whereas coherent clusters of nanoflares - nanoflare storms - are responsible for the formation of bright coronal loops. Quantitative comparisons between the simulated emission and observed characteristics of coronal loops show that key observed properties - such as loop widths, lifetimes and cross sections - are reasonably well reproduced by the model. The idea that avalanche spread naturally leads to circular cross sections in coronal loops is strongly supported. Our results also suggest that phase differences in heating and cooling events across neighboring magnetic flux strands are a plausible explanation for the anomalous cross-field motions of coronal loops that were recently reported in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Energy Conversion and Electron Acceleration and Transport in 3D Simulations of Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations and simulations indicate that solar flares undergo extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) evolution, making 3D particle transport models essential for understanding electron acceleration and interpreting flare emissions. In this study, we investigate this problem by solving Parker's transport equation with 3D MHD simulations of solar flares. By examining energy conversion in the 3D system, we evaluate the roles of different acceleration mechanisms, including reconnection current sheet (CS), termination shock (TS), and supra-arcade downflows (SADs). We find that large-amplitude turbulent fluctuations are generated and sustained in the 3D system. The model results demonstrate that a significant number of electrons are accelerated to hundreds of keV and even a few MeV, forming power-law energy spectra. These energetic particles are widely distributed, with concentrations at the TS and in the flare looptop region, consistent with results derived from recent hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave (MW) observations. By selectively turning particle acceleration on or off in specific regions, we find that the CS and SADs effectively accelerate electrons to several hundred keV, while the TS enables further acceleration to MeV. However, no single mechanism can independently account for the significant number of energetic electrons observed. Instead, the mechanisms work synergistically to produce a large population of accelerated electrons. Our model provides spatially and temporally resolved electron distributions in the whole flare region and at the flare footpoints, enabling synthetic HXR and MW emission modeling for comparison with observations. These results offer important insights into electron acceleration and transport in 3D solar flare regions.</description>

      <title>Size Distributions of Arcsecond-Scale Properties of Solar Flare Ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flare ribbons are believed to map the footpoints of newly reconnected magnetic flux tubes, therefore shedding light on the reconnecting current sheet, which is rarely observed by direct imaging or spectroscopy. Here we study the detailed evolution of flare ribbons down to the arcsecond scale for 10 flares characterized by the classic double ribbons. Identifying the flaring pixels by combining the intensity variances of the UV filter ratio and intensity threshold, we found that the waiting time distributions of the flaring pixels are well described by power laws, distinct from those in the preflare or quiet-Sun regions, and that the power-law slopes are generally consistent with those predicted by nonstationary Poisson processes in the nonlinear regime or by the 2D/3D self-organized criticality (SOC) model. The size distributions for flaring duration also follow power laws but the slopes are more scattered. In contrast, the size distributions for other parameters, including peak intensity, energy, and radial magnetic field strength of the flaring pixels, deviate from power laws, and the estimated slopes significantly differ from the SOC predictions. These results suggest that a nonstationary Poisson process or an avalanche-like process might be ongoing in the temporal dimension in the reconnecting current sheet, but in other aspects, e.g., space- and energy-wise, the avalanche is likely modulated by other physical processes or the fine structures of the reconnecting current sheet.</description>

      <title>A Panchromatic View of Late-time Shock Power in the Type II Supernova 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength observations of the type II supernova (SN II) 2023ixf during its first two years of evolution. We combine ground-based optical/NIR spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far- and near-ultraviolet spectroscopy and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy to create spectral energy distributions of SN 2023ixf at +374 and +620 days post-explosion, covering a wavelength range of ~0.1-30 $\mu$m. The multi-band light curve of SN 2023ixf follows a standard radioactive decay decline rate after the plateau until ~500 days, at which point shock powered emission from ongoing interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) begins to dominate. This evolution is temporally consistent with 0.3-10 keV X-ray detections of SN 2023ixf and broad ''boxy'' spectral line emission from reprocessing of shock luminosity in a cold dense shell located between forward and reverse shocks. Using the expected absorbed radioactive decay power and the detected X-ray luminosity, we quantify the total shock powered emission at the +374 and +620 day epochs and find that it can be explained by nearly complete thermalization of the reverse shock luminosity as SN 2023ixf interacts with a continuous, ''wind-like'' CSM with a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot M \approx 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w = 20 \pm 5$ km/s). Additionally, we construct multi-epoch spectral models from the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, which contain radioactive decay and shock powers, as well as dust absorption, scattering, and emission. We find that models with shock powers of $L_{sh} = (0.5-1) \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $(0.5 - 1) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of silicate dust in the cold dense shell and/or inner SN ejecta can effectively reproduce the global properties of the late-time (&gt;300 days) UV-to-IR spectra of SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Late-time Hubble Space Telescope Ultraviolet Spectra of SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi Show Ongoing Interaction with Circumstellar Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present far- and near-ultraviolet (UV) spectra of the Type II supernovae (SNe) SN~2023ixf from days 199 to 722 and SN~2024ggi at days 41 and 232. Both supernovae show broad, blueshifted, and asymmetric UV emission lines with an initial maximum velocity of $\sim9000\,km\,s^{-1}$ and narrow unresolved emission in CIV. We compare the optical and UV emission-line profiles, showing that they evolve from two distinct velocity profiles to a single profile tracing the UV emission. We interpret this as shock power from interaction with circumstellar material coming to dominate over the radioactive-decay power from the inner ejecta. Comparing our observations to radiative transfer models with injected shock power, we find SN~2024ggi is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock, abs}}=1\times10^{41}\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at day 40, SN~2023ixf at day 300 and SN~2024ggi at day 200 are best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=1\times10^{40}\,erg\,s^{-1}$, and SN~2023ixf at day 600 is best matched by $P_{\mathrm{shock,abs}}=5\times10^{39}\,erg\,s^{-1}$. From these models, we find the mass-loss rate of both supernovae increased just before explosion. For SN~2023ixf our mass-loss rates go from $4\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 600 yr before explosion to $2\times10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 15 yr prior to explosion. For SN~2024ggi, we find a mass-loss rate of $9\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 150 yr before explosion and $1\times10^{-3}\,M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ at 30 yr before explosion.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Strong oxygen depletion in the inner regions of a very low-mass star disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of $10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred column densities of \ce{C2H2} in the inner regions of the disk and produce a pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative thermo-chemical disk model P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O} to identify a disk structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature $\langle T \rangle$, column density $\langle$ log$_{\rm {10}} N\rangle$ and the emitting area $\langle r_{\rm{1}} - r_{\rm{2}} \rangle$ for these molecules from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion and C enhancement. We find that a disk structure characterised by the presence of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted in dust, especially small grains ($&lt;5\,\mu$m), and ..</description>

Abstract: Data on five Washington Double Star catalog binaries were collected from the Dimension Point Observatory (Mayhill, New Mexico) and Las Cumbres Observatory (Cerro Tololo, Chile) on February 19, 2025, and March 5, 2025, respectively. Student researchers participating in the Four Corners Research Seminar measured the position angle (theta/deg) and separation (rho/arcsec) of each target using AstroImageJ and an author-created script utilizing the Astropy module in Python3. Each target was imaged using a variety of instruments, filters, and exposure times. Compared to the extrapolated 6th Orbit Catalog estimates, measurements using AstroImageJ were within 1.52% of theta and 14.87% of rho, while the author's automated code method provided measurements within 4.09% of theta and 16.59% of rho.</description>

      <title>Magnetars in Binaries as the Engine of Actively Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Kinematics of Molecular Gas in Cometary Globule L1616</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.</description>

      <title>How many stars form in compact clusters in the local Milky Way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$ 50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.</description>

      <title>Morphological classification of eclipsing binary stars using computer vision methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers ($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high accuracy ($&gt;96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$, and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($&gt;94\%$, up to $100\%$ for $TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly, revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae in the eROSITA eRASS1 catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.</description>

      <title>Using Doppler Imaging to model stellar activity and search for planets around Sun-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doppler Imaging (DI) is a well-established technique to map a physical field at a stellar surface from a time series of high-resolution spectra. In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to show that traditional DI algorithms, originally designed for rapidly-rotating stars, have also the ability to model the activity of Sun-like stars, when observed with new-generation highly-stable spectrographs, and search for low-mass planets around them. We used DI to retrieve the relative brightness distribution at the surface of the Sun from radial velocity (RV) observations collected by HARPS-N between 2022 and 2024. The brightness maps obtained with DI have a typical angular resolution of about 36 degrees and are a good match to low-resolution disc-resolved Dopplergrams of the Sun at epochs when the absolute, disc-integrated RV exceeds ~2 m/s. The RV residuals after DI correction exhibit a dispersion of about 0.6 m/s, comparable with existing state-of-the-art activity correction techniques. Using planet injection-recovery tests, we also show that DI can be a powerful tool for blind planet searches, so long as the orbital period is larger than ~100days (i.e. 3 to 4 stellar rotation periods), and that it yields planetary mass estimates with an accuracy comparable to, for example, multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression. Finally, we highlight some limitations of traditional DI algorithms, which should be addressed to make DI a reliable alternative to state-of-the-art RV-based planet search techniques.</description>

      <title>Activity in White Dwarf Debris Disks I: Spitzer Legacy Reveals Variability Incompatible with the Canonical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents all available, multi-epoch 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m photometry from Spitzer Space Telescope observations of white dwarf debris disks, including weekly cadence observations of 16 relatively bright systems, and 5 h staring-mode observations for five of these. Significant variability is detected in 85 per cent of disks and across all timescales probed, from minutes to weeks to years, where the largest flux changes correlate with the longest time baselines, and the infrared excesses persist utterly. While each source is idiosyncratic, the overall results indicate the most variable disks correlate with those that are the brightest (dustiest), and also among those with detected gas, demonstrating both dust and gas are produced via ongoing collisions. There is a correlation between flux and colour changes, where disks tend to appear redder when dimmer and bluer when brighter, consistent with an excess of small dust grains produced in collisions, followed by a gradual return to equilibrium. The overall results are a drastic departure from the predictions of the canonical - geometrically thin, optically thick - disk in both flux and colour, but are broadly consistent with collisional evolution based on a simple model. The data presented herein constitute a legacy resource that can inform time-series studies of polluted and dusty white dwarfs, and importantly serve as a basis for future disk modelling, beyond the pioneering canonical framework.</description>

      <title>NutMaat: A Python package for stellar spectral classification on the MK system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, an open-source Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. It also includes modules for detecting classical chemically peculiar stars, such as Am, Ap, and $\lambda$ Boo types, using internal consistency checks between different line diagnostics. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\le$ 10. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library -- which lacks native MK classifications -- to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage beyond the 3800--5600 $\r{A}$ range, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. Beyond its technical design, NutMaat can provide consistent, MK-standard classification across large-scale spectroscopic surveys, facilitating reliable stellar population analyses, identification of rare objects, and the construction of high-quality spectral catalogs essential for galactic archaeology and stellar evolution studies. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Mass-feeding of jet-launching white dwarfs in grazing and common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a scenario that allows white dwarfs (WDs) to launch relatively powerful jets when they enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) or experience a grazing envelope evolution (GEE) with a red giant branch star (RGB) or an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. In this, still a speculative scenario, the accretion for a time is mainly onto an accretion disk with a radius of ~1Ro that increases in mass. The accretion disk launches the powerful two opposite jets by releasing gravitational energy, up to several times super-Eddington, as its mass increases. The jets launched by the disk remove high-entropy gas from its outskirts and the envelope that the WD inflates due to nuclear burning on its surface. The motivations to allow WDs to launch powerful jets are recent findings, from the morphologies of post-CEE planetary nebulae, that jets play a major role in the CEE and the accumulating evidence that jets power luminous red novae by jets, as their morphologies indicate. I strengthen my call to include jets in the simulation and modeling of the CEE, consider the GEE as a phase preceding the CEE in many (but not all) cases, and include jets as a major ingredient in modeling and simulating all energetic luminous red novae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meridional circulation in stratified stellar/planetary interiors in the presence of stable molecular weight gradients remains poorly understood, thereby affecting angular momentum transport in evolutionary models. We extend the downward control principle of atmospheric sciences to include compositional stratification. Using a linearized analysis we show that stable compositional gradients slow down the penetration of circulation into the depths, emphasizing the importance of time-dependent solutions. However, additional effects such as horizontal turbulence or magnetic fields are needed to halt it completely. We also find limits demarcating linear and nonlinear regimes in terms of Schmidt and Rossby numbers. Nonlinear simulations exhibit compositional mixing due to meridional currents, enabling deeper penetration than otherwise. We propose slowly evolving and steady-state scenarios for the solar tachocline, and helioseismically observed heavy element abundances, while acknowledging the absence of constraints on the radial variation of the Schmidt number. In the context of stellar evolution, differential rotation profiles of solar-type main-sequence stars may follow analytical solutions extending from Banik &amp; Menou (2024), thereby aiding further probes into magneto/hydrodynamic instabilities and outward angular momentum transport.</description>

      <title>Stellar metallicity is a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent microscopic calculations for electron captures on nuclei in core-collapse supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculations for electron capture rates on nuclei with atomic numbers between $Z=20$ and $Z=52$ are performed in a self-consistent finite-temperature covariant energy density functional theory within the relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Electron captures on these nuclei contribute most to reducing the electron fraction during the collapse phase of core-collapse supernovae. The rates include contributions from allowed (Gamow-Teller) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions, and it is shown that the latter become dominant at high stellar densities and temperatures. Temperature-dependent effects such as Pauli unblocking and transitions from thermally excited states are also included. The new rates are implemented in a spherically symmetric 1D simulation of the core-collapse phase. The results indicate that the increase in electron capture rates, due to inclusion of FF transitions, leads to reductions of the electron fraction at nuclear saturation density, the peak neutrino luminosity, and enclosed mass at core bounce. The new rates reaffirm that the most relevant nuclei for the deleptonization situate around the $N = 50$ and $82$ shell closures, but compared to previous simulations, nuclei are less proton rich. The new rates developed in this work are available, and will be of benefit to improve the accuracy of multi-dimensional supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>The impact of natal kicks on black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.</description>
