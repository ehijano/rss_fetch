      <title>Exploring End-to-end Differentiable Neural Charged Particle Tracking -- A Loss Landscape Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement and analysis of high energetic particles for scientific, medical or industrial applications is a complex procedure, requiring the design of sophisticated detector and data processing systems. The development of adaptive and differentiable software pipelines using a combination of conventional and machine learning algorithms is therefore getting ever more important to optimize and operate the system efficiently while maintaining end-to-end (E2E) differentiability. We propose for the application of charged particle tracking an E2E differentiable decision-focused learning scheme using graph neural networks with combinatorial components solving a linear assignment problem for each detector layer. We demonstrate empirically that including differentiable variations of discrete assignment operations allows for efficient network optimization, working better or on par with approaches that lack E2E differentiability. In additional studies, we dive deeper into the optimization process and provide further insights from a loss landscape perspective. We demonstrate that while both methods converge into similar performing, globally well-connected regions, they suffer under substantial predictive instability across initialization and optimization methods, which can have unpredictable consequences on the performance of downstream tasks such as image reconstruction. We also point out a dependency between the interpolation factor of the gradient estimator and the prediction stability of the model, suggesting the choice of sufficiently small values. Given the strong global connectivity of learned solutions and the excellent training performance, we argue that E2E differentiability provides, besides the general availability of gradient information, an important tool for robust particle tracking to mitigate prediction instabilities by favoring solutions that perform well on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Investigation of triangularity effects on tokamak edge turbulence through multi-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper uses the gyro-moment (GM) approach as a multi-fidelity tool to explore the effect of triangularity on tokamak edge turbulence. Considering experimental data from an L-mode DIII-D discharge, we conduct gyrokinetic (GK) simulations with realistic plasma edge geometry parameters at $\rho=0.95$. We find that employing ten GMs effectively captures essential features of both trapped electron mode (TEM) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence. By comparing electromagnetic GK simulations with adiabatic electron GK and reduced fluid simulations, we identify the range of validity of the reduced models. We observe that TEMs drive turbulent heat transport under nominal discharge conditions, hindering accurate transport level estimates by both simplified models. However, when TEMs are absent, and turbulence is ITG-driven, an agreement across the different models is observed. Finally, a parameter scan shows that the positive triangularity scenario destabilizes the TEM, therefore, the adiabatic electron model tends to show agreement with the electromagnetic simulations in zero and negative triangularity scenarios. On the other hand, the reduced fluid simulations exhibit limited sensitivity to triangularity changes, shedding light on the importance of retaining kinetic effects to accurately model the impact of triangularity turbulence in the tokamak edge. In conclusion, our multi-fidelity study suggests that a GM hierarchy with a limited number of moments is an ideal candidate for efficiently exploring triangularity effects on micro-scale turbulence.</description>

      <title>A Resolution Independent Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce a Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from the input data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as our trainable INR basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-Induced Boron Nitride Monolayers as Multifunctional Materials for Metal Ion Batteries and Hydrogen Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study comprehensively examined the structural, electronic, electrochemical, and energy storage properties of boron-vacancy induced porous boron nitride monolayers (BN:VB) as multifunctional materials, anodes for MIBs and H2 storage applications. Our computational approaches, density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and thermodynamic analysis, revealed exceptionally high energy and gravimetric densities for MIBs and H2 storage, respectively. We investigated the interactions of Li, Na, and K atoms on BN:VB, which strongly bonded with binding energies stronger than their bulk cohesive energies, which ensured structural stability and the absence of metal clustering. Electronic properties, analyzed through spin-polarized partial density of states (PDOS), band structure, and Bader charge analysis, revealed significant charge transfers from the metal atoms to BN:VB, enhancing the electronic conductivity of the latter. Theoretical specific capacities were calculated as 1821.53, 786.11, and 490.51 mA h/g for Li, Na, and K, respectively, which comfortably exceeded the conventional anodes, such as graphite. Average open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were found as 0.15, 0.25, and 0.32 V, for Li, Na, and K, respectively, indicating strong electrochemical stability. Diffusion studies showed lower barriers of 0.47, 0.08, and 0.60 eV for Li, Na, and K, respectively, with increased metal loadings, suggesting enhanced mobilities and charge/discharge rates. On the other side, the metal-functionalized BN:VB monolayers exhibited remarkably high H2 gravimetric capacities, supported by Langmuir adsorption model-based statistical thermodynamic analysis. Average adsorption energies of H2 on 4Li-, 4Na-, and 4K@BN:VB, were found in perfect range for practical storage applications.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Circuit Simulation with Memristors: Design and Evaluation Using MemTorch for MNIST and CIFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristors offer significant advantages as in-memory computing devices due to their non-volatility, low power consumption, and history-dependent conductivity. These attributes are particularly valuable in the realm of neuromorphic circuits for neural networks, which currently face limitations imposed by the Von Neumann architecture and high energy demands. This study evaluates the feasibility of using memristors for in-memory processing by constructing and training three digital convolutional neural networks with the datasets MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Subsequent conversion of these networks into memristive systems was performed using Memtorch. The simulations, conducted under ideal conditions, revealed minimal precision losses of nearly 1% during inference. Additionally, the study analyzed the impact of tile size and memristor-specific non-idealities on performance, highlighting the practical implications of integrating memristors in neuromorphic computing systems. This exploration into memristive neural network applications underscores the potential of Memtorch in advancing neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Surface roughening in nanoparticle catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supported metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts are vital for the sustainable production of chemicals, but their design and implementation are limited by the ability to identify and characterize their structures and atomic sites that are correlated with high catalytic activity. Identification of these ''active sites'' has relied heavily on extrapolation to supported NP systems from investigation of idealized surfaces, experimentally using single crystals or supported NPs which are always modelled computationally using slab or regular polyhedra models. However, the ability of these methods to predict catalytic activity remains qualitative at best, as the structure of metal NPs in reactive environments has only been speculated from indirect experimental observations, or otherwise remains wholly unknown. Here, by circumventing these limitations for highly accurate simulation methods, we provide direct atomistic insight into the dynamic restructuring of metal NPs by combining in situ spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations powered by a machine learned force field. We find that in reactive environments, NP surfaces evolve to a state with poorly defined atomic order, while the core of the NP may remain bulk-like. These insights prove that long-standing conceptual models based on idealized faceting for small metal NP systems are not representative of real systems under exposure to reactive environments. We show that the resultant structure can be elucidated by combining advanced spectroscopy and computational tools. This discovery exemplifies that to enable faithful quantitative predictions of catalyst function and stability, we must move beyond idealized-facet experimental and theoretical models and instead employ systems which include realistic surface structures that respond to relevant physical and chemical conditions.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid and antiferromagnetic correlations with hole doping in the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC) was recently found in the bilayer material La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under high pressures. We study the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model derived from the band structure of the La327. The model is solved by cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) with natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) as impurity solver at zero temperature, considering only normal states. With hole doping, we have observed sequentially the Mott insulator (Mott), pseudogap (PG), non-Fermi liquid (NFL), and Fermi liquid (FL) phases, with quantum correlations decreasing. The ground state of the La327 is in the NFL phase with Hund spin correlation, which transmits the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ ($z$) orbital inter-layer AFM correlation to the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. When the $\sigma$-bonding state of the $z$ orbitals ($z+$) is no longer fully filled, the inter-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations weaken rapidly. At low pressures, the fully filled $z+$ band supports a strong inter-layer AFM correlations, potentially favoring short-range spin density wave (SDW) and suppressing SC. Hole doping at low pressures may achieve a similar effect to high pressures, under which the $z+$ band intersects with the Fermi level, and consequently the spin correlations weaken remarkably, potentially suppressing the possible short-range SDW and favoring SC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-throughput $ab$ $initio$ calculations are the indispensable parts of data-driven discovery of new materials with desirable properties, as reflected in the establishment of several online material databases. The accumulation of extensive theoretical data through computations enables data-driven discovery by constructing machine learning and artificial intelligence models to predict novel compounds and forecast their properties. Efficient usage and extraction of data from these existing online material databases can accelerate the next stage materials discovery that targets different and more advanced properties, such as electron-phonon coupling for phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, extracting data from these databases, generating tailored input files for different $ab$ $initio$ calculations, performing such calculations, and analyzing new results can be demanding tasks. Here, we introduce a software package named "HTESP" (High-Throughput Electronic Structure Package) written in Python and Bash languages, which automates the entire workflow including data extraction, input file generation, calculation submission, result collection and plotting. Our HTESP will help speed up future computational materials discovery processes.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus and scaling of gradients in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab-initio simulations of multiple heavy quarks propagating in a Quark-Gluon Plasma are computationally difficult to perform due to the large dimension of the space of density matrices. This work develops machine learning algorithms to overcome this difficulty by approximating exact quantum states with neural network parametrisations, specifically Neural Density Operators. As a proof of principle demonstration in a QCD-like theory, the approach is applied to solve the Lindblad master equation in the 1+1d lattice Schwinger Model as an open quantum system. Neural Density Operators enable the study of in-medium dynamics on large lattice volumes, where multiple-string interactions and their effects on string-breaking and recombination phenomena can be studied. Thermal properties of the system at equilibrium can also be probed with these methods by variationally constructing the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. Scaling of this approach with system size is studied, and numerical demonstrations on up to 32 spatial lattice sites and with up to 3 interacting strings are performed.</description>
