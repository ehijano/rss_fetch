      <title>Verified Program Extraction in Number Theory: The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and Relatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article revisits standard theorems from elementary number theory through a constructive, algorithmic, and proof-theoretic lens, within the theory of computable functionals. Key examples include B\`ezout's identity, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and Fermat's factorization method. All definitions and theorems are fully formalized in the proof assistant Minlog, thereby laying the foundation for a comprehensive formal framework for number theory within Minlog.
  While formalization ensures correctness, our primary emphasis is on the computational content of proofs. Leveraging Minlog's built-in program extraction, we obtain executable terms that are exported as Haskell code.
  Efficiency of the extracted programs plays a central role. We show how performance considerations influence even the initial formulation of theorems and proofs. In particular, we compare formalizations based on binary encodings of natural numbers with those using the traditional unary (successor-based) representation.
  We present several core proofs in detail and reflect on the challenges that arise from formalization in contrast to informal reasoning. The complete formalisation is available online and linked for reference. Minlog's tactic scripts are designed to follow the structure of natural-language proofs, allowing each derivation step to be traced precisely and helping to bridge the gap between formal and classical mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Realizing the totally unordered structure of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present tools for analysing ordinals in realizability models of classical set theory built using Krivine's technique for realizability. This method uses a conservative extension of $ZF$ known as $ZF_{\varepsilon}$, where two membership relations co-exist, the usual one denoted $\in$ and a stricter one denoted $\varepsilon$ that does not satisfy the axiom of extensionality; accordingly we have two equality relations, the extensional one $\simeq$ and the strict identity $=$ referring to sets that satisfy the same formulas. We define recursive names using an operator that we call reish, and we show that the class of recursive names for ordinals coincides extensionally with the class of ordinals of realizability models. We show that reish$(\omega)$ is extensionally equal to omega in any realizability model, thus recursive names provide a useful tool for computing $\omega$ in realizability models. We show that on the contrary $\varepsilon$-totally ordered sets do not form a proper class and therefore cannot be used to fully represent the ordinals in realizability models. Finally we present some tools for preserving cardinals in realizability models, including an analogue for realizability algebras of the forcing property known as the $\kappa$-chain condition.</description>

      <title>First-Order Modal Logic via Logical Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the logical categories framework to first order modal logic. In our modal categories, modal operators are applied directly to subobjects and interact with the background factorization system. We prove a Joyal-style representation theorem into relational structures formalizing a `counterpart' notion. We investigate saturation conditions related to definability questions and we enrich our framework with quotients and disjoint sums, thus leading to the notion of a modal (quasi) pretopos. We finally show how to build syntactic categories out of first order modal theories.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of stronger lower bounds for NEXP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Around Paradox with Grounded Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we reason around logical paradoxes without falling into them? This paper introduces grounded deduction or GD, a Kripke-inspired approach to first-order logic and arithmetic that is neither classical nor intuitionistic, but nevertheless appears both pragmatically usable and intuitively justifiable. GD permits the direct expression of unrestricted recursive definitions -- including paradoxical ones such as 'L := not L' -- while adding dynamic typing premises to certain inference rules so that such paradoxes do not lead to inconsistency. This paper constitutes a preliminary development and investigation of grounded deduction, to be extended with further elaboration and deeper analysis of its intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Structures preserved by primitive actions of $S_\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dichotomy for structures $A$ that are preserved by primitive actions of $S_{\omega} = \text{Sym}({\mathbb N})$: either such a structure interprets all finite structures primitively positively, or it is of a very simple form and in particular has a binary polymorphism $f$ and an automorphism $\alpha$ satisfying $f(x,y) = \alpha(f(y,x))$. It is a consequence of our results that the constraint satisfaction problem for $A$ is in P or NP-complete.
  To prove our result, we study the first-order reducts of the Johnson graph $J(k)$, for $k \geq 2$, whose automorphism group $G$ equals the action of $S_{\omega}$ on the set $V$ of $k$-element subsets of $\mathbb N$. We use the fact that $J(k)$ has a finitely bounded homogeneous Ramsey expansion and that $G$ is a maximal closed subgroup of $\text{Sym}(V)$.</description>

      <title>Categories of orthosets and adjointable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orthoset is a non-empty set together with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation $\perp$, called the orthogonality relation. An orthoset with 0 is an orthoset augmented with an additional element 0, called falsity, which is orthogonal to every element. The collection of subspaces of a Hilbert space that are spanned by a single vector provides a motivating example.
  We say that a map $f \colon X \to Y$ between orthosets with 0 possesses the adjoint $g \colon Y \to X$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, $f(x) \perp y$ if and only if $x \perp g(y)$. We call $f$ in this case adjointable. For instance, any bounded linear map between Hilbert spaces induces a map with this property. We discuss in this paper adjointability from several perspectives and we put a particular focus on maps preserving the orthogonality relation.
  We moreover investigate the category OS of all orthosets with 0 and adjointable maps between them. We especially focus on the full subcategory iOS of irredundant orthosets with 0. iOS can be made into a dagger category, the dagger of a morphism being its unique adjoint. iOS contains dagger subcategories of various sorts and provides in particular a framework for the investigation of projective Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalised power series determined by linear recurrence relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1882, Kronecker established that a given univariate formal Laurent series over a field can be expressed as a fraction of two univariate polynomials if and only if the coefficients of the series satisfy a linear recurrence relation. We introduce the notion of generalised linear recurrence relations for power series with exponents in an arbitrary ordered abelian group, and generalise Kronecker's original result. In particular, we obtain criteria for determining whether a multivariate formal Laurent series lies in the fraction field of the corresponding polynomial ring. Moreover, we study distinguished algebraic substructures of a power series field, which are determined by generalised linear recurrence relations. In particular, we identify generalised linear recurrence relations that determine power series fields satisfying additional properties which are essential for the study of their automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>An ecumenical view of proof-theoretic semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debates concerning philosophical grounds for the validity of classical and intuitionistic logics often have the very nature of logical proofs as one of the main points of controversy. The intuitionist advocates for a strict notion of constructive proof, while the classical logician advocates for a notion which allows non-construtive proofs through reductio ad absurdum. A great deal of controversy still subsists to this day on the matter, as there is no agreement between disputants on the precise standing of non-constructive methods.
  Two very distinct approaches to logic are currently providing interesting contributions to this debate. The first, oftentimes called logical ecumenism, aims to provide a unified framework in which two "rival" logics may peacefully coexist, thus providing some sort of neutral ground for the contestants. The second, proof-theoretic semantics, aims not only to elucidate the meaning of a logical proof, but also to provide means for its use as a basic concept of semantic analysis. Logical ecumenism thus provides a medium in which meaningful interactions may occur between classical and intuitionistic logic, whilst proof-theoretic semantics provides a way of clarifying what is at stake when one accepts or denies reductio ad absurdum as a meaningful proof method.
  In this paper we show how to coherently combine both approaches by providing not only a medium in which classical and intuitionistic logics may coexist, but also one in which classical and intuitionistic notions of proof may coexist.</description>

      <title>Borel fields and measured fields of Polish spaces, Banach spaces, von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent articles in operator algebras make a nontrivial use of the theory of measurable fields of von Neumann algebras $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ and related structures. This includes the associated field $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ of automorphism groups and more general measurable fields of Polish groups with actions on Polish spaces. Nevertheless, a fully rigorous and at the same time sufficiently broad and flexible theory of such Borel fields and measurable fields is not available in the literature. We fill this gap in this paper and include a few counterexamples to illustrate the subtlety: for instance, for a Borel field $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ of von Neumann algebras, the field of Polish groups $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ need not be Borel.</description>

      <title>Adjointable maps between linear orthosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an (anisotropic) Hermitian space $H$, the collection $P(H)$ of at most one-dimensional subspaces of $H$, equipped with the orthogonal relation $\perp$ and the zero linear subspace $\{0\}$, is a linear orthoset and up to orthoisomorphism any linear orthoset of rank $\geq 4$ arises in this way. We investigate in this paper the correspondence of structure-preserving maps between Hermitian spaces on the one hand and between the associated linear orthosets on the other hand. Our particular focus is on adjointable maps.
  We show that, under a mild assumption, adjointable maps between linear orthosets are induced by quasilinear maps between Hermitian spaces and if the latter are linear, they are adjointable as well. Specialised versions of this correlation lead to Wigner-type theorems; we see, for instance, that orthoisomorphisms between the orthosets associated with at least $3$-dimensional Hermitian spaces are induced by quasiunitary maps.
  In addition, we point out that orthomodular spaces of dimension $\geq 4$ can be characterised as irreducible Fr\'echet orthosets such that the inclusion map of any subspace is adjointable. Together with a transitivity condition, we may in this way describe the infinite-dimensional classical Hilbert spaces.</description>
