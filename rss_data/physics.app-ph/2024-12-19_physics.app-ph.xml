      <title>Optical Coherence Elastography Measures Mechanical Tension in the Lens and Capsule in situ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lens tension is essential for accommodative vision but remains challenging to measure with precision. Here, we present an optical coherence elastography (OCE) technique that quantifies both the tension and elastic modulus of lens tissue and capsule. This method derives mechanical parameters from surface wave dispersion across a critical frequency range of 1-30 kHz. Using isolated lenses from six-month-old pigs, we measured intrinsic anterior capsular tensions of 0-20 kPa and posterior capsular tensions of 40-50 kPa, induced by intra-lenticular pressure at the cortical surface. Young's modulus (E) was 1.9 MPa for anterior capsules and 1.2 MPa for posterior capsules. Tensions in cortical tissue (E ~ 10 kPa) were below 1 kPa. Biaxial zonular stretching (~4% strain) increased anterior capsular tension from near zero to 64 kPa. This acousto-optical method holds significant promise for diagnosing and managing accommodative dysfunctions through lens mechanics assessment in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Formulation and its Relationship with TARC and Maximum Power Transfer Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13308v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous framework for analyzing arbitrary passive matching networks using a generalized Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent circuit. Unlike prior formulations, which often impose restrictive assumptions such as diagonal matching impedance matrices, our approach accommodates fully passive and interconnected multiport matching networks in their most general form. We first establish the mathematical conditions that any Linear Time Invarient, LTI, passive matching network must satisfy, starting from a $N \times N$ impedance matrix and continuing to $2N \times 2N$ and modified to follow the Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent network. Using the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem (MPTT), we derive the scattering matrix $\mathbf{S}$ explicitly, showing its general applicability to arbitrary impedance configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the connection between the Total Active Reflection Coefficient (TARC) and the MPTT, proving that the TARC is inherently tied to the power conservation principle of the MPTT. This formulation not only unifies existing approaches, but also broadens the scope of applicability to encompass arbitrary physical passive systems. The equations and relationships derived provide a robust mathematical foundation for analyzing complex multiport systems, including interconnected phased arrays and passive antenna networks.</description>

      <title>Boosting Magnetoacoustic Coupling with Spin Current in Ferromagnet/Nonmagnet/Ferromagnet Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) induced ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) is the critical principle of novel magnetoacoustic coupling devices, such as SAW non-reciprocal propagation and SAW-driven spin pumping. However, the enhancement of magnetoacoustic coupling is constrained by the attenuation of strain in magnetic thin films and the intricate manufacturing process of high-frequency SAW devices. This paper presents the observation of a pronounced enhancement in SAW-induced FMR within a ferromagnet/nonmagnet/ferromagnet (FM/NM/FM) multilayer structure deposited on a LiNbO3 piezoelectric substrate. This enhancement is driven by spin current transmission, facilitated by the non-parallel alignment of magnetizations between the two FM layers. The increased FMR response is evidenced by an elevated absorption of SAW energy by the magnetic layer, signifying improved magnetoacoustic coupling. This finding opens new avenues for advancing magnetoacoustic coupling devices, providing a pathway to enhanced control and functionality in applications that leverage magnetoacoustic interactions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Analysis of Retention Time of Coupled Memory Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been experimentally demonstrated that individual memory units coupled in certain topology can provide the intended performance. However, experimental or simulation based evaluation of different coupled memory topologies and materials are costly and time consuming. In this paper, inspired by Glauber dynamics models in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we propose a physically accurate generic mathematical framework for analyzing retention times of various coupled memory topologies and materials. We demonstrate efficacy of the proposed framework by deriving closed form expressions for a few popular coupled and uncoupled memory topologies, which match simulations. Our analysis also offers analytical insights helping us estimate the impact of materials and topologies on retention time.</description>

      <title>An introduction to reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of artificial neural networks that are implemented in a physical system. A major challenge in this context is that these networks are difficult to train since training here would require a change of physical parameters rather than simply of coefficients in a computer program. For this reason, reservoir computing, where one employs high-dimensional recurrent networks and trains only the final layer, is widely used in this context. In this chapter, I introduce the basic concepts of reservoir computing. Moreover, I present some important physical implementations coming from electronics, photonics, spintronics, mechanics, and biology. Finally, I provide a brief discussion of quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Long-Range Bessel Beams via Leaky Waves with Mitigated Open Stopband</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open stop-band (OSB) mitigation techniques are commonly used to improve the far-field radiating properties of leakywave antennas based on periodic structures. Recently, leaky waves have been proposed to focus energy in the near field through Bessel beams. However, the focusing character of Bessel beams is notably limited to a maximum distance known as the nondiffractive range. In this work, an OSB mitigation technique is originally exploited to significantly extend the nondiffractive range of a Bessel beam generated by a leaky-wave launcher in the microwave/millimeter-wave range. A comprehensive analysis of this device is presented, comparing the performance of the proposed launcher with the typical structure of a leaky-wave Bessel-beam launcher where the OSB is not suppressed. Theoretical results corroborated by full-wave simulations demonstrate that the proposed device, designed around 30 GHz, achieves an impressive nondiffractive range of approximately 25 m, which corresponds to 2500 vacuum wavelengths and to 50 times its aperture diameter of 50 cm. These results look particularly attractive for, e.g., near-field communications and wireless power transfer applications, where focusing energy in narrow spots and over large distances is a key factor.</description>

      <title>Spatial Optical Simulator for Classical Statistical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical simulators for the Ising model have demonstrated great promise for solving challenging problems in physics and beyond. Here, we develop a spatial optical simulator for a variety of classical statistical systems, including the clock, $XY$, Potts, and Heisenberg models, utilizing a digital micromirror device composed of a large number of tiny mirrors. Spins, with desired amplitudes or phases of the statistical models, are precisely encoded by a patch of mirrors with a superpixel approach. Then, by modulating the light field in a sequence of designed patterns, the spin-spin interaction is realized in such a way that the Hamiltonian symmetries are preserved. We successfully simulate statistical systems on a fully connected network, with ferromagnetic or Mattis-type random interactions, and observe the corresponding phase transitions between the paramagnetic, and the ferromagnetic or spin-glass phases. Our results largely extend the research scope of spatial optical simulators and their versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling the free-surface magnetohydrodynamics of thick liquid metal walls for fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renaissance Fusion proposes thick liquid metal walls as plasma-facing components for future commercial fusion reactors. It designs and operates proof-of-concept experiments aiming at actively suspending and stabilizing a flowing free-surface liquid metal layer against gravity using Lorentz forces. The first operating prototype consists of a 1 m-diameter chamber in the presence of a magnetic field of the order of 0.3 T. A GaInSn flow is injected inside the chamber, and it is actively suspended thanks to the injection of currents up to 3 kA. To simulate the prototype, a numerical tool capable of modeling magnetohydrodynamics phenomena in two-phase flows has been developed to reproduce and interpret the experimental results. The tool relies on the low-magnetic Reynolds assumption, implements the Volume-of-Fluid method for tracking the free-surface, and couples the electric potential in both fluid and solid domains.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Embedding Approach for Dynamics Modeling of Parallel Kinematic Manipulators with Hybrid Limbs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are characterized by closed kinematic loops, due to the parallel arrangement of limbs but also due to the existence of kinematic loops within the limbs. Moreover, many PKM are built with limbs constructed by serially combining kinematic loops. Such limbs are called hybrid, which form a particular class of complex limbs. Design and model-based control requires accurate dynamic PKM models desirably without model simplifications. Dynamics modeling then necessitates kinematic relations of all members of the PKM, in contrast to the standard kinematics modeling of PKM, where only the forward and inverse kinematics solution for the manipulator (relating input and output motions) are computed. This becomes more involved for PKM with hybrid limbs. In this paper a modular modeling approach is employed, where limbs are treated separately, and the individual dynamic equations of motions (EOM) are subsequently assembled to the overall model. Key to the kinematic modeling is the constraint resolution for the individual loops within the limbs. This local constraint resolution is a special case of the general \emph{constraint embedding} technique. The proposed method finally allows for a systematic modeling of general PKM. The method is demonstrated for the IRSBot-2, where each limb comprises two independent loops.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Stress States of Theoretically Modelled Polarimetric Measurements on Dielectric Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes a theoretical model of a reflective polarimetric measurement technique determining the surface stress of a dielectric material, e.g. glass. We have developed a procedure to reconstruct the actual stress state, which is the orientation and value of the principal axes of stress, from the calculated Stokes vector components that would appear as polarization signals in a measurement. We consider a special geometry of the principle stress axis, where we chose one of them to be perpendicular to the surface and relaxed to a zero value. Our new approach of reconstructing surface stress states from reflected polarization states embraces the determination of the reflection M\"uller matrix. With that and an initial Stokes vector, the resulting reflected Stokes vector is calculated to create a database. The database represents the dependence of the resulting Stokes vector on the initial Stokes vector and the stress states included in the reflection matrix, which is iteratively calculated for several stress components and its orientations. Introducing a model for the dependency of the reflected Stokes vector components on the stress states and fitting it to the database results in a system of equations of those dependencies which are solved for the stress state components and orientation. Finally, we found a theoretical determination accuracy of the model for surface stress magnitude to be of the order of a few MPa.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of 'Dunkelflaute' event detection methods considering grid operators' needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather conditions associated with low electricity production from renewable energy sources (RES) can result in challenging 'dunkelflaute' events, where 'dunkel' means dark and 'flaute' refers to low windspeeds. In a power system relying significantly on RES, such events can pose a risk for maintaining resource adequacy, i.e. the balance between generation and demand, particularly if they occur over a large geographical area and for an extended period of time. This risk is further emphasized in periods of cold ('kalte') temperature, known as 'kalte dunkelflaute'.
  In this paper, we perform a literature review of different methods to identify dunkelflaute events from hourly RES production and load data alone. We then validate three of these methods by comparing their results with periods of shortage identified from a detailed power system simulation model used by grid operators (ERAA2023). Strengths and weaknesses of these methods are discussed in terms of their data requirements, ease of application, and skill in detecting dunkelflaute events.
  We find that all three 'dunkelflaute' event detection methods have some ability to identify potential energy shortages, but none are able to detect all events. Most likely other factors such as the presence of energy storage capacity, non-weather-dependent outages, and model-related factors limit the skill of these methods. We find that all three methods perform best if the residual load is used as input, rather than hourly RES production or load alone. Overall, we find that Otero'22 is the method that yields the best results while being straightforward to implement and requiring only data with daily resolution. The results hold for countries relying on a small or a large share of RES production in their electricity mix.</description>

      <title>Ultra-directional and high-efficiency $\mu$LEDs via gradient index filled micro-Horn collimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-LEDs ($\mu$LEDs) are poised to transform AR/VR, display, and optical communication technologies, but they are currently hindered by low light extraction efficiency and non-directional emission. Our study introduces an innovative approach using a descending index multilayer anti-reflection coating combined with a horn collimator structure atop the $\mu$LED pixel. This design leverages the propagation of light outside the critical angle to enhance both the directionality and extraction efficiency of emitted light. By implementing either discrete or continuous refractive index gradients within the horn, we achieve a dramatic tenfold increase in light extraction within a $\pm$15$^\circ$ cone, with an overall light extraction efficiency reaching approximately 80%, where 31% of the power is concentrated within this narrow cone. This performance surpasses that of an optimized SiO2 half-ellipsoidal lens, which diameter and height is 24X and 26X larger than the pixel width respectively, while our design only slightly increases the device height and expands the final light escape surface to 3 times and roughly 4 times the pixel width respectively. Such efficiency, directionality enhancement, and compactness make this solution particularly suitable for high-resolution, densely packed $\mu$LED arrays, promising advancements in high-performance, miniaturized display systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Nonlinear Mechanics of Bio-inspired Materials Through Interface Engineering and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many biological materials such as nacre and bone, the material structure consists of hard grains and soft interfaces, with the interfaces playing a significant role in the material's mechanical behavior. This type of structures has been utilized in the design of various bio-inspired composite materials. Such applications often require the materials to exhibit a specified nonlinear stress-strain relationship. A key challenge lies in identifying appropriate interface properties from an infinite search space to achieve a given target stress-strain curve. This study introduces a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework specifically tailored for the inverse design of interfaces in bio-inspired composites. As a notable advantage, this method is capable of expanding the design space, allowing the discovery of optimal solutions even when the target curve deviates significantly from the initial dataset. Furthermore, our results show that BO can identify distinct interface designs that produce similar target stress-strain responses, yet differ in their deformation and failure mechanisms. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed BO framework to address a wide range of inverse design challenges in nonlinear mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Co-pilot for Screening of Organic Molecular Additives for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been extensively employed in planar perovskite photovoltaics to screen effective organic molecular additives, while encountering predictive biases for novel materials due to small datasets and reliance on predefined descriptors. Present work thus proposes an effective approach, Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener (Co-PAS), an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Co-PAS overcomes predictive biases by integrating the Molecular Scaffold Classifier (MSC) for scaffold-based pre-screening and utilizing Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder (JTVAE) latent vectors to enhance molecular structure representation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of power conversion efficiency (PCE) predictions. Leveraging Co-PAS, we integrate domain knowledge to screen an extensive dataset of 250,000 molecules from PubChem, prioritizing candidates based on predicted PCE values and key molecular properties such as donor number, dipole moment, and hydrogen bond acceptor count. This workflow leads to the identification of several promising passivating molecules, including the novel Boc-L-threonine N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (BTN), which, to our knowledge, has not been explored as an additive in PSCs and achieves a device PCE of 25.20%. Our results underscore the potential of Co-PAS in advancing additive discovery for high-performance PSCs.</description>

Abstract: The continuous growth in data volume has sparked interest in silicon-organic-hybrid nanophotonic devices integrated into silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). SOH devices offer improved speed and energy efficiency compared to silicon photonics devices. However, a comprehensive and accurate modeling methodology of SOH devices is lacking. While some preliminary modeling approaches for SOH devices exist, their reliance on theoretical and numerical methodologies, along with a lack of compatibility with electronic design automation (EDA), hinders their seamless and rapid integration with silicon PICs. Here, we develop a phenomenological, building-block-based SOH PICs simulation methodology spanning from the physics to the system level, offering high accuracy, comprehensiveness, and EDA-style compatibility. Our model is also readily integrable and scalable, lending itself to the design of large-scale silicon PICs. Our proposed modeling methodology is agnostic and compatible with any photonics-electronics co-simulation software. We validate this methodology by comparing experimentally demonstrated SOH microring modulators and Mach Zehnder modulators with those obtained through simulation, demonstrating its ability to model various modulator topologies. We also show our methodology's ease and speed in modeling large-scale systems. As an illustrative example, we use our methodology to design and study a 3-channel SOH MRM-based wavelength-division (de)multiplexer, a widely used component in various applications, including neuromorphic computing, data center interconnects, communications, and sensing. Our modeling approach is compatible with other materials exhibiting the Pockels and Kerr effects. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive physics-to-system-level EDA-compatible simulation methodology for SOH modulators.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle doping as a way to enhance holmium fiber lasers efficiency</title>

Abstract: Highly-doped holmium fibers have been prepared using modified chemical vapor deposition in combination with nanoparticle-doping method. Within a series of various Al2O3 and Ho3+ concentrations, relations between fibers composition and their fluorescence and laser parameters have been studied. Al/Ho molar ratio equal to at least 50 was found to be the key factor for fibers with outstanding parameters. Fibers with slope efficiency above 80%, laser threshold below 100 mW and fluorescence lifetime up to 1.6 ms have been prepared. Thanks to high Al2O3 concentrations, obtained through nanoparticle doping, we were able to achieve high-performance fibers in a wide range of Ho3+ concentrations. An output power of 19 W with 81% slope efficiency was reached using fiber with almost 4000 ppm of Ho3+ and 10 mol.% of Al2O3. This result is encouraging for highly efficient high-power cladding-pumped holmium fiber lasers, and studied relations between fibers composition and their laser parameters will be used in the designing of such laser sources.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional imaging of electromagnetic fields via light sheet fluorescence imaging with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to image electromagnetic fields holds key scientific and industrial applications, including electromagnetic compatibility, diagnostics of high-frequency devices, and experimental scientific work involving field interactions. Generally electric and magnetic field measurements require conductive elements which significantly distort the field. However, electromagnetic fields can be measured without altering the field via the shift they induce on Rydberg states of alkali atoms in atomic vapor, which are highly sensitive to electric fields. Previous field measurements using Rydberg atoms utilized electromagnetically induced transparency to read out the shift on the states induced by the fields, but did not provide spatial resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that electromagnetically induced transparency can be spatially resolved by imaging the fluorescence of the atoms. We demonstrate that this can be used to image $\sim$ V/cm scale electric fields in the DC-GHz range and $\sim$ mT scale static magnetic fields, with minimal distortion to the fields. We also demonstrate the ability to image $\sim$ 5 mV/cm scale fields for resonant microwave radiation and measure standing waves generated by the partial reflection of the vapor cell walls in this regime. With additional processing techniques like lock-in detection, we predict that our sensitivities could reach down to nV/cm levels. We perform this field imaging with a spatial resolution of 160 $\mu$m, limited by our imaging system, and estimate the fundamental resolution limitation to be 5 $\mu$m.</description>
