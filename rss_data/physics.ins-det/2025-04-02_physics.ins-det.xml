      <title>Optical surface reflectivity characterization in water Cherenkov detectors: methodologies and industrial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the optical properties of various components in water Cherenkov (WC) neutrino experiments is essential for accurate detector characterization, which is critical for precise measurements. Of particular importance is the characterization of surface reflectivity within the Cherenkov volume. We present a methodology for surface reflectivity characterization using a goniometer setup, addressing the challenges associated with measurements in the air and water (or other optical media). Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) measurements using a goniometer, including their industrial applications.</description>

      <title>New candidate polymeric wavelength shifters for noble liquid detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymeric wavelength shifters are of particular interest for large liquid argon detectors. Inspired by the success of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), other new polymers exhibiting a similar type of excimer fluorescence were investigated. We report on the preliminary results of the first cryogenic wavelength shifting test of a solution-cast film of PVN, poly(2-vinyl naphthalene). Significant brittleness was identified as a factor potentially limiting the use of PVN. However, clear signs of wavelength shifting were observed, with the overall efficiency and time response comparable to those of PEN.</description>

      <title>High-pressure Ion Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A High-Pressure Ion Trap operating at pressure ~1 Torr is a core component of the portable hand-held mass-spectrometric gas analyzer. A comprehensive mathematical model of the HPIT is described in this paper. The influence of the instrumental parameters (gas composition, pressure, and temperature; applied voltages; ion trap size and geometry) and ion properties (mass, diffusion, and mobility) on the ion trap analytical parameters (mass-spectral peak position, height, and width) is examined. The model explained the difference between a high-pressure and regular low-pressure ion trap.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Assessment of Sediment Accumulation Using Muography: A Pilot Run at the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of cosmic-ray muography as a non-invasive method to assess sediment accumulation and tidal influences in the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel, an immersed tube tunnel beneath the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. A portable, dual-layer plastic scintillator detector was deployed to conduct muon flux scans along the tunnel's length and to continuously monitor muon flux to study tidal effects. Geant4 simulations validated the correlation between muon attenuation and overburden thickness, incorporating sediment, water, and concrete layers. Key findings revealed an 11\% reduction in muon flux per meter of tidal water level increase, demonstrating a strong anti-correlation (correlation coefficient: -0.8) with tidal cycles. The results align with geotechnical data and simulations, especially in the region of interest, confirming muography's sensitivity to sediment dynamics. This work establishes muography as a robust tool for long-term, real-time monitoring of submerged infrastructure, offering significant advantages over conventional invasive techniques. The study underscores the potential for integrating muography into civil engineering practices to enhance safety and operational resilience in tidal environments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Neutron Irradiation on LGADs with a Carbon-Enriched Shallow Multiplication Layer: Degradation of Timing Performance and Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this radiation tolerance study, Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) with a carbon-enriched broad and shallow multiplication layer were examined in comparison to identical non-carbonated LGADs. Manufactured at IMB-CNM, the sensors underwent neutron irradiation at the TRIGA reactor in Ljubljana, reaching a fluence of $1.5e^{15} {n_{eq}} cm^{-2}$. The results revealed a smaller deactivation of boron and improved resistance to radiation in carbonated LGADs. The study demonstrated the potential benefits of carbon enrichment in mitigating radiation damage effects, particularly the acceptor removal mechanism, reducing the acceptor removal constant by more than a factor of two. Additionally, time resolution and collected charge degradation due to irradiation were observed, with carbonated samples exhibiting better radiation tolerance. A noise analysis focused on baseline noise and spurious pulses showed the presence of thermal-generated dark counts attributed to a too narrow distance between the gain layer end and the p-stop implant at the periphery of the pad for the characterized LGAD design; however, without significant impact of operation performance.</description>

      <title>Development of portable cosmic-ray muon detector array for muography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the multidisciplinary applications of cosmic-ray muons expand to large-scale and wide-area scenarios, the construction of cosmic-ray muon detector arrays has become a key solution to overcome the hardware limitations of individual detector. For muography, the array-based detector design enables fast-scanning of large target objects, allowing for rapid identification of density variation regions, which can improve the efficiency of tomography. This paper integrates scintillator detector technology with Internet of things (IoT) technology, proposing a novel array networking model for nationwide deployment. The model enables long-distance data collection and distribution, laying the foundation for future multidisciplinary applications such as muography and other fields.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>
