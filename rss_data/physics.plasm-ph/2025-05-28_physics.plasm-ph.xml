      <title>Geometry effects on zonal flow dynamics and turbulent transport in optimized stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global gyrokinetic simulations find a strong suppression of ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence by zonal flows in stellarators optimized for neoclassical transport. The reduction of the ITG transport by the zonal flows in quasi-helicalsymmetric (QH) and quasi-isodynamic (QI) stellarators are much larger than a quasi-axisymmetric (QA) stellarator or a tokamak, thanks to higher linear residual levels and lower nonlinear frequencies of the zonal flows in the QH and QI. The transport level and energy confinement time in the QH and QI are similar to the tokamak with the same size and temperature gradient, despite the much larger linear growth rates in the stellarators.</description>

      <title>From the Rose-DuBois Ansatz of Hot Spot Fields to the Instanton Solution: a Pedestrian Presentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper gives a pedestrian presentation of some technical results recently published in mathematical physics with non-trivial implications for laser-plasma interaction. The aim is to get across the main results without going into the details of the calculations, nor offering a specialist's user guide, but by focusing conceptually on how these results modify the commonly-held description -- in terms of laser hot spot fields -- of backscattering instabilities with a spatially smoothed laser beam. The intended readers are plasma physicists as well as graduate students interested in laser-plasma interaction. No prior knowledge of scattering instabilities is required. Step by step, we explain how the laser hot spots are gradually replaced with other structures, called instantons, as the amplification of the scattered light increases. In the amplification range of interest for laser-plasma interaction, instanton--hot spot complexes tend to appear in the laser field (in addition to the expected hot spots), with a non-negligible probability. For even larger amplifications and systems longer than a hot spot length, the hot spot field description is clearly invalidated by the instanton takeover.</description>

      <title>Electronegativity effects on plasma dynamics in He/O$_2$ RF microplasma jets at atmospheric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the transitions between ohmic mode and Penning-Gamma mode in a capacitively coupled radio frequency micro atmospheric pressure plasma jets (CCRF $\mu$APPJ) operated in He/O$_2$ mixtures by comparing phase-resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES) measurements of helium excitation with numerical simulations. The simulations employ a hybrid model that treats electrons kinetically via PIC/MCC, while ions and neutrals are modeled fluid dynamically. These results reveal that increasing electronegativity causes inhomogeneities in the bulk electric field, consequently modulating electron impact excitation dynamics. A good agreement was found between experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Intermittency in Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections Observed by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittency has been studied extensively in the fast and slow solar winds but to a far lesser extent in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). While ICMEs are often characterized by their relatively smooth, large-scale magnetic flux rope structures, a spectrum of fluctuations is nonetheless present at smaller scales. We have examined kurtosis and its scaling exponents at magnetohydrodynamic inertial scales in 49 ICMEs observed between 0.25 and 1 au by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, and compared the results to those obtained for the ICME sheath regions and ambient solar wind intervals. Kurtosis behaves similarly in all intervals studied and presents a universal behavior typical of intermittent time series. The ICMEs displayed a radially invariant level of intermittency, suggesting that they are relatively static, well-developed turbulent environments. In the sheath regions, the level of intermittency increased with distance, indicating that the turbulence is not yet fully developed at small heliocentric distances. In addition to intermittent fluctuations related to turbulence, the sheath regions may possess a population of non-turbulent structures that increase the absolute value of kurtosis.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations of Supra-Arcade Downflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their somewhat-frequent appearance in EUV imaging of off-limb flares, the origins of Supra-Arcade Downflows (SADs) remain a mystery. Appearing as dark, tendril-like downflows above growing flare loop arcades, SADs themselves are yet to be tied into the standard model of solar flares. The uncertainty of their origin is, in part, due to a lack of spectral observations, with the last published SAD spectral observations dating back to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory / Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SOHO/SUMER) era in 2003. In this work, we present new observations of SADs within an M-class solar flare on April 2nd, 2022, observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory. We measure Fe XXIV 192.02 Angstrom Doppler downflows and non-thermal velocities in the low-intensity SAD features, exceeding values measured in the surrounding flare fan. The ratio of temperature-sensitive Fe XXIV 255.11 Angstrom and Fe XXIII 263.41 Angstrom lines also allow the measurement of electron temperature, revealing temperatures within the range of the surrounding flare fan. We compare EIS line-of-sight Doppler velocities with plane-of-sky velocities measured by AIA, to construct the 3D velocity profile of four prominent SADs, finding evidence for their divergence above the flare loop arcade - possibly related to the presence of a high altitude termination shock. Finally, we detect 'stealth' SADs, which produce SAD-like Doppler signals, yet with no change in intensity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimisation of poloidal field coil positions in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tokamak is a world-leading concept for producing sustainable energy via magnetically-confined nuclear fusion. Identifying where to position the magnets within a tokamak, specifically the poloidal field (PF) coils, is a design problem which requires balancing a number of competing economic, physical, and engineering objectives and constraints. In this paper, we show that multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (BO), an iterative optimisation technique utilising probabilistic machine learning models, can effectively explore this complex design space and return several optimal PF coil sets. These solutions span the Pareto front, a subset of the objective space that optimally satisfies the specified objective functions. We outline an easy-to-use BO framework and demonstrate that it outperforms alternative optimisation techniques while using significantly fewer computational resources. Our results show that BO is a promising technique for fusion design problems that rely on computationally demanding high-fidelity simulations.</description>

      <title>Hyper Boris integrators for kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a family of numerical solvers for the nonrelativistic Newton--Lorentz equation in kinetic plasma simulations. The new solvers extend the standard 4-step Boris procedure, which has second-order accuracy in time, in three ways. First, we repeat the 4-step procedure multiple times, using an $n$-times smaller timestep ($\Delta t/n$). We derive a formula for the arbitrary subcycling number $n$, so that we obtain the result without repeating the same calculations. Second, prior to the 4-step procedure, we apply Boris-type gyrophase corrections to the electromagnetic field. In addition to a well-known correction to the magnetic field, we correct the electric field in an anisotropic manner to achieve higher-order ($N=2,4,6 \dots$th order) accuracy. Third, combining these two methods, we propose a family of high-accuracy particle solvers, the hyper Boris solvers, which have two hyperparameters of the subcycling number $n$ and the order of accuracy, $N$. The $n$-cycle $N$th-order solver gives a numerical error of $\sim (\Delta t/n)^{N}$ at affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Plasma-Based Compressor for Ultrafast Soft X-ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of intense, femtosecond-scale X-ray pulses is crucial for probing matter under extreme temporal and field conditions. Current chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) techniques in free-electron lasers (FELs), however, face efficiency limitations in the soft X-ray regime due to the inherent constraints of conventional optical compressors. To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm, and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across the soft X-ray to vacuum ultraviolet range. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high energy throughput. This approach overcomes the long-standing efficiency bottleneck of soft X-ray CPA and opens a scalable path toward compact, high-brightness attosecond FEL sources.</description>
