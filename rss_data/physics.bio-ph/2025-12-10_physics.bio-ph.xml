      <title>Metabolic rate beyond the 3/4 law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a discrete theoretical model in which basal metabolic rate \(B\) is described as a dynamic function of an organism's ontogenetic stage \(n\). Instead of treating \(B\) only as a static function of body mass \(M\), we adopt the form \(B(n) = B_0 \, M^{\,b(n)}\), in which the effective scaling exponent \(b(n)\) varies systematically throughout development. In contrast to classical approaches, such as Kleiber's empirical law (\(B \propto M^{3/4}\)) and the continuous fractal model of West--Brown--Enquist (WBE), which assume a constant exponent, the present framework emphasizes how the metabolic scaling relationship itself can evolve over the life cycle of a single individual. The model is inspired by a Fibonacci-based description of growth in discrete stages, leading to analytic expressions for \(b(n)\) that connect ontogenetic progression to changes in the scaling between metabolism and mass. In this setting, Kleiber's constant \(B_0 \approx 70\) kcal/day is reinterpreted as a \emph{metabolic anchoring point}, linking the classical law \(B \approx 70\,M^{3/4}\) to a developmentally explicit formulation. We show that the resulting trajectory \(B(n)\) captures, at a conceptual level, how metabolic scaling can shift from strongly sublinear behavior at early stages towards an almost linear regime as \(n\) increases, and that the predicted basal rates remain compatible, in order of magnitude, with values reported for mammals of different sizes. In this way, the work offers a unified framework that connects the evolution of \(B(n)\) across ontogeny to the recursive organization of biological growth.</description>

      <title>Frequency Locking to Environmental Forcing Suppresses Oscillatory Extinction in Phage-Bacteria Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteriophage-bacteria interactions are central to microbial ecology, influencing evolution, biogeochemical cycles, and pathogen behavior. Most theoretical models assume static environments and passive bacterial hosts, neglecting the joint effects of bacterial traits and environmental fluctuations on coexistence dynamics. This limitation hinders the prediction of microbial persistence in dynamic ecosystems such as soils and oceans.Using a minimal ordinary differential equation framework, we show that the bacterial growth rate and the phage adsorption rate collectively determine three possible ecological outcomes: phage extinction, stable coexistence, or oscillation-induced extinction. Specifically, we demonstrate that environmental fluctuations can suppress destructive oscillations through resonance, promoting coexistence where static models otherwise predict collapse. Counterintuitively, we find that lower bacterial growth rates are helpful in enhancing survival under high infection pressure, elucidating the observed post-infection growth reduction.Our studies reframe bacterial hosts as active builders of ecological dynamics and environmental variation as a potential stabilizing force. Our findings thus bridge a key theory-experiment gap and provide a foundational framework for predicting microbial responses to environmental stress, which might have potential implications for phage therapy, microbiome management, and climate-impacted community resilience.</description>

      <title>Enzyme-driven phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of polarized signaling domains on cell membranes is a fundamental example of biological pattern formation. While such patterns resemble structures from equilibrium phase separation, they are intrinsically non-equilibrium, driven by energy-consuming enzymatic cycles that switch molecules like phosphoinositides or small GTPases between distinct states. Here, we develop a minimal model of this enzyme-driven phase ordering process. Starting from microscopic reaction kinetics, we derive a mesoscopic theory that belongs to the class of active Model A with a global constraint. This framework yields an explicit mean-field phase diagram and closed-form expressions for key observables, such as interfacial tension, domain fractions, and phase coexistence boundaries, in terms of kinetic rates. In this context, phase coexistence is controlled by non-equilibrium parameters like catalytic rates and enzymatic asymmetry, rather than equilibrium parameters such as saturation concentrations. The resulting phase-separated domains rapidly exchange material with their surroundings. Their maintenance requires a continuous power input determined by enzymatic kinetics. The predicted phenomenology is consistent with experimental observations on reconstituted systems of phosphoinositide and Rab5 membrane patterning. We further study how metastable uniform states decay via nucleation of minority-phase domains and subsequent coarsening, driven by an effective interfacial tension. Using large deviation theory, we derive the critical nucleation radius under the action of the intrinsic, multiplicative chemical noise. The analytical results are quantitatively confirmed by stochastic simulations of the process. Our work provides a theoretical framework identifying key biochemical parameters controlling active phase separation on membrane scaffolds, offering testable predictions for experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Learning of Anomalous Diffusion with Wavelet Representations: Enabling Direct Learning from Experimental Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a versatile tool for analyzing anomalous diffusion trajectories, yet most existing pipelines are trained on large collections of simulated data. In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories. We associate this data efficiency with the emergence of distinct scale fingerprints disentangling underlying diffusion mechanisms in the wavelet spectra.</description>

      <title>Spreading processes on heterogeneous active systems: spreading threshold, immunization strategies, and vaccination noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spreading processes in two-dimensional systems of heterogeneous active agents that exhibit different individual active speeds. We obtain, combining kinetic and complex network theory, an analytical expression for the spreading threshold that depends not only on the first but also second moment of the speed distribution. Moreover, we prove that spreading can even occur for vanishing average active speed. Furthermore, we find that random vaccination strategies are ineffective in heterogeneous active systems, whereas targeted ones are effective. We also show that vaccination acts as (quenched) noise: it can decrease or increase the outbreak size. Our results offer insights into how information propagates in heterogeneous populations of active agents.</description>

      <title>Emergent memory in cell-like active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems across scales, ranging from molecular machines to human crowds, are usually modeled as assemblies of self-propelled particles driven by internally generated forces. However, these models often assume memoryless dynamics and no coupling of internal active forces to the environment. Here, guided by the example of living cells, which have recently been shown to display multi-timescale memory effects, we introduce a general theoretical framework that goes beyond this paradigm by incorporating internal state dynamics and environmental sensing into active particle models. We show that when the self-propulsion of an agent depends on internal variables with their own complex dynamics - modulated by local environmental cues - environmental memory spontaneously emerges and gives rise to new classes of behaviours. These include memory-induced responses, adaptable localization in complex landscapes, suppression of motility-induced phase separation, and enhanced jamming transitions. Our results demonstrate how minimal information processing capabilities, intrinsic to non-equilibrium agents with internal states like living cells, can profoundly influence both individual and collective behaviours. This framework bridges cell-scale activity and large-scale intelligent motion in cell assemblies, and opens the way to the quantitative analysis and design of systems ranging from synthetic colloids to biological collectives and robotic swarms.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: From empirical fits to mechanistic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate changes with temperature, but the mechanisms underlying these responses differ between different processes. Here, we bring together the main theoretical approaches used to describe temperature-rate relationships, ranging from empirical curve shapes to reaction-level kinetics and network-based dynamical frameworks. These models highlight how temperature influences not only the speed of elementary reactions, but also the behavior that emerges when many reactions interact through regulation, feedback, or stochastic transitions. By outlining the assumptions and implications of each perspective, we aim to clarify how different modeling strategies connect molecular processes to physiological temperature response curves and to point toward integrative frameworks that can better explain the diversity of biological thermal responses.</description>

      <title>Forces at the scale of the cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of molecular-scale forces in sculpting biological form and function has been acknowledged for more than a century. Accounting for forces in biology is a problem that lies at the intersection of soft condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, computer simulations and novel experimental methodologies, all adapted to a cellular context. This review surveys how forces arise within the cell. We provide a summary of the relevant background in basic biophysics, of soft-matter systems in and out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and of various force measurement methods in biology. We then show how these ideas can be incorporated into a description of cell-scale processes where forces are involved. Our examples include polymerization forces, motion of molecular motors, the properties of the actomyosin cortex, the mechanics of cell division, and shape changes in tissues. We show how new conceptual frameworks are required for understanding the consequences of cell-scale forces for biological function. We emphasize active matter descriptions, methodological tools that provide ways of incorporating non-equilibrium effects in a systematic manner into conceptual as well as quantitative descriptions. Understanding the functions of cells will necessarily require integrating the role of physical forces with the assimilation and processing of information. This integration is likely to have been a significant driver of evolutionary change.</description>

      <title>Practical protein-pocket hydration-site prediction for drug discovery on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating the practical utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for recurrent tasks in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery is of paramount importance. We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>

Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works \cite{supplem_pre,supplem_pre_math,supplem_prl}, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works~\cite{supplem_prl,supplem_pre,supplem_pre_force}.</description>

      <title>Resource and population dynamics in an agent-environment interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any ecosystem, the conditions of the environment and the characteristics of the species that inhabit it are entangled, co-evolving in space and time. We introduce a model that couples active agents with a dynamic environment, interpreted as a nutrient source. Agents are persistent random walkers that gather food from the environment and store it in an inner energy depot. This energy is used for self-propulsion, metabolic expenses, and reproduction. The environment is a two-dimensional surface divided into patches, each of them producing food. Thus, population size and resource distribution become emergent properties of the system. Combining simulations and analytical framework to analyze limiting cases, we show that the system exhibits distinct phases separating quasi-static and highly motile regimes. We observe that, in general, population sizes are inversely proportional to the average energy per agent. Furthermore, we find that, counter-intuitively, reduced access to resources or increased metabolic expenditure can lead to a larger population size. The proposed theoretical framework provides a link between active matter and movement ecology, allowing to investigate short vs long-term strategies to resource exploitation and rationing, as well as sedentary vs wandering strategy. The introduced approach may serve as a tool to describe real-world ecological systems and to test environmental strategies to prevent species extinction.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of \textit{Culex} population abundance and the impact of vector control interventions in a patchy environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent mosquito-borne outbreaks have revealed vulnerabilities in our abatement programmes, raising concerns about how abatement-districts should choose optimal future control strategies. Spatial dissemination of vector-borne disease is strongly shaped by the movement of both hosts and mosquitoes, creating substantial overlap between vector activity and pathogen spread. We developed a mathematical model for Culex mosquito dynamics in a patchy landscape, integrating entomological observations, weather-driven factors, and the vector control practices of the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District (NWMAD) in Cook County, Illinois. By coupling a temperature-driven multi-patch ODE model with NWMAD's adulticide and larvicide interventions, we investigated how spatial heterogeneity and control timing influence mosquito abundance. We also evaluated how mosquito dispersal modifies intervention effectiveness by comparing single-patch and two-patch model outcomes. Our results showed that models ignoring spatial connectivity can substantially overestimate the impact of interventions or misidentify the thresholds of vector persistence. Through numerical simulations, we analysed continuous and pulsatile control approaches under varying spatial and temporal configurations. These findings provide insight into optimal strategies for managing Culex populations and mitigating mosquito-borne disease risk in weather-driven, spatially connected environments across Cook County, Illinois.</description>

      <title>Surface Waves and Axoplasmic Pressure Waves in Action Potential Propagation: Fundamentally Different Physics or Two Sides of the Same Coin?</title>

Abstract: In this commentary, we argue that El Hady and Machta's "surface wave" model for mechanical waves accompanying action potential (AP) propagation describes the same underlying process as the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model introduced earlier by Rvachev. Both models describe mechanical modes that store potential energy in the elastic components of the axon (axonal membrane, cytoskeleton, bulk axoplasmic deformation), with kinetic energy carried by the axoplasmic fluid and axoplasmic viscosity playing a significant role. The "surface wave" model quantitatively considers driving by the traveling electrical depolarization wave of the AP, whereas the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model qualitatively considers driving not only by the AP's electrical depolarization but also by other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal actomyosin contractility. In addition, the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model considers mechanisms for synchronizing the depolarization wave and the pressure wave. Although derived using different approaches, the two models yield identical dependencies for the mechanical modes in key limits. The confusion in the literature, which treats these models as describing distinct processes, needs to be resolved to improve comprehensive understanding of the AP phenomenon and to guide future research.</description>

      <title>Physical Constraints on the Rhythmicity of the Biological Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the rhythmicity of KaiABC clock is generated from the underlying circuit. The phase diagram in terms of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a narrowly bounded oscillatory phase. As dictated by the cost-precision trade-offs of the thermodynamic uncertainty relations, the presence of intrinsic noise, amplified in small systems, demands higher energy cost to achieve greater rhythmic precision. The cost-minimizing condition giving rise to $\sim$21-hr rhythm is identified close enough to entrain the system to 24-hr environmental signals. An optimal level of intrinsic noise can induce oscillations beyond the Hopf bifurcation, effectively expanding the oscillatory phase. Our study clarifies how the physical factors, such as energy cost, stochastic noise, and regulatory mechanism, contribute to the operation of biological clocks.</description>
