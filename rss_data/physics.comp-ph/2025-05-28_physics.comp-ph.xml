      <title>Solving Boolean Satisfiability Problems Using A Hypergraph-based Probabilistic Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems are critical in fields such as artificial intelligence and cryptography, where efficient solutions are essential. Conventional probabilistic solvers often encounter scalability issues due to complex logic synthesis steps. In this work, we present a novel approach for solving the 3-SAT Boolean satisfiability problem using hypergraph-based probabilistic computers obtained through direct mapping. This method directly translates 3-SAT logical expressions into hypergraph structures, thereby circumventing conventional logic decomposition and synthesis procedures, and offering a more streamlined solver architecture. For a uf20-01 instance, our approach significantly reduces the vertex number from 112 to 20 with a reduced solution space from 2112 to 220. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed hypergraph-based solver achieves a significantly higher success rate of up to 99%, compared to merely 1% for conventional solvers. Furthermore, the proposed direct mapping method can be extended to solve k-SAT problems, which provides a scalable framework for tackling more complex satisfiability problems using probabilistic computing in the future.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Training of Quantum Circuit Classifiers Against Parameter Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing have spurred significant interest in harnessing its potential for speedups over classical systems. However, noise remains a major obstacle to achieving reliable quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a provably noise-resilient training theory and algorithm to enhance the robustness of parameterized quantum circuit classifiers. Our method, with a natural connection to Evolutionary Strategies, guarantees resilience to parameter noise with minimal adjustments to commonly used optimization algorithms. Our approach is function-agnostic and adaptable to various quantum circuits, successfully demonstrated in quantum phase classification tasks. By developing provably guaranteed optimization theory with quantum circuits, our work opens new avenues for practical, robust applications of near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability and Dynamics of Supersonic Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of shear layer instability in compressible flows is key to understanding phenomena from aerodynamics to astrophysical jets. Blumen's seminal paper [``Shear layer instability of an inviscid compressible fluid," J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 40}, 769--781 (1970)] established a linear stability framework for inviscid compressible shear flows, emphasizing velocity gradients and compressibility effects. However, the nonlinear regime remains insufficiently explored. This research extends Blumen's framework by conducting a weakly nonlinear stability analysis using the method of multiple scales to derive amplitude equations, such as the Landau-Stuart and complex Landau equations. Perturbation variables are expanded in a power series to capture amplitude evolution beyond linear theory. Finite boundary conditions are incorporated to enhance physical applicability. The study analyzes how compressibility and Mach number influence nonlinear saturation, revealing Mach-dependent bifurcations in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) with alternating stable and unstable regimes. Phase portraits and trajectories illustrate transitions, saturation, and spiral decay, which are relevant to astrophysical shear flows. Bifurcation analysis reveals both supercritical and subcritical Hopf behavior in compressible shear flows, underscoring the importance of nonlinear effects in the onset and evolution of flow instabilities. Qualitative and quantitative results of instability evolution have been shown from nonlinear stability analysis. This work bridges the critical gap between linear and fully nonlinear stability analyses by offering a systematic weakly nonlinear framework and the nonlinear dynamics for compressible shear layers. It generalizes the earlier linear results and provides new predictions about bifurcation behavior and long-time state selection in compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Polytropic Wind-Driven Bubbles and their Shock Structures in Radially Stratified Ambient Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the analytic expressions for polytropic wind-driven bubbles and their shock structures, formulated initially in Koo and McKee 1992(a,b), focusing on spherically symmetric configurations in astrophysical environments with $\rho\propto r^{-2}$, which arises naturally in the star-forming environment and has applications to winds flowing into a preexisting bubble. Wind luminosity is assumed to be constant, and as a result the shock velocities of these bubbles are constant in time. The ratio of specific heats is assumed to be the same in the shocked ambient medium and the shocked wind. Numerical results are presented for one selected ratio of wind density to ambient density. Exact ODEs are written for the compressed wind region and approximate solutions are found by fitting the ODE solutions. By analyzing the interactions between stellar winds and ambient media in the strong compression limit, we model the formation and evolution of spherical bubbles, highlighting their shock fronts and contact discontinuities. Our analytic method provides an intuitive approach to calculating the thickness of bubble shells, which is crucial for understanding their dynamics and observational characteristics. A numerical method explores conditions without explicitly requiring the strong compression limit, and then we compare numerical to analytical results under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Learning in Structural Dynamics: A Comprehensive Review and Emerging Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian learning has emerged as a compelling and vital research direction in the field of structural dynamics, offering a probabilistic lens to understand and refine the analysis of complex dynamical systems. This review meticulously traces the three-decade evolution of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics, illuminating core principles, groundbreaking methodologies, and diverse applications that have significantly influenced the field. The narrative commences by delving into the basics of Bayesian theory, clarifying essential concepts, and introducing primary methods for deriving posterior distributions, with an in-depth exploration of three types: Laplace approximation, stochastic sampling, and variational inference. Subsequently, the text explores the implementation of two types of Bayesian learning in structural dynamics: physical model learning and data-centric statistical model learning. Physical model learning emphasizes inferring physical model parameters within a Bayesian framework for system identification and prediction, while statistical model learning integrates Bayesian learning methodologies into data-centric statistical modeling within probabilistic machine learning. Both types resonate across various applications, such as modal analysis, model updating, damage detection, and reliability updating, highlighting their pivotal role in enhancing comprehension of dynamical systems and decision-making. The paper also navigates obstacles by proposing ways to enhance existing Bayesian inference strategies. Distinguished from previous research, this study offers a thorough examination of both traditional and cutting-edge Bayesian methods. It not only underscores the transformative influence of Bayesian approaches but also serves as a beacon, guiding researchers in the judicious selection and refinement of suitable methods for various challenges in structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Diverse Topological States in Ge Doped MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an ideal platform for studying interplays between symmetry, topology and magnetism, the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) MnBi2Te4 has attracted extensive attentions. However, its strong n-type intrinsic defects hinder the realizations of exotic phenomena. Stimulated by recent discoveries that Ge doping can efficiently tune the position of Fermi level, here we systematically investigate the band evolution and topological phase diagram with doping concentration from MTI MnBi2Te4 to strong topological insulator GeBi2Te4. Different from magnetically doped Bi2Se3, the topology here is determined by competition of two band inversions arising from band folding of two time-reversal invariant momenta between antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic unit cells. By employing a band momentum mapping method, besides the known MTI phase, remarkably, we find two classes of magnetic Dirac semimetal phases at antiferromagnetic state, two classes of Weyl semimetal phases at ferromagnetic state, and an intermediate trivial state at different doping regions. Interestingly, the trivial state can be tuned into a Weyl phase with two coexisting band inversions and extraordinarily long Fermi arcs by a small strain. Our work reveals diverse topological states with intrinsic quantum phenomena can be achieved with great potential for designing future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Does the Forced Van der Pol Oscillator Exhibit Irregular Behavior?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear oscillators are commonly encountered in a wide range of physical and engineering systems, exhibiting rich and complex dynamics. Among these, the Van der Pol oscillator is well known for its self-sustained limit cycle behavior. However, when subjected to external sinusoidal forcing, its dynamics can deviate significantly from this regular behavior. This study explores the emergence of complex dynamical regimes in the sinusoidally forced Van der Pol oscillator, focusing on identifying the transition from regular to aperiodic behavior. The primary research objective is to determine whether the system exhibits irregular dynamics such as quasi-periodicity or chaos and to identify the conditions under which these arise. We hypothesize that varying the amplitude and frequency ratio of the external forcing relative to the natural frequency of the oscillator can induce a spectrum of dynamical responses, including higher-order periodic and chaotic regimes. We perform numerical simulations using Python and examine the behavior of the system through time series analysis, phase portraits, and bifurcation diagrams to test this. The results demonstrate that as the forcing amplitude and frequency ratio are varied, the system undergoes transitions through periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic states. These findings highlight the complex nonlinear interactions in forced oscillatory systems and have significant implications for applications in biological rhythms, electronic circuits, and astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Modeling of the Solar Wind Flow with Boundary Conditions Governed by Synchronic Photospheric Magnetograms. I. Multi-point Validation in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind (SW) is a vital component of space weather, providing a background for solar transients such as coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions, and energetic particles propagating toward Earth. Accurate prediction of space weather events requires a precise description and thorough understanding of physical processes occurring in the ambient SW plasma. Ensemble simulations of the three-dimensional SW flow are performed using an empirically-driven magnetohydrodynamic heliosphere model implemented in the Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS). The effect of uncertainties in the photospheric boundary conditions on the simulation outcome is investigated. The results are in good overall agreement with the observations from the Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and OMNI data at Earth, specifically during 2020-2021. This makes it possible to shed more light on the properties of the SW propagating through the heliosphere and perspectives for improving space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Reduced order modelling of air puff test for corneal material characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model for the air puff test were analysed. Using Abaqus, the air puff test is applied to eyes with varying biomechanical parameters, such as material properties, corneal thickness, and radius. A reduced order model of the air puff (a turbulent impinging jet) has been acquired to decrease simulation time from 48 hours for the FSI model to approximately 12 minutes for the finite element analysis (FEA) model alone. To further accelerate simulations and improve model accuracy, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) will be integrated with the reduced-order model. This hybrid approach will help expand the model to a larger dataset, enhancing intraocular pressure (IOP) estimation accuracy and the corneal material properties algorithm through inverse FEA. Additionally, a neural network (NN) framework with embedded Gaussian-modulated waveforms is proposed to model the pressure and deformation distributions on the corneal surface as functions of spatial and temporal parameters. By learning the relationship between corneal biomechanical inputs such as Corneal Central Thickness (CCT), Intraocular Pressure (IOP), and baseline properties (Mu), and the governing coefficients of pressure and deformation, the network accurately reconstructs the result that matches well with the high-fidelity CFD data. This approach can quickly capture the distribution of pressure and deformation. It can also provide insights into the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of pressure and deformation, giving a more comprehensive understanding of fluid-structure interaction phenomena in the air puff test.</description>

      <title>Closing the Quantum-Classical Scaling Gap in Approximate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study (Ref. [1]), quantum annealing was reported to exhibit a scaling advantage for approximately solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). However, this claim critically depends on the choice of classical reference algorithm -- Parallel Tempering with Isoenergetic Cluster Moves (PT-ICM). Here, we reassess these findings with different classical paradigm -- Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM) -- that harnesses nonlinear Hamiltonian dynamics. By leveraging chaotic behavior rather than thermal fluctuations, SBM achieves comparable or superior scaling performance, effectively closing the previously reported quantum-classical gap. We show that small problem sizes analyzed in [1] are insufficient for inferring asymptotic scaling, due to sensitivity to runtime and hardware-specific factors. By extending the benchmark to larger instances -- beyond current quantum annealing capabilities -- we establish strong classical scaling behavior. And as a result, we conclude that it is unlikely that current generation of quantum annealers, can demonstrate supremacy in discrete approximate optimization under operationally meaningful conditions.</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Mean-Field Models via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of transformers to approximate the mean-field dynamics of interacting particle systems exhibiting collective behavior. Such systems are fundamental in modeling phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, including opinion formation, biological networks, and swarm robotics. The key characteristic of these systems is that the particles are indistinguishable, leading to permutation-equivariant dynamics. First, we empirically demonstrate that transformers are well-suited for approximating a variety of mean field models, including the Cucker-Smale model for flocking and milling, and the mean-field system for training two-layer neural networks. We validate our numerical experiments via mathematical theory. Specifically, we prove that if a finite-dimensional transformer effectively approximates the finite-dimensional vector field governing the particle system, then the $L_2$ distance between the \textit{expected transformer} and the infinite-dimensional mean-field vector field can be uniformly bounded by a function of the number of particles observed during training. Leveraging this result, we establish theoretical bounds on the distance between the true mean-field dynamics and those obtained using the transformer.</description>

      <title>Towards Signed Distance Function based Metamaterial Design: Neural Operator Transformer for Forward Prediction and Diffusion Model for Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse design of metamaterial architectures presents a significant challenge, particularly for nonlinear mechanical properties involving large deformations, buckling, contact, and plasticity. Traditional methods, such as gradient-based optimization, and recent generative deep-learning approaches often rely on binary pixel-based representations, which introduce jagged edges that hinder finite element (FE) simulations and 3D printing. To overcome these challenges, we propose an inverse design framework that utilizes a signed distance function (SDF) representation combined with a conditional diffusion model. The SDF provides a smooth boundary representation, eliminating the need for post-processing and ensuring compatibility with FE simulations and manufacturing methods. A classifier-free guided diffusion model is trained to generate SDFs conditioned on target macroscopic stress-strain curves, enabling efficient one-shot design synthesis. To assess the mechanical response of the generated designs, we introduce a forward prediction model based on Neural Operator Transformers (NOT), which accurately predicts homogenized stress-strain curves and local solution fields for arbitrary geometries with irregular query meshes. This approach enables a closed-loop process for general metamaterial design, offering a pathway for the development of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>Hyper Boris integrators for kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a family of numerical solvers for the nonrelativistic Newton--Lorentz equation in kinetic plasma simulations. The new solvers extend the standard 4-step Boris procedure, which has second-order accuracy in time, in three ways. First, we repeat the 4-step procedure multiple times, using an $n$-times smaller timestep ($\Delta t/n$). We derive a formula for the arbitrary subcycling number $n$, so that we obtain the result without repeating the same calculations. Second, prior to the 4-step procedure, we apply Boris-type gyrophase corrections to the electromagnetic field. In addition to a well-known correction to the magnetic field, we correct the electric field in an anisotropic manner to achieve higher-order ($N=2,4,6 \dots$th order) accuracy. Third, combining these two methods, we propose a family of high-accuracy particle solvers, the hyper Boris solvers, which have two hyperparameters of the subcycling number $n$ and the order of accuracy, $N$. The $n$-cycle $N$th-order solver gives a numerical error of $\sim (\Delta t/n)^{N}$ at affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithmic Way to Construct Boltzmann Machine Representations for Arbitrary Stabilizer Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.08631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have demonstrated considerable success as variational quantum states; however, their representational power remains incompletely understood. In this work, we present an analytical proof that RBMs can exactly and efficiently represent stabilizer code states (a class of highly entangled quantum states that are central to quantum error correction). Given a set of stabilizer generators, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine both the RBM architecture and the exact values of its parameters. Our findings provide new insights into the expressive power of RBMs, highlighting their capability to encode highly entangled states, and may serve as a useful tool for the classical simulation of quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Fast meta-solvers for 3D complex-shape scatterers using neural operators trained on a non-scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional target identification using scattering techniques requires high accuracy solutions and very fast computations for real-time predictions in some critical applications. We first train a deep neural operator~(DeepONet) to solve wave propagation problems described by the Helmholtz equation in a domain \textit{without scatterers} but at different wavenumbers and with a complex absorbing boundary condition. We then design two classes of fast meta-solvers by combining DeepONet with either relaxation methods, such as Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, or with Krylov methods, such as GMRES and BiCGStab, using the trunk basis of DeepONet as a coarse-scale preconditioner. We leverage the spectral bias of neural networks to account for the lower part of the spectrum in the error distribution while the upper part is handled inexpensively using relaxation methods or fine-scale preconditioners. The meta-solvers are then applied to solve scattering problems with different shape of scatterers, at no extra training cost. We first demonstrate that the resulting meta-solvers are shape-agnostic, fast, and robust, whereas the standard standalone solvers may even fail to converge without the DeepONet. We then apply both classes of meta-solvers to scattering from a submarine, a complex three-dimensional problem. We achieve very fast solutions, especially with the DeepONet-Krylov methods, which require orders of magnitude fewer iterations than any of the standalone solvers.</description>

      <title>Generator of Neural Network Potential for Molecular Dynamics: Constructing Robust and Accurate Potentials with Active Learning for Nanosecond-scale Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing &gt;10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with &gt;10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary geometries. GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>TorchGDM: A GPU-Accelerated Python Toolkit for Multi-Scale Electromagnetic Scattering with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present "torchGDM", a numerical framework for nano-optical simulations based on the Green's Dyadic Method (GDM). This toolkit combines a hybrid approach, allowing for both fully discretized nano-structures and structures approximated by sets of effective electric and magnetic dipoles. It supports simulations in three dimensions and for infinitely long, two-dimensional structures. This capability is particularly suited for multi-scale modeling, enabling accurate near-field calculations within or around a discretized structure embedded in a complex environment of scatterers represented by effective models. Importantly, torchGDM is entirely implemented in PyTorch, a well-optimized and GPU-enabled automatic differentiation framework. This allows for the efficient calculation of exact derivatives of any simulated observable with respect to various inputs, including positions, wavelengths or permittivity, but also intermediate parameters like Green's tensors. We anticipate that this toolkit will be valuable for applications merging nano-photonics and machine learning, as well as for solving nano-photonic optimization and inverse problems, such as the global design and characterization of metasurfaces, where optical interactions between structures are critical.</description>

      <title>Nature-inspired optimization, the Philippine Eagle, and cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

      <title>Maxwell \`a la Helmholtz: Electromagnetic scattering by 3D perfect electric conductors via Helmholtz integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of indirect boundary integral equation (BIE) formulations for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems involving smooth perfectly electric conductors (PECs) in three-dimensions. These combined-field-type BIE formulations rely exclusively on classical Helmholtz boundary operators, resulting in provably well-posed, frequency-robust, Fredholm second-kind BIEs. Notably, we prove that the proposed formulations are free from spurious resonances, while retaining the versatility of Helmholtz integral operators. The approach is based on the equivalence between the Maxwell PEC scattering problem and two independent vector Helmholtz boundary value problems for the electric and magnetic fields, with boundary conditions defined in terms of the Dirichlet and Neumann traces of the corresponding vector Helmholtz solutions. While certain aspects of this equivalence (for the electric field) have been previously exploited in the so-called field-only BIE formulations, we here rigorously establish and generalize the equivalence between Maxwell and Helmholtz problems for both fields. Finally, a variety of numerical examples highlights the robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach when combined with Density Interpolation-based Nystr\"om methods and fast linear algebra solvers, implemented in the open-source Julia package Inti$.$jl.</description>
