      <title>Split Lemma and First Isomorphism Theorem for groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groupoids are the oidification of groups, and they are largely used in topology and representation theory. We consider here the category $\mathsf{Gpd}$ of all groupoids with all morphisms, and the category $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$ of groupoids over a fixed set of vertices $\Lambda$, with morphisms fixing $\Lambda$.
  Famously, the First Isomorphism Theorem fails to hold in $\mathsf{Gpd}$. However, we retrieve here a universally lifted version of the First Isomorphism Theorem in $\mathsf{Gpd}$, through the definition of virtual kernels. In $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$ instead, a First Isomorphism Theorem is already known from \'Avila, Mar\'in, and Pinedo (2020).
  Semidirect products of a group by a groupoid are well known. We define crossed products in $\mathsf{Gpd}$, and prove that they are equivalent to split epimorphisms. We observe that in $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$ crossed products and semidirect products are essentially equivalent, under mild assumptions, and our Split Lemma in $\mathsf{Gpd}$ collapses to a much simpler Split Lemma in $\mathsf{Gpd}_\Lambda$. This latter one, in turn, under some mild extra assumptions, implies a Split Lemma by Ibort and Marmo (2023).</description>

      <title>Skew braces and Rota-Baxter operators on semi-direct products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13959v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the connections between (relative) Rota-Baxter groups, skew left braces, and enlargements of these structures on naturally associated semi-direct products. For any skew left brace, we introduce a new skew left brace, called the square, on the natural semi-direct product of its additive and multiplicative groups. Further, the square construction turns out to be distinct from the previously known double construction arising as a special case of matched pairs of skew braces. This provides a method to construct a new bijective, non-degenerate solution to the Yang-Baxter equation from an existing solution arising from a skew left brace. We show that the square construction is functorial and integrates naturally into both the cohomological and extension-theoretic frameworks for (relative) Rota-Baxter groups and skew left braces. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient condition under which two isoclinic skew left braces yield isoclinic squares.</description>

      <title>On the dynamics of endomorphisms of the direct product of two free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Brinkmann's problems are decidable for endomorphisms of $F_n\times F_m$: given $(x,y),(z,w)\in F_n\times F_m$ and $\Phi\in \text{End}(F_n\times F_m)$, it is decidable whether there is some $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $(x,y)\Phi^k=(z,w)$ (or $(x,y)\Phi^k\sim(z,w)$). We also prove decidability of a two-sided version of Brinkmann's conjugacy problem for injective endomorphisms which, from the work of Logan, yields a solution to the conjugacy problem in ascending HNN-extensions of $F_n\times F_m$. Finally, we study the dynamics of automorphisms of $F_n\times F_m$ at the infinity, proving that that their dynamics at the infinity is asymptotically periodic, as occurs in the free and free-abelian times free cases.</description>

      <title>The Pants Graph of a Free Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a pants decomposition for a finitely generated free group and construct the corresponding pants graph. A pants decomposition of a free group leads to the formation of a simplicial graph, referred to as the pants graph of a free group, consisting of all possible pants decompositions.The natural isometric action of the outer automorphism group of the free group on the pants graph induces a coarsely surjective orbit map.Additionally, we construct a coarsely Lipschitz map from the pants graph to the free splitting complex. These results imply that the pants graph of a free group is both connected and unbounded.</description>

      <title>Stationary measures and random walks on $\tilde{A}_2$-buildings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a non-elementary group action $G \curvearrowright X$ of a locally compact second countable group $G$ on a possibly exotic non-discrete affine building $X$ of type $\tilde{A}_2$. We prove that if $\mu$ is an admissible symmetric probability measure on $G$, there is a unique $\mu$-stationary measure supported on the chambers of the spherical building at infinity. We use this result to study random walks induced by the $G$-action, and we prove that if $\mu$ has finite second moment, $(Z_n o)$ converges almost surely to a regular point of the boundary and the Lyapunov spectrum of the random walk is simple. Applied to Bruhat-Tits buildings, these results extend some classical theorems due to H.~Furstenberg.</description>

      <title>On the $\ell^2$-Betti numbers and algebraic fibring of the (outer) automorphism group of a right-angled Artin group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the first $\ell^2$-Betti number of the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of arbitrary right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs), providing a complete characterization of when it is non-zero. In addition, we determine all $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of the outer automorphism group in the case where the defining graph is disconnected and the associated RAAG is not isomorphic to a free group. We also analyse the algebraic fibring of the pure symmetric automorphism groups $\mathrm{PSA}(A_\Gamma)$ and $\mathrm{PSO}(A_\Gamma)$ and the virtual algebraic fibring of $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ in the case when $A_\Gamma$ admits no non-inner partial conjugation. In the transvection-free case, we show that $\beta_1^{(2)}(\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)) = 0$ if and only if $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ virtually fibres.</description>

      <title>Minimal operations over permutation groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the possible types of minimal operations above an arbitrary permutation group. Above the trivial group, a theorem of Rosenberg yields that there are five types of minimal operations. We show that above any non-trivial permutation group there are at most four such types. Indeed, except above Boolean groups acting freely on a set, there are only three. In particular, this is the case for oligomorphic permutation groups, for which we improve a result of Bodirsky and Chen by showing one of the types in their classification does not exist. Building on these results, we answer three questions of Bodirsky that were previously open.</description>

      <title>Connections between conjugation quandles and their underlying groups via residual finiteness and the Hopf property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a conjugation quandle is Hopfian, then its underlying group is also Hopfian. We also show that the converse does not hold by providing an example. This highlights a distinction between conjugation quandles and their underlying groups. While a recent result shows that every hyperbolic group is Hopfian, conjugation quandles of hyperbolic groups can still be non-Hopfian. Furthermore, we examine conjugation quandles of Baumslag-Solitar groups. We show that these quandles are infinitely generated. Hence, to apply the result that every finitely generated residually finite quandle is Hopfian, it is necessary to work with finitely generated quandles. For this purpose, we employ Dehn quandles as subquandles, which allow us to fully characterize the residual finiteness of conjugation quandles of the Baumslag-Solitar groups.</description>

Abstract: We construct a description of graded derivations in group algebras. Using this result for arbitrary graduation of the group algebra, we describe all possible structures of DG algebras.

      <title>Classifying integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5 and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a Grothendieck ring as a fusion ring categorifiable into a fusion category over the complex field. An integral fusion ring is called Drinfeld if all its formal codegrees are integers dividing the global Frobenius--Perron dimension. Every integral Grothendieck ring is necessarily Drinfeld.
  Using the fact that the formal codegrees of integral Drinfeld rings form an Egyptian fraction summing to 1, we derive a finite list of possible global FPdims for small ranks. Applying Normaliz, we classify all fusion rings with these candidate FPdims, retaining only those admitting a Drinfeld structure. To exclude Drinfeld rings that are not Grothendieck rings, we analyze induction matrices to the Drinfeld center, classified via our new Normaliz feature. Further exclusions and constructions involve group-theoretical fusion categories and Schur multipliers.
  Our main result is a complete classification of integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5, extended to rank 7 in odd-dimensional and noncommutative cases using Frobenius--Schur indicators and Galois theory. Moreover, we show that any noncommutative, odd-dimensional, integral Grothendieck ring of rank at most 22 is pointed of rank 21.
  We also classify all integral 1-Frobenius Drinfeld rings of rank 6, identify the first known non-Isaacs integral fusion category (which turns out to be group-theoretical), classify integral noncommutative Drinfeld rings of rank 8, and integral 1-Frobenius MNSD Drinfeld rings of rank 9. Finally, we determine the smallest-rank exotic simple integral fusion rings: rank 4 in general, rank 6 in the Drinfeld case, and rank 7 in the 1-Frobenius Drinfeld case.</description>

      <title>Group-averaged Markov chains: mixing improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Markov kernels $P$ on a general state space $\mathcal{X}$, we introduce a new class of averaged Markov kernels $P_{da}(G,\nu)$ of $P$ induced by a group $G$ that acts on $\mathcal{X}$ and a probability measure $\nu$ on $G \times G$. Notable special cases are the group-orbit average $\overline{P}$, left-average $P_{la}$, right-average $P_{ra}$ and the independent-double-average $(P_{la})_{ra}$. For $\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\pi$ is invariant with respect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence properties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic variance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in general $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$ are comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la}, P_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over $(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric interpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific $G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in the general case if $\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and study a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels which generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and applications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast state-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or piecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but also enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings, achieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\pi$ is the discrete uniform distribution.</description>
