      <title>Pneumonia Diagnosis through pixels -- A Deep Learning Model for detection and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual identification and classification of pneumonia and COVID-19 infection is a cumbersome process that, if delayed can cause irreversible damage to the patient. We have compiled CT scan images from various sources, namely, from the China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investigation (CC-CCII), the Negin Radiology located at Sari in Iran, an open access COVID-19 repository from Havard dataverse, and Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India. The images were preprocessed using various methods such as normalization, sharpening, median filter application, binarizing, and cropping to ensure uniformity while training the models. We present an ensemble classification approach using deep learning and machine learning methods to classify patients with the said diseases. Our ensemble model uses pre-trained networks such as ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 for classification and MobileNetV2 for feature extraction. The features from MobileNetV2 are used by the gradient-boosting classifier for the classification of patients. Using ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and the MobileNetV2 aided gradient boosting classifier, we propose an ensemble model with an accuracy of 98 percent on unseen data.</description>

      <title>Soil Fertility Prediction Using Combined USB-microscope Based Soil Image, Auxiliary Variables, and Portable X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explored the application of portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry and soil image analysis to rapidly assess soil fertility, focusing on critical parameters such as available B, organic carbon (OC), available Mn, available S, and the sulfur availability index (SAI). Analyzing 1,133 soil samples from various agro-climatic zones in Eastern India, the research combined color and texture features from microscopic soil images, PXRF data, and auxiliary soil variables (AVs) using a Random Forest model. Results indicated that integrating image features (IFs) with auxiliary variables (AVs) significantly enhanced prediction accuracy for available B (R^2 = 0.80) and OC (R^2 = 0.88). A data fusion approach, incorporating IFs, AVs, and PXRF data, further improved predictions for available Mn and SAI with R^2 values of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively. The study demonstrated how these integrated technologies have the potential to provide quick and affordable options for soil testing, opening up access to more sophisticated prediction models and a better comprehension of the fertility and health of the soil. Future research should focus on the application of deep learning models on a larger dataset of soil images, developed using soils from a broader range of agro-climatic zones under field condition.</description>

      <title>Plane-wave compounding with adaptive joint coherence factor weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) is widely used for ultrasound imaging. This technique involves sending plane waves into a sample at different transmit angles and recording the resultant backscattered echo at different receive positions. The time-delayed signals from the different combinations of transmit angles and receive positions are then coherently summed to produce a beamformed image. Various techniques have been developed to characterize the quality of CPWC beamforming based on the measured coherence across the transmit or receive apertures. Here, we propose a more fine-grained approach where the signals from every transmit/receive combination are separately evaluated using a quality metric based on their joint spatio-angular coherence. The signals are then individually weighted according to their measured Joint Coherence Factor (JCF) prior to being coherently summed. To facilitate the comparison of JCF beamforming compared to alternative techniques, we further propose a method of image display standardization based on contrast matching. We show results from tissue-mimicking phantoms and human soft-tissue imaging. Fine-grained JCF weighting is found to improve CPWC image quality compared to alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>F2FLDM: Latent Diffusion Models with Histopathology Pre-Trained Embeddings for Unpaired Frozen Section to FFPE Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Frozen Section (FS) technique is a rapid and efficient method, taking only 15-30 minutes to prepare slides for pathologists' evaluation during surgery, enabling immediate decisions on further surgical interventions. However, FS process often introduces artifacts and distortions like folds and ice-crystal effects. In contrast, these artifacts and distortions are absent in the higher-quality formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides, which require 2-3 days to prepare. While Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods have been used to translate FS to FFPE images (F2F), they may leave morphological inaccuracies with remaining FS artifacts or introduce new artifacts, reducing the quality of these translations for clinical assessments. In this study, we benchmark recent generative models, focusing on GANs and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), to overcome these limitations. We introduce a novel approach that combines LDMs with Histopathology Pre-Trained Embeddings to enhance restoration of FS images. Our framework leverages LDMs conditioned by both text and pre-trained embeddings to learn meaningful features of FS and FFPE histopathology images. Through diffusion and denoising techniques, our approach not only preserves essential diagnostic attributes like color staining and tissue morphology but also proposes an embedding translation mechanism to better predict the targeted FFPE representation of input FS images. As a result, this work achieves a significant improvement in classification performance, with the Area Under the Curve rising from 81.99% to 94.64%, accompanied by an advantageous CaseFD. This work establishes a new benchmark for FS to FFPE image translation quality, promising enhanced reliability and accuracy in histopathology FS image analysis.

      <title>Improving Pediatric Pneumonia Diagnosis with Adult Chest X-ray Images Utilizing Contrastive Learning and Embedding Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the advancement of deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for pneumonia from adult chest x-ray (CXR) images, the performance of CAD methods applied to pediatric images remains suboptimal, mainly due to the lack of large-scale annotated pediatric imaging datasets. Establishing a proper framework to leverage existing adult large-scale CXR datasets can thus enhance pediatric pneumonia detection performance. In this paper, we propose a three-branch parallel path learning-based framework that utilizes both adult and pediatric datasets to improve the performance of deep learning models on pediatric test datasets. The paths are trained with pediatric only, adult only, and both types of CXRs, respectively. Our proposed framework utilizes the multi-positive contrastive loss to cluster the classwise embeddings and the embedding similarity loss among these three parallel paths to make the classwise embeddings as close as possible to reduce the effect of domain shift. Experimental evaluations on open-access adult and pediatric CXR datasets show that the proposed method achieves a superior AUROC score of 0.8464 compared to 0.8348 obtained using the conventional approach of join training on both datasets. The proposed approach thus paves the way for generalized CAD models that are effective for both adult and pediatric age groups.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</description>

      <title>Nuclei Instance Segmentation of Cryosectioned H&amp;E Stained Histological Images using Triple U-Net Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation is crucial in oncological diagnosis and cancer pathology research. H&amp;E stained images are commonly used for medical diagnosis, but pre-processing is necessary before using them for image processing tasks. Two principal pre-processing methods are formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE) and frozen tissue samples (FS). While FFPE is widely used, it is time-consuming, while FS samples can be processed quickly. Analyzing H&amp;E stained images derived from fast sample preparation, staining, and scanning can pose difficulties due to the swift process, which can result in the degradation of image quality. This paper proposes a method that leverages the unique optical characteristics of H&amp;E stained images. A three-branch U-Net architecture has been implemented, where each branch contributes to the final segmentation results. The process includes applying watershed algorithm to separate overlapping regions and enhance accuracy. The Triple U-Net architecture comprises an RGB branch, a Hematoxylin branch, and a Segmentation branch. This study focuses on a novel dataset named CryoNuSeg. The results obtained through robust experiments outperform the state-of-the-art results across various metrics. The benchmark score for this dataset is AJI 52.5 and PQ 47.7, achieved through the implementation of U-Net Architecture. However, the proposed Triple U-Net architecture achieves an AJI score of 67.41 and PQ of 50.56. The proposed architecture improves more on AJI than other evaluation metrics, which further justifies the superiority of the Triple U-Net architecture over the baseline U-Net model, as AJI is a more strict evaluation metric. The use of the three-branch U-Net model, followed by watershed post-processing, significantly surpasses the benchmark scores, showing substantial improvement in the AJI score</description>

      <title>RadRotator: 3D Rotation of Radiographs with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming two-dimensional (2D) images into three-dimensional (3D) volumes is a well-known yet challenging problem for the computer vision community. In the medical domain, a few previous studies attempted to convert two or more input radiographs into computed tomography (CT) volumes. Following their effort, we introduce a diffusion model-based technology that can rotate the anatomical content of any input radiograph in 3D space, potentially enabling the visualization of the entire anatomical content of the radiograph from any viewpoint in 3D. Similar to previous studies, we used CT volumes to create Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) as the training data for our model. However, we addressed two significant limitations encountered in previous studies: 1. We utilized conditional diffusion models with classifier-free guidance instead of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve higher mode coverage and improved output image quality, with the only trade-off being slower inference time, which is often less critical in medical applications; and 2. We demonstrated that the unreliable output of style transfer deep learning (DL) models, such as Cycle-GAN, to transfer the style of actual radiographs to DRRs could be replaced with a simple yet effective training transformation that randomly changes the pixel intensity histograms of the input and ground-truth imaging data during training. This transformation makes the diffusion model agnostic to any distribution variations of the input data pixel intensity, enabling the reliable training of a DL model on input DRRs and applying the exact same model to conventional radiographs (or DRRs) during inference.</description>

      <title>A New Multi-Picture Architecture for Learned Video Deinterlacing and Demosaicing with Parallel Deformable Convolution and Self-Attention Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the fact real-world video deinterlacing and demosaicing are well-suited to supervised learning from synthetically degraded data because the degradation models are known and fixed, learned video deinterlacing and demosaicing have received much less attention compared to denoising and super-resolution tasks. We propose a new multi-picture architecture for video deinterlacing or demosaicing by aligning multiple supporting pictures with missing data to a reference picture to be reconstructed, benefiting from both local and global spatio-temporal correlations in the feature space using modified deformable convolution blocks and a novel residual efficient top-$k$ self-attention (kSA) block, respectively. Separate reconstruction blocks are used to estimate different types of missing data. Our extensive experimental results, on synthetic or real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed novel architecture provides superior results that significantly exceed the state-of-the-art for both tasks in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality. Ablation studies are provided to justify and show the benefit of each novel modification made to the deformable convolution and residual efficient kSA blocks.

      <title>SPIdepth: Strengthened Pose Information for Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has garnered considerable attention for its applications in autonomous driving and robotics. While recent methods have made strides in leveraging techniques like the Self Query Layer (SQL) to infer depth from motion, they often overlook the potential of strengthening pose information. In this paper, we introduce SPIdepth, a novel approach that prioritizes enhancing the pose network for improved depth estimation. Building upon the foundation laid by SQL, SPIdepth emphasizes the importance of pose information in capturing fine-grained scene structures. By enhancing the pose network's capabilities, SPIdepth achieves remarkable advancements in scene understanding and depth estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as KITTI and Cityscapes showcase SPIdepth's state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by significant margins. Notably, SPIdepth's performance exceeds that of unsupervised models and, after finetuning on metric data, outperforms all existing methods. Remarkably, SPIdepth achieves these results using only a single image for inference, surpassing even methods that utilize video sequences for inference, thus demonstrating its efficacy and efficiency in real-world applications. Our approach represents a significant leap forward in self-supervised monocular depth estimation, underscoring the importance of strengthening pose information for advancing scene understanding in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>MambaMOS: LiDAR-based 3D Moving Object Segmentation with Motion-aware State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based Moving Object Segmentation (MOS) aims to locate and segment moving objects in point clouds of the current scan using motion information from previous scans. Despite the promising results achieved by previous MOS methods, several key issues, such as the weak coupling of temporal and spatial information, still need further study. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D Moving Object Segmentation with Motion-aware State Space Model, termed MambaMOS. Firstly, we develop a novel embedding module, the Time Clue Bootstrapping Embedding (TCBE), to enhance the coupling of temporal and spatial information in point clouds and alleviate the issue of overlooked temporal clues. Secondly, we introduce the Motion-aware State Space Model (MSSM) to endow the model with the capacity to understand the temporal correlations of the same object across different time steps. Specifically, MSSM emphasizes the motion states of the same object at different time steps through two distinct temporal modeling and correlation steps. We utilize an improved state space model to represent these motion differences, significantly modeling the motion states. Finally, extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI-MOS and KITTI-Road benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MambaMOS achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code of this work will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Terminal-K/MambaMOS.</description>

      <title>Linearly-evolved Transformer for Pan-sharpening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision transformer family has dominated the satellite pan-sharpening field driven by the global-wise spatial information modeling mechanism from the core self-attention ingredient. The standard modeling rules within these promising pan-sharpening methods are to roughly stack the transformer variants in a cascaded manner. Despite the remarkable advancement, their success may be at the huge cost of model parameters and FLOPs, thus preventing its application over low-resource satellites.To address this challenge between favorable performance and expensive computation, we tailor an efficient linearly-evolved transformer variant and employ it to construct a lightweight pan-sharpening framework. In detail, we deepen into the popular cascaded transformer modeling with cutting-edge methods and develop the alternative 1-order linearly-evolved transformer variant with the 1-dimensional linear convolution chain to achieve the same function. In this way, our proposed method is capable of benefiting the cascaded modeling rule while achieving favorable performance in the efficient manner. Extensive experiments over multiple satellite datasets suggest that our proposed method achieves competitive performance against other state-of-the-art with fewer computational resources. Further, the consistently favorable performance has been verified over the hyper-spectral image fusion task. Our main focus is to provide an alternative global modeling framework with an efficient structure. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deepfake Video Detection using Convolutional Neural Network and CapsuleNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake technology, derived from deep learning, seamlessly inserts individuals into digital media, irrespective of their actual participation. Its foundation lies in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Initially, deepfakes served research, industry, and entertainment. While the concept has existed for decades, recent advancements render deepfakes nearly indistinguishable from reality. Accessibility has soared, empowering even novices to create convincing deepfakes. However, this accessibility raises security concerns.The primary deepfake creation algorithm, GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), employs machine learning to craft realistic images or videos. Our objective is to utilize CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and CapsuleNet with LSTM to differentiate between deepfake-generated frames and originals. Furthermore, we aim to elucidate our model's decision-making process through Explainable AI, fostering transparent human-AI relationships and offering practical examples for real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>3D Multi-frame Fusion for Video Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present RStab, a novel framework for video stabilization that integrates 3D multi-frame fusion through volume rendering. Departing from conventional methods, we introduce a 3D multi-frame perspective to generate stabilized images, addressing the challenge of full-frame generation while preserving structure. The core of our approach lies in Stabilized Rendering (SR), a volume rendering module, which extends beyond the image fusion by incorporating feature fusion. The core of our RStab framework lies in Stabilized Rendering (SR), a volume rendering module, fusing multi-frame information in 3D space. Specifically, SR involves warping features and colors from multiple frames by projection, fusing them into descriptors to render the stabilized image. However, the precision of warped information depends on the projection accuracy, a factor significantly influenced by dynamic regions. In response, we introduce the Adaptive Ray Range (ARR) module to integrate depth priors, adaptively defining the sampling range for the projection process. Additionally, we propose Color Correction (CC) assisting geometric constraints with optical flow for accurate color aggregation. Thanks to the three modules, our RStab demonstrates superior performance compared with previous stabilizers in the field of view (FOV), image quality, and video stability across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Robust CLIP-Based Detector for Exposing Diffusion Model-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized image generation, producing high-quality images with applications spanning various fields. However, their ability to create hyper-realistic images poses significant challenges in distinguishing between real and synthetic content, raising concerns about digital authenticity and potential misuse in creating deepfakes. This work introduces a robust detection framework that integrates image and text features extracted by CLIP model with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. We propose a novel loss that can improve the detector's robustness and handle imbalanced datasets. Additionally, we flatten the loss landscape during the model training to improve the detector's generalization capabilities. The effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional detection techniques, is demonstrated through extensive experiments, underscoring its potential to set a new state-of-the-art approach in DM-generated image detection. The code is available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/Robust_DM_Generated_Image_Detection.</description>

      <title>BANF: Band-limited Neural Fields for Levels of Detail Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Largely due to their implicit nature, neural fields lack a direct mechanism for filtering, as Fourier analysis from discrete signal processing is not directly applicable to these representations. Effective filtering of neural fields is critical to enable level-of-detail processing in downstream applications, and support operations that involve sampling the field on regular grids (e.g. marching cubes). Existing methods that attempt to decompose neural fields in the frequency domain either resort to heuristics or require extensive modifications to the neural field architecture. We show that via a simple modification, one can obtain neural fields that are low-pass filtered, and in turn show how this can be exploited to obtain a frequency decomposition of the entire signal. We demonstrate the validity of our technique by investigating level-of-detail reconstruction, and showing how coarser representations can be computed effectively.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion Models for Semantic 3D Brain MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18453v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, especially in medical imaging, faces challenges due to data scarcity and privacy concerns. Addressing these, we introduce Med-DDPM, a diffusion model designed for 3D semantic brain MRI synthesis. This model effectively tackles data scarcity and privacy issues by integrating semantic conditioning. This involves the channel-wise concatenation of a conditioning image to the model input, enabling control in image generation. Med-DDPM demonstrates superior stability and performance compared to existing 3D brain imaging synthesis methods. It generates diverse, anatomically coherent images with high visual fidelity. In terms of dice score accuracy in the tumor segmentation task, Med-DDPM achieves 0.6207, close to the 0.6531 accuracy of real images, and outperforms baseline models. Combined with real images, it further increases segmentation accuracy to 0.6675, showing the potential of our proposed method for data augmentation. This model represents the first use of a diffusion model in 3D semantic brain MRI synthesis, producing high-quality images. Its semantic conditioning feature also shows potential for image anonymization in biomedical imaging, addressing data and privacy issues. We provide the code and model weights for Med-DDPM on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/mobaidoctor/med-ddpm/) to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>DiffGEPCI: 3D MRI Synthesis from mGRE Signals using 2.5D Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework called DiffGEPCI for cross-modality generation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a 2.5D conditional diffusion model. DiffGEPCI can synthesize high-quality Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) and Magnetization Prepared-Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) images, without acquiring corresponding measurements, by leveraging multi-Gradient-Recalled Echo (mGRE) MRI signals as conditional inputs. DiffGEPCI operates in a two-step fashion: it initially estimates a 3D volume slice-by-slice using the axial plane and subsequently applies a refinement algorithm (referred to as 2.5D) to enhance the quality of the coronal and sagittal planes. Experimental validation on real mGRE data shows that DiffGEPCI achieves excellent performance, surpassing generative adversarial networks (GANs) and traditional diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Thoracic Diseases in Chest X-rays using hybrid CNN-Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical imaging has been used for diagnosis of various conditions, making it one of the most powerful resources for effective patient care. Due to widespread availability, low cost, and low radiation, chest X-ray is one of the most sought after radiology examination for the diagnosis of various thoracic diseases. Due to advancements in medical imaging technologies and increasing patient load, current radiology workflow faces various challenges including increasing backlogs, working long hours, and increase in diagnostic errors. An automated computer-aided diagnosis system that can interpret chest X-rays to augment radiologists by providing actionable insights has potential to provide second opinion to radiologists, highlight relevant regions in the image, in turn expediting clinical workflow, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving patient care. In this study, we applied a novel architecture augmenting the DenseNet121 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multi-head self-attention mechanism using transformer, namely SA-DenseNet121, that can identify multiple thoracic diseases in chest X-rays. We conducted experiments on four of the largest chest X-ray datasets, namely, ChestX-ray14, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, and IU-CXR. Experimental results in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) shows that augmenting CNN with self-attention has potential in diagnosing different thoracic diseases from chest X-rays. The proposed methodology has the potential to support the reading workflow, improve efficiency, and reduce diagnostic errors.</description>

      <title>One-shot skill assessment in high-stakes domains with limited data via meta learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00812v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has achieved robust competency assessment in various high-stakes fields. However, the applicability of DL models is often hampered by their substantial data requirements and confinement to specific training domains. This prevents them from transitioning to new tasks where data is scarce. Therefore, domain adaptation emerges as a critical element for the practical implementation of DL in real-world scenarios. Herein, we introduce A-VBANet, a novel meta-learning model capable of delivering domain-agnostic skill assessment via one-shot learning. Our methodology has been tested by assessing surgical skills on five laparoscopic and robotic simulators and real-life laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our model successfully adapted with accuracies up to 99.5% in one-shot and 99.9% in few-shot settings for simulated tasks and 89.7% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This study marks the first instance of a domain-agnostic methodology for skill assessment in critical fields setting a precedent for the broad application of DL across diverse real-life domains with limited data.</description>

      <title>A multi-modal approach for identifying schizophrenia using cross-modal attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on how different modalities of human communication can be used to distinguish between healthy controls and subjects with schizophrenia who exhibit strong positive symptoms. We developed a multi-modal schizophrenia classification system using audio, video, and text. Facial action units and vocal tract variables were extracted as low-level features from video and audio respectively, which were then used to compute high-level coordination features that served as the inputs to the audio and video modalities. Context-independent text embeddings extracted from transcriptions of speech were used as the input for the text modality. The multi-modal system is developed by fusing a segment-to-session-level classifier for video and audio modalities with a text model based on a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) with cross-modal attention. The proposed multi-modal system outperforms the previous state-of-the-art multi-modal system by 8.53% in the weighted average F1 score.</description>

      <title>Cross Domain Early Crop Mapping using CropSTGAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by abundant satellite imagery, machine learning-based approaches have recently been promoted to generate high-resolution crop cultivation maps to support many agricultural applications. One of the major challenges faced by these approaches is the limited availability of ground truth labels. In the absence of ground truth, existing work usually adopts the "direct transfer strategy" that trains a classifier using historical labels collected from other regions and then applies the trained model to the target region. Unfortunately, the spectral features of crops exhibit inter-region and inter-annual variability due to changes in soil composition, climate conditions, and crop progress, the resultant models perform poorly on new and unseen regions or years. Despite recent efforts, such as the application of the deep adaptation neural network (DANN) model structure in the deep adaptation crop classification network (DACCN), to tackle the above cross-domain challenges, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when there is a large dissimilarity between the source and target regions. This paper introduces the Crop Mapping Spectral-temporal Generative Adversarial Neural Network (CropSTGAN), a novel solution for cross-domain challenges, that doesn't require target domain labels. CropSTGAN learns to transform the target domain's spectral features to those of the source domain, effectively bridging large dissimilarities. Additionally, it employs an identity loss to maintain the intrinsic local structure of the data. Comprehensive experiments across various regions and years demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach. In experiments, CropSTGAN is benchmarked against various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Notably, CropSTGAN significantly outperforms these methods in scenarios with large data distribution dissimilarities between the target and source domains.</description>

      <title>List-Mode PET Image Reconstruction Using Dykstra-Like Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convergence of the block iterative method in image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET) requires careful control of relaxation parameters, which is a challenging task. The automatic determination of relaxation parameters for list-mode reconstructions also remains challenging. Therefore, a different approach would be desirable. In this study, we propose a list-mode maximum likelihood Dykstra-like splitting PET reconstruction (LM-MLDS). LM-MLDS converges the list-mode block iterative method by adding the distance from an initial image as a penalty term into an objective function. LM-MLDS takes a two-step approach because its performance depends on the quality of the initial image. The first step uses a uniform image as the initial image, and then the second step uses a reconstructed image after one main iteration as the initial image. In a simulation study, LM-MLDS provided a better tradeoff curve between noise and contrast than the other methods. In a clinical study, LM-MLDS removed the false hotspots at the edge of the axial field of view and improved the image quality of slices covering the top of the head to the cerebellum. List-mode proximal splitting reconstruction is useful not only for optimizing nondifferential functions but also for converging block iterative methods without controlling relaxation parameters.</description>
