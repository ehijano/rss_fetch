      <title>Systolic embedding of graphs on translation surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An embedding of a graph on a translation surface is said to be \emph{systolic} if each vertex of the graph corresponds to a singular point (or marked point) and each edge corresponds to a shortest saddle connection on the translation surface. The embedding is said to be \emph{cellular} (respectively \emph{essential}) if each complementary region is a topological disk (respectively not a topological disk). In this article, we prove that any finite graph admits an essential-systolic embedding on a translation surface and estimate the genera of such surfaces. For a wedge $\Sigma_n$ of $n$ circles, $n\geq2$, we investigate that $\Sigma_n$ admits cellular-systolic embedding on a translation surface and compute the minimum and maximum genera of such surfaces. Finally, we have identified another rich collection of graphs with more than one vertex that also admit cellular-sytolic embedding on translation surfaces.</description>

      <title>Minimal area of the spun trefoil knot on the canonical cubulation of $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a \emph{cubical 2-knot} $K^{2}$ is an embedding of the 2-sphere in the 2-skeleton of the canonical cubulation of $\mathbb{R}^4$; in particular, $K^{2}$ is the union of $m(K^{2})$ unit squares, hence $m(K^{2})$ is its area. We define the minimal area of $K^{2}$ as the minimum over all the areas of cubical 2-knots isotopic to the given knot type. The minimal area of a cubical 2-knot is an invariant, and the following natural question arose: Given a knot type, what area is needed for a cubical 2-knot in the canonical cubulation of $\mathbb{R}^4$ to realise that type with minimal area? In this paper, we answer this question for the spun trefoil knot in the weakly minimal case.</description>

      <title>Primitive stability and the Q-conditions for the rank two free group in hyperbolic d-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two largest known domains of discontinuity for the action of Out(F_2) on the PSL(2,C)-character variety of F_2 - defined by Minsky's primitive stability, and Bowditch's Q-conditions - were proven to be equal independently by Lee-Xu and Series. We prove the equivalence between primitive stability and a generalization of the Q-conditions for representations of F_2 into the isometry group of hyperbolic d-space for d &gt;= 3, under some assumptions. In particular, these assumptions are satisfied by all W_3-extensible representations.
  We also generalize Lee-Xu's and Series' results concerning the bounded intersection property to higher dimensions after extending their original definition to this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, the author described an associative algebra whose $A_\infty$-module categories encode the Heegaard Floer Dehn surgery formulas. In this article, we describe the Koszul dual of this algebra. We construct dualizing bimodules, and prove several equivalences of categories. The constructions of this paper have applications to computational problems involving the link surgery formula.</description>

      <title>Euclidean lengths and the Culler-Shalen norms of slopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of exceptional Dehn fillings, two functions on slopes, called the Euclidean length on a horotorus and the Culler-Shalen norm, play important roles. In this paper, we investigate their relationship and establish two inequalities between them. As a byproduct, some bounds on the boundary slope diameter are given.</description>

      <title>Gorenstein singularities with $\mathbb{G}_m$-action and moduli spaces of holomorphic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a holomorphic differential on a smooth curve, we associate to it a Gorenstein singularity with $\mathbb{G}_m$-action via a test configuration. This construction decomposes the strata of holomorphic differentials into negatively graded versal deformation spaces of such singularities, refining Pinkham's correspondence between monomial singularities and Weierstrass semigroups to the case of Gorenstein singularities with multiple branches in the framework of Looijenga's deformations with good $\mathbb{G}_m$-action. Additionally, this construction provides a natural description for the singular curves that appear in the boundary of the versal deformation spaces, generalizing various special cases from symmetric semigroups and local complete intersections to arbitrary Gorenstein curves that admit canonical divisors with prescribed orders of zeros. Our construction provides a uniform approach to describe the resulting singularities and their invariants, such as weights and characters, initially studied by Alper--Fedorchuk--Smyth. As an application, we classify the unique Gorenstein singularity with $\mathbb{G}_m$-action for each nonvarying stratum of holomorphic differentials in the work of Chen--M\"oller and Yu--Zuo, identify each nonvarying stratum with the locus of smooth deformations of the corresponding singularity, and study when these nonvarying strata can be compactified by weighted projective spaces. Additionally, we classify such singularities with bounded $\alpha$-invariants in the Hassett--Keel log minimal model program for $\overline{\mathcal M}_g$. We also study the slopes of these singularities and utilize them to bound the slopes of effective divisors in $\overline{\mathcal M}_g$. Finally, we show that the loci of subcanonical points with fixed semigroups have trivial tautological rings and provide a criterion to determine whether they are affine.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of real algebraic maps into curves with prescribed Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. %This can be contribut\ed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of the leaves of the singular foliation induced by a closed 1-form of Morse type on a compact orbifold. In particular, we establish criteria that characterize when all such leaves are compact, when they are non-compact, and how both types may coexist. As an application, we extend to the orbifold setting a celebrated result of Calabi, which provides a purely topological characterization of intrinsically closed harmonic 1-forms of Morse type.</description>

      <title>Veech Surfaces and Expanding Twist Tori on Moduli Spaces of Abelian Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,\omega)$ be a translation surface such that every leaf of its horizontal foliation is either closed, or joins two zeros of $\omega$. Then, $M$ decomposes as a union of horizontal Euclidean cylinders. The $\textit{twist torus}$ of $(M,\omega)$, denoted $\mathbb{T}(\omega)$, consists of all translation surfaces obtained from $(M,\omega)$ by applying the horocycle flow independently to each of these cylinders. Let $g_t$ be the Teichm\"uller geodesic flow. We study the distribution of the expanding tori $g_t\cdot \mathbb{T}(\omega)$ on moduli spaces of translation surfaces in cases where $(M,\omega)$ is a $\textit{Veech surface}$. We provide sufficient criteria for these tori to become dense within the conjectured limiting locus $\mathcal{M} :=\overline{\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})\cdot \mathbb{T}(\omega)}$ as $t\rightarrow \infty$. We also provide criteria guaranteeing a uniform lower bound on the mass a given open set $U\subset\mathcal{M}$ must receive with respect to any weak-$\ast$ limit of the uniform measures on $g_t\cdot \mathbb{T}(\omega)$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$. In particular, all such limits must be fully supported in $\mathcal{M}$ in such cases. Finally, we exhibit infinite families of well-known examples of Veech surfaces satisfying each of these results. A key feature of our results in comparison to previous work is that they do not require passage to subsequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper constructs hyperbolic polyhedral metrics via circle packings. We introduce the curvature of circles as a parameter to include all three types of constant curvature curves in the hyperbolic geometry. This provides a unified approach to producing polyhedral metrics for surfaces of broader topological types. The combinatorial total geodesic curvature serves as an effective tool for establishing the existence and uniqueness of the packing.</description>

      <title>The Dehn twist coefficient for big and small mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quasimorphism, which we call the Dehn twist coefficient (DTC), from the mapping class group of a surface (with a chosen compact boundary component) that generalizes the well-studied fractional Dehn twist coefficient (FDTC) to surfaces of infinite type. Indeed, for surfaces of finite type the DTC coincides with the FDTC. We provide a characterization of the DTC as the unique homogeneous quasimorphism satisfying certain positivity conditions. This characterization is new even for the classical finite-type case and requires minimal input beyond elementary topology.
  The FDTC has image contained in $\mathbb{Q}$. In contrast to this, we find that for some surfaces of infinite type the DTC has image all of $\mathbb{R}$. To see this we provide a new construction of maps with irrational rotation behavior for some surfaces of infinite type with a countable space of ends or even just one end. In fact, we find that the DTC is the right tool to detect irrational rotation behavior, even for surfaces without boundary.</description>

Abstract: We compute the twisted cohomology of the mapping class group with level structures, with coefficients in the $r$-tensor powers of the Prym representations for any positive integer $r$. When $r\ge 2$, we show that the cohomology exhibits instability for large genus, whereas it remains stable for $r=0$ or $r=1$. As a corollary, we prove that the symplectic Prym representation associated with any finite abelian regular cover of a non-closed finite-type surface is infinitesimally rigid.</description>

Abstract: We complete the characterization of the connected components of the space of type-preserving representations of a punctured surface group into $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We show that the connected components are indexed by the relative Euler classes and the signs of the images of the peripheral elements satisfying a generalized Milnor-Wood inequality; and when the surface is a punctured sphere, there are additional connected components consisting of ``totally non-hyperbolic" representations. As a consequence, we count the total number of the connected components of the space of type-preserving representations.</description>

Abstract: We study the real spectrum compactification of character varieties of finitely generated groups in semisimple Lie groups. This provides a compactification with good topological properties, and we interpret the boundary points in terms of actions on building-like spaces. Among the applications we give a general framework guaranteeing the existence of equivariant harmonic maps in building-like spaces.</description>

Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [15] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [15].</description>
