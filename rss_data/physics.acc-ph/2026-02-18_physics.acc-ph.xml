      <title>Basics of RF Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this educational text is selected examples of high-frequency electronic circuits and their components employed for the accurate phasing and synchronisation of accelerator cavities. Examples have been chosen to describe the basics of RF electronics. The starting point is transmission lines, connectors, discontinuities, and the handling of reflection. The application of simple surface mount components is discussed. The use of the Kuroda identities for converting lumped circuit designs to printed circuit designs is demonstrated. The accelerator example used to demonstrate the use of components is a circuit designed for the synchronisation of the CLIC crab cavities. This example employs co-planar waveguide, SMA connectors, Wilkinson splitters, and surface-mount double-balanced mixers. For the control of cavity phase and amplitude, the benefit of I&amp;Q controllers will be explained. The text will then discuss the operation and use of I&amp;Q modulators and VCOs.</description>

      <title>New Challenges in Plasma Accelerators: Final Focusing for Wakefield Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focusing of particle beams for collider experiments is crucial for maximizing the luminosity and thus the discovery potential of these machines. In recent years, plasma wakefield acceleration has emerged as a leading candidate for achieving higher energy collisions with smaller facility footprints due to the large accelerating gradients in the plasma. This higher beam energy poses significant challenges for the final focusing system of the collider. Here, we discuss the various challenges of final focusing for TeV-scale plasma accelerators and propose possible solutions. Finally, we present the first design of a final focusing system for a 10 TeV linear wakefield collider, evaluate its performance, and discuss its shortcomings as well as improvements for future designs.</description>

      <title>Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description>
