      <title>Existence theory for elliptic equations of general exponential nonlinearity on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semilinear elliptic equations on finite graphs with fully general exponential nonlinearities, thereby extending classical equations such as the Kazdan-Warner and Chern-Simons equations. A key contribution of this work is the development of new techniques for deriving a priori estimates in this generalized setting, which reduce the original finite graph to a graph with only two vertices. This reduction enables us to explicitly compute the Brouwer degree and to establish the existence of solutions when the degree is nonzero. Furthermore, using the method of sub- and supersolutions, we also prove the existence of solutions in cases where the Brouwer degree vanishes.</description>

      <title>On quantitative linear gravitational relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove quantitative decay rates for the linearised Vlasov-Poisson system around compactly supported equilibria. More precisely, we prove decay of the gravitational potential induced by the radial dynamics of this system in the presence of a point mass source. Our result can be interpreted as the gravitational version of linear Landau damping in the radial setting and hence the first linear asymptotic stability result around such equilibria. We face fundamental obstacles to decay caused by the presence of stable trapping in the problem. To overcome these issues we introduce several new ideas. We use different tools, including the Birkhoff-Poincar\'e normal form, action-angle type variables, and delicate resolvent bounds to prove a suitable version of the limiting absorption principle and obtain the decay-in-time.</description>

      <title>Essentials of Real Analysis and Morrey-Sobolev spaces for second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs with singular first-order coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years we witness growing interest in using Real Analysis methods and results in the theory of nondivergence form partial differential equations (PDEs) and the goal of this article is to give a brief and concise introduction into the applications of several results in Real Analysis to the theory of elliptic and parabolic equations in Sobolev and Morrey-Sobolev spaces. In particular, we concentrate on such results as Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem, Fefferman-Stein theorem, theory of Muckenhoupt weights, and Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem and their role in Sobolev or Morrey-Sobolev space theory of parabolic equations with mixed norms.
  In our exposition we do not try to give the strongest known results for particular equations in particular spaces. We only show how the Real Analysis results, we present with all proofs, can be used in model cases such as the Laplace and the heat equations with singular first order terms. The only exception is the last section where we present relatively new results.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Second Order Schr\"odinger Wave Equations Near Static Black Holes and Strong Singularities of the Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a linear Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ with a strongly singular potential $V$ not bounded from below on a non-compact incomplete Riemannian manifold $M$. We assume that the negative part of potential $V_{-}$ is measurable, and it does not necessarily belong to either local Kato or Stummel classes, and we define new geometric conditions on the growth of $V_{-}$ in a special $\textit{range control neighborhood (RCN)}$ such that $H$ is semibounded from below on functions compactly supported in these neighborhoods. We define RCN by means of $\textit{an inner time metric}$ which estimates the minimal time for a classical particle to travel between any two points on $M$, and we assume that $M$ is complete w.r.t. this metric, i.e. the potential $V$ is classically complete on $M$. For the corresponding Cauchy problem of the wave equation $u_{tt} + Hu = 0$, we define locally a Lorentzian metric such that its light cone is formed along the minimizing curves with respect to the inner time metric, where both an energy inequality and uniqueness of solutions hold. Inversely, for well-known Lorentzian metrics of static black holes - Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and de Sitter metrics - we study the wave equations for the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators, and we show that the event horizons of these black holes belong to the RCNs of infinity w.r.t. the inner time metrics, and that all solutions of the mixed problems stay in these neighborhoods indefinitely long.</description>

      <title>Periodic operators over a component domain and homogenization of some class of quasi-linear elliptic problems in two-component domain with interfacial resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the periodic homogenization of quasilinear elliptic PDEs in a two-component domain with an interfacial thermal barrier. It introduces a periodic extension operator that ensures strong convergence of function sequences in the Sobolev space. Moreover, two families of quasilinear elliptic problems in two-component domains with interfacial resistance will be considered here. One family with \(L^2\) data and another family with \(L^1\) data.</description>

      <title>Sharp H\"older regularity of weak solutions of the Neumann problem and applications to nonlocal PDE in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global H\"older regularity result for weak solutions $u\in N^{1,p}(\Omega, \mu)$ to a PDE of $p$-Laplacian type with a measure as non-homogeneous term: \[ -\text{div}\!\left( |\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u \right)=\overline\nu, \] 
where $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $\overline\nu \in (N^{1,p}(\Omega,\mu))^*$ is a signed Radon measure supported in $\overline \Omega$. Here, $\Omega$ is a John domain in a metric measure space satisfying a doubling condition and a $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, and $\nabla u$ is the Cheeger gradient. The regularity results obtained in this paper improve on earlier estimates proved by the authors in \cite{CGKS} for the study of the Neumann problem, and have applications to the regularity of solutions of nonlocal PDE in doubling metric spaces. Moreover, the obtained H\"older exponent matches with the known sharp result in the Euclidean case \cite{CSt,BLS,BT}.</description>

      <title>On the optimal Sobolev threshold for evolution equations with rough nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we are concerned with evolution equations of the form \begin{equation*} \partial_tu-A(D)u=F(u,\overline{u},\nabla u, \nabla \overline{u}) \end{equation*} where $A(D)$ is a Fourier multiplier of either dispersive or parabolic type and the nonlinear term $F$ is of limited regularity. Our objective is to develop a robust set of principles which can be used in many cases to predict the \emph{highest} Sobolev exponent $s=s(q,d)$ for which the above evolution is well-posed in $W_x^{s,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ (necessarily restricting to $q=2$ for dispersive problems). We will confirm the validity of these principles for two of the most important model problems; namely, the nonlinear Schr\"odinger and heat equations. More precisely, we will prove that the nonlinear heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_tu-\Delta u=\pm |u|^{p-1}u, \hspace{5mm} p&gt;1, \end{equation*} is well-posed in $W_x^{s,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ when $\max\{0,s_c\}&lt;s&lt;2+p+\frac{1}{q}$ and is \emph{strongly ill-posed} when $s\geq \max\{s_c,2+p+\frac{1}{q}\}$ and $p-1\not\in 2\mathbb{N}$ in the sense of non-existence of solutions even for smooth, small and compactly supported data. When $q=2$, we establish the same ill-posedness result for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the corresponding well-posedness result when $p\geq \frac{3}{2}$. Identifying the optimal Sobolev threshold for even a single non-algebraic $p&gt;1$ was a rather longstanding open problem in the literature. As an immediate corollary of the fact that our ill-posedness threshold is dimension independent, we may conclude by taking $d\gg p$ that there are nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations which are ill-posed in \emph{every} Sobolev space $H_x^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Stability of Riemann Shocks for isothermal Euler by Inviscid limits of global-in-time large Navier-Stokes flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the isothermal gas dynamics. We first establish the global existence of strong solutions to the one-dimensional isothermal Navier-Stokes system for smooth initial data without any smallness conditions, assuming that the initial density has strictly positive lower bound. The existence result allows for possibly degenerate viscosity coefficients and admits different asymptotic states at the far fields. We then prove a contraction property for the strong solutions perturbed from viscous shocks, yielding uniform estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficients. This covers any large perturbations, and consequently, we establish the inviscid limits and their stability estimate. In other words, we demonstrate the stability of Riemann shocks to the one-dimensional isothermal Euler system in the class of vanishing viscosity limits of the associated Navier-Stokes system.</description>

      <title>The Robin heat kernel and its expansion via Robin eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of the Robin heat kernel on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary for Robin parameter $\a\in \R$, expressed as a spectral expansion in terms of Robin eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. For $\a&gt;0$, the proof relies on trace Sobolev inequalities and eigenfunction estimates, while the $\a&lt;0$ case requires new techniques to deal with $L^\infty$ estimates of Robin eigenfunctions. Our results unify the classical Dirichlet and Neumann cases while extending to the less-studied negative parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations on noncompact metric graphs with localized nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following nonlinear Dirac equations (NLDE) on noncompact metric graph $\mathcal{G}$ with localized nonlinearities \begin{equation} \mathcal{D} u - \omega u= a\chi_{\mathcal{K}}|u|^{p-2}u, \end{equation} where $\mathcal{D}$ is the Dirac operator on $\mathcal{G}$, $u: \mathcal{G} \to \mathbb{C}^2$, $\omega\in \mathbb{R}$, $a &gt; 0$, $\chi_{\mathcal{K}}$ is the characteristic function of the compact core $\mathcal{K}$, and $p&gt;2$. First, for $2&lt;p&lt;4$, we prove the existence of normalized solutions to (NLDE) using a perturbation argument. Then, for $p \geq 4$, we establish the assumption under which normalized solutions to (NLDE) exist. Finally, we extend these results to the case $a&lt;0$ and, for all $p&gt;2$, prove the existence of normalized solutions to (NLDE) when $\lambda = -mc^2$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{D}$. In the Appendix, we study the influence of the parameters $m, c &gt; 0$ on the existence of normalized solutions to (NLDE). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the normalized solutions to (NLDE) on metric graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the interior and global Lipschitz regularity results for a solution of fully nonlinear equations with $(p,q)$-growth. We prove that for a small gap $q-p$, a solution is locally or globally Lipschitz continuous. We also prove that a given H\"older continuous solution is Lipschitz continuous under improved bounds for the gap. These gap conditions are similar to those required for the regularity of double phase problems in divergence form.</description>

      <title>Damping Effects on Global Existence and Scattering for an Inhomogeneous NLS Equation with Inverse-Square Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the global existence and scattering behavior of solutions to a damped, inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrodinger equation featuring a time-dependent damping term, an inverse-square potential, and an inhomogeneous nonlinearity. We establish global well-posedness in the energy space for subcritical, mass-critical, and energy-critical regimes, using Strichartz estimates, Hardy inequalities, and Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type estimates. For sufficiently large damping, we highlight how the interplay between damping, singular potentials, and inhomogeneity influences the dynamics. Our results extend existing studies and offer new insights into the long-time behavior of solutions in this more general setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the combined effects of inverse-square potential, inhomogeneous (or even homogeneous) nonlinearity, and damping in the context of the NLS equation.</description>

      <title>Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem under Magnetic Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study both the Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem when a family of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps are given for an open set of magnetic/electromagnetic potentials. For the Riemannian version, by allowing small perturbations of the magnetic potential, we use the Runge Approximation Theorem to show that the metric can be uniquely determined. There is no gauge equivalence in this case. For the Lorentzian version, we use microlocal analysis to construct the trajectory of null-geodesics via generic perturbations of the electromagnetic potential, hence the conformal class of the metric can be constructed. Moreover, we also show, in the Lorentzian case, the same result can be obtained using generic perturbations of the metric itself.</description>

      <title>A minimum problem associated with scalar Ginzburg-Landau equation and free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N&gt;2$, $p\in \left(\frac{2N}{N+2},+\infty\right)$, and $\Omega$ be an open bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$. We consider the minimum problem
  $$
  \mathcal{J} (u) := \displaystyle\int_{\Omega } \left(\frac{1}{p}| \nabla u| ^p+\lambda_1\left(1-(u^+)^2\right)^2+\lambda_2u^+\right)\text{d}x\rightarrow \text{min}
  $$
  over a certain class $\mathcal{K}$, where $\lambda_1\geq 0$ and $ \lambda_2\in \mathbb{R}$ are constants, and $u^+:=\max\{u,0\}$.
  The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation is related to the Ginzburg-Landau equation and involves a subcritical exponent when $\lambda_1&gt;0$.
  For $\lambda_1\geq 0$ and $ \lambda_2\in \mathbb{R}$, we prove the existence, non-negativity, and uniform boundedness of minimizers of $\mathcal{J} (u) $. Then, we show that any minimizer is locally $C^{1,\alpha}$-continuous with some $\alpha\in (0,1)$ and admits the optimal growth $\frac{p}{p-1}$ near the free boundary. Finally, under the additional assumption that $\lambda_2&gt;0$, we establish non-degeneracy for minimizers near the free boundary and show that there exists at least one minimizer for which the corresponding free boundary has finite ($N-1$)-dimensional Hausdorff measure.</description>

      <title>[Dispersion for the wave equation in the exterior of the torus]{Dispersion for the wave equation in the exterior of the torus in three dimensions}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove dispersive estimates for the wave equation in the exterior of a torus. Because no separation of variables into a basis of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues exists for the time harmonic problem, we introduce a related approximate operator for the Dirichlet Laplacian in the exterior of a torus. The approximate operator coincides with the Schr\"odinger operator with a P\"oschl-Teller potential and agrees with the Dirichlet Laplacian to leading order. The operator here which we develop is related to the so-called Mehler-Fock kernel. Using the known solution to the eigenvector and eigenvalue problem of P\"oschl-Teller, a high-frequency analysis of the approximate operator for the wave equation can be made accurately. The operator for this problem gives a close approximation to the $L^1\rightarrow L^{\infty}$ dispersive estimate at a suitable small distance from the torus for the corresponding exterior wave operator with Dirichlet Laplacian.</description>

Abstract: Community detection is an important problem in graph neural networks. Recently, algorithms based on Ricci curvature flows have gained significant attention. It was suggested by Ollivier (2009), and applied to community detection by Ni et al (2019) and Lai et al (2022). Its mathematical theory was due to Bai et al (2024) and Li-M\"unch (2025). In particular, solutions to some of these flows have existence, uniqueness and convergence. However, a unified theoretical framework has not yet been established in this field.
  In the current study, we propose several unified piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flows with respect to arbitrarily selected Ricci curvatures. First, we prove that the flows have global existence and uniqueness. Second, we show that if the Ricci curvature being used is homogeneous, then after undergoing multiple surgeries, the evolving graph has a constant Ricci curvature on each connected component. Note that five commonly used Ricci curvatures, which were respectively defined by Ollivier, Lin-Lu-Yau, Forman, Menger and Haantjes, are all homogeneous, and that the proof of all these results is independent of the choice of the specific Ricci curvature. Third, as an application, we apply the discrete piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flow with surgeries to the problem of community detection. On three real-world datasets, the flow consistently outperforms baseline models and existing methods. Complementary experiments on synthetic graphs further confirm its scalability and robustness. Compared with existing algorithms, our algorithm has two advantages: it does not require curvature calculations at each iteration, and the iterative process converges.</description>

      <title>Equilibration and convected limit in 2D-1D corotational Oldroyd's fluid-structure interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a solute-solvent-structure mutually coupled system of equations given by an Oldroyd-type model for a two-dimensional dilute corotational polymer fluid with solute diffusion and damping that is interacting with a one-dimensional viscoelastic shell. Firstly, we give the rate at which its solution decays exponentially in time to the equilibrium solution, independent of the choice of the initial datum. Secondly, as the polymer relaxation time goes to infinity (or, equivalently, the center-of mass diffusion goes to zero), we show that any family of strong solutions of the system described above, that is parametrized by the relaxation time, converges to an essentially bounded weak solution of a corotational polymer fluid-structure interaction system whose solute evolves according to the convected time derivative of its extra stress tensor. A consequence of this is a weak-strong uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Hybridization theory for plasmon resonance in metallic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the hybridization theory of plasmon resonance in metallic nanostructures, which has been validated by the authors in [31] through a series of experiments. In an electrostatic field, we establish a mathematical framework for the Neumann-Poincar\'{e}(NP) type operators for metallic nanoparticles with general geometries related to core and shell scales. We calculate the plasmon resonance frequency of concentric disk metal nanoshells with normal perturbations at the interfaces by the asymptotic analysis and perturbation theory to reveal the intrinsic hybridization between solid and cavity plasmon modes. The theoretical finding are convincingly supported by extensive numerical experiments. Our theory corroborates and strengthens that by properly enriching the materials structures as well as the underlying geometries, one can induce much richer plasmon resonance phenomena of practical significance.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of 2D incompressible MHD equations without magnetic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the global existence of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem for 2D incompressible viscous MHD equations without magnetic diffusion has been proved in \cite{Ren,TZhang}, under the assumption that initial data is close to equilibrium states with nontrivial magnetic field, and the perturbation is small in some suitable spaces, say for instance, the Sobolev spaces with negative exponents. It leads to an interesting open question: Can one establish the global existence of classical solutions without the extra help from Sobolev spaces with negative exponents like its counterparts of ideal MHD ( i.e. without viscosity and magnetic diffusion), and fully dissipative MHD (i.e. with both viscosity and magnetic diffusion)? This paper offers an affirmative answer to this question. In fact, we will establish the existence of a global unique solution for initial perturbations being small in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The key idea is further exploring the structure of system, using dispersive effects of Alfv\'{e}n waves in the direction which is transversal to the dissipation favorable direction. This motivates our key strategy to treat the wildest nonlinear terms as an artificial linear term. These observations help us to construct some interesting quantities which improves the nonlinearity order for the wildest terms, and to control them by terms with better properties.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium price of bubble assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a simple economy, we derive a new Hamilton-Jacobi equation which is satisfied by the value of a ''bubble'' asset. We then show, by providing a rigorous mathematical analysis of this equation, that a unique non-zero stable solution exists under certain assumptions. The economic interpretation of this result is that, if the bubble asset can produce more stable returns than fiat money, agents protect themselves from hazardous situations through the bubble asset, thus forming a bubble's consensus value. Our mathematical analysis uses different ideas coming from the study of semi-linear elliptic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a $C^{1,1}$-regularity of minimizers of the functional $$ \int_I \sqrt{1+|Du|^2} + \int_I |u-g|ds,\quad u\in BV(I), $$ provided $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded open interval and $\|g\|_\infty$ is sufficiently small, thus partially establishing a De Giorgi conjecture in dimension one and codimension one. We also extend our result to a suitable anisotropic setting.</description>

      <title>Energy Conservation and Vanishing Viscosity Limit for the Primitive Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of energy conservation for weak solutions of the inviscid Primitive Equations (PE) in a bounded domain. Based on the work [Bardos et al., Onsager's conjecture with physical boundaries and an application to the vanishing viscosity limit, Comm. Math. Phys., 2019, 291-310], we prove the energy conservation for PE with boundary condition under suitable Onsager-type assumptions. But due to the special structure of PE system and its domain, some new challenging difficulties arise: the lack of information about the vertical velocity, and existing corner points in the domain. We introduce some new ideas to overcome the above obstacles. As a byproduct, we give a sufficient condition for absence of anomalous energy dissipation in the vanishing viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>On an Euler-Schr\"{o}dinger system appearing in laser-plasma interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the barotropic Euler system coupled to a vector Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the whole space. Assuming that the initial density and vector potential are small enough, and that the initial velocity is close to some reference vector field $u_0$ such that the spectrum of $Du_0$ is bounded away from zero, we prove the existence of a global-in-time unique solution with (fractional) Sobolev regularity. Moreover, we obtain some algebraic time decay estimates of the solution. Our work extends the papers by D. Serre and M. Grassin [11, 13, 19] and previous works by B. Ducomet and co-authors [4, 8] dedicated to the compressible Euler-Poisson system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review examines classical and recent results on controllability and inverse problems for hyperbolic and dispersive equations with dynamic boundary conditions. We aim to illustrate the applicability of Carleman estimates to establish exact controllability of such equations and derive Lipschitz stability estimates for inverse problems of source terms and coefficients with general dynamic boundary conditions. We highlight the challenges associated with dynamic boundary conditions compared to classical static ones. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>On Kenig's Class $AE$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we explore Kenig's class $AE$ of analytic extensions. It was introduced in his PhD Thesis. Later, a Smirnov-type condition was added by Jerison and Kenig. We re-examine this class and prove that, with this addition, the $H^1$-condition in the original definition becomes unnecessary. In order to accomplish this, we establish an equivalence between a stronger $H^1$-integrability condition and the Smirnov-type condition. To do so, we state in closed form some ideas of an article of Hunt, Muckenhoupt and Wheeden.
  As a consequence, we generalize in a direct manner some results of Carro, Naibo and Ortiz-Caraballo needed to study the Neumann problem with $A_{\infty}$-measures on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Theory for Second Order Elliptic Operators with BMO Antisymmetric Part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we study perturbation theory for the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem on bounded chord arc domains for elliptic operators in divergence form with potentially unbounded antisymmetric part in BMO. Specifically, given elliptic operators $L_0 = \mbox{div}(A_0\nabla)$ and $L_1 = \mbox{div}(A_1\nabla)$ such that the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for $L_0$ is solvable for some $p&gt;1$; we show that if $A_0 - A_1$ satisfies certain Carleson condition, then the $ L^q$ Dirichlet problem for $L_1$ is solvable for some $q \geq p$. Moreover if the Carleson norm is small then we may take $q=p$. We use the approach first introduced in Fefferman-Kenig-Pipher '91 on the unit ball, and build on Milakis-Pipher-Toro '11 where the large norm case was shown for symmetric matrices on bounded chord arc domains. We then apply this to solve the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem on a bounded Lipschitz domain for an operator $L = \mbox{div}(A\nabla)$, where $A$ satisfies a Carleson condition similar to the one assumed in Kenig-Pipher '01 and Dindo\v{s}-Petermichl-Pipher '07 but with unbounded antisymmetric part.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a normalized, stationary solution $\Psi \colon \mathbb{R}^{3} \to \mathbb{C}^{4}$ with frequency $w &gt; 0$ of the nonlinear Dirac equation. The result covers the case in which the nonlinearity is the gradient of a function of the form \begin{equation*} F(\Psi) = a|(\Psi, \gamma^{0}\Psi)|^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} + b|(\Psi, \gamma^{1}\gamma^{2} \gamma^{3} \Psi)|^{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \end{equation*} with $\alpha \in (2,\frac{8}{3}]$, $b \geq 0$ and $a &gt; 0$ sufficiently small. Here $\gamma^{i}$, $i = 0,\ldots, 3$ are the $4 \times 4$ Dirac's matrices.
  We find the solution as a critical point of a suitable functional restricted to the unit sphere in $L^{2}$, and $w$ turns out to be the corresponding Lagrange multiplier.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on three main objectives related to Hardy-type inequalities on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. Firstly, we explore critical Hardy-type inequalities that contain logarithmic terms, highlighting their significance. Secondly, we examine the stability of both critical and subcritical cases of the Hardy inequality. Lastly, we establish two weighted Hardy-type inequalities where singularities appear at the origin as well as boundary and we discuss their implications for higher-order operators. Our results improve upon previous findings and also present new higher-order versions of these inequalities as additional outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The free elastic flow is the $L^2$-gradient flow for Euler's elastic energy, or equivalently the Willmore flow with translation invariant initial data. In contrast to elastic flows under length penalisation or preservation, it is more challenging to study the free elastic flow's asymptotic behavior, and convergence for closed curves is lost. In this paper, we nevertheless determine the asymptotic shape of the flow for initial curves that are geometrically close to circles, possibly multiply-covered, proving that an appropriate rescaling smoothly converges to a unique round circle.</description>

      <title>Fine Boundary Regularity For The Fractional (p,q)-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we deal with the fine boundary regularity, a weighted H\"{o}lder regularity of weak solutions to the problem involving the fractional $(p,q)$ Laplacian denoted by $(-\Delta)_{p}^{s} u + (-\Delta)_{q}^{s} u = f(x)$ in $\Omega,$ and $u=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega;$ where $\Omega$ is a $C^{1,1}$ bounded domain and $2 \leq p \leq q &lt;\infty.$ For $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and for non-negative data $f\in L^{\infty}(\Omega),$ we employ the nonlocal analogue of the boundary Harnack method to establish that $u/{d_{\Omega}^{s}} \in C^{\alpha}(\Bar{\Omega})$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1),$ where $d_\Omega(x)$ is the distance of $x$ from the boundary. A novel barrier construction allows us to analyse the regularity theory even in the absence of the scaling or the homogeneity properties of the operator. Additionally, we extend our idea to sign changing bounded $f$ as well and prove a fine boundary regularity for fractional $(p,q)$ Laplacian for some range of $s.$</description>

      <title>A relation between the Dirichlet and the Regularity problem for Parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the Dirichlet and Regularity problem for parabolic operators of the form $ L = \mbox{div}(A\nabla\cdot) - \partial_t $ on cylindrical domains $ \Omega = \mathcal O \times \mathbb R $, where the base $ \mathcal O \subset \mathbb R^{n} $ is a $1$-sided chord arc domain (and for one result Lipschitz) in the spatial variables.
  In the paper we answer the question when the solvability of the $L^p$ Regularity problem for $L$ (denoted by $ (R_L)_{p} $) can be deduced from the solvability of the $ L^{p'} $ Dirichlet problem for the adjoint operator $L^*$ (denoted $ (D_L^*)_{p'} $).
  We show that this holds if for at least of $q\in(1,\infty)$ the problem $ (R_L)_{q} $ is solvable. That is, we establish a duality/dichotomy result: Dirichlet solvability implies Regularity solvability in the dual $L^p$ range, or the Regularity problem is not solvable in any $L^p$.
  Results like these were only known in the elliptic settings (Kenig-Pipher (1993) and Shen (2006)) but are new for parabolic PDEs. Our result is one of the key components needed for the recent advancement of Dindo\v{s}, Li and Pipher in understanding solvability of the Regularity problem for operators whose coefficients satisfy certain natural Carleson condition (called also DKP-condition in the elliptic case).</description>

      <title>Existence of weak martingale solutions to a stochastic fluid-structure interaction problem with a compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of weak martingale solutions to a stochastic moving boundary problem arising from the interaction between an isentropic compressible fluid and a viscoelastic structure. In the model, we consider a three-dimensional compressible isentropic fluid with adiabatic constant $\gamma &gt; 3/2$ interacting dynamically with an elastic structure on the boundary of the fluid domain described by a plate equation, under the additional influence of stochastic perturbations which randomly force both the compressible fluid and elastic structure equations in time. The problem is nonlinearly coupled in the sense that the a priori unknown (and random) displacement of the elastic structure from its reference configuration determines the a priori unknown (and random) time-dependent fluid domain on which the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations are posed. We use a splitting method, consisting of a fluid and structure subproblem, to construct random approximate solutions to an approximate Galerkin form of the problem with artificial viscosity and artificial pressure. We introduce stopped processes of structure displacements which handle the issues associated with potential fluid domain degeneracy. In this splitting scheme, we handle mathematical difficulties associated with the a priori unknown and time-dependent fluid domain by using an extension of the fluid equations to a fixed maximal domain and we handle difficulties associated with imposing the no-slip condition in the stochastic setting by using a novel penalty term defined on an external tubular neighborhood of the moving fluid-structure interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-posedness result for stochastic fluid-structure interaction with compressible fluids.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear scalar field equation with point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear scalar field equation with a point interaction at the origin in dimensions two and three. By applying the mountain pass theorem and the technique of adding one dimensional space, we prove the existence of a nontrivial singular solution for a wide class of nonlinearities. We also establish the Pohozaev identity by proving a pointwise estimate of the gradient near the origin. Some qualitative properties of nontrivial solutions are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass-conserving reaction-diffusion systems with bistable nonlinearity are considered under general assumptions. The existence of stationary solutions with a single internal transition layer in such reaction-diffusion systems is shown using the analytical singular perturbation theory. Moreover, a stability criterion for the stationary solutions is provided by calculating the Evans function.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity Results for Mixed Local Nonlocal Equations With Indefinite Concave-Convex Type Nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we examine the multiplicity of non-negative solutions to mixed local-nonlocal equations involving \((-\Delta_p) + (-\Delta^{s}_{q})\) in a bounded smooth domain. The nonlinearity incorporates a parameter \(\lambda &gt; 0\), a sublinear term, and a superlinear term, with sign-changing weight functions \(a(x)\) and \(b(x)\). Under suitable conditions, we establish the existence of at least two distinct nontrivial non-negative solutions in both the subcritical and critical regimes via fibering map analysis and constrained minimization on the Nehari manifold. Additionally, for \(p \not = q\), we obtain a nonexistence result for large \(\lambda\) by analyzing the associated generalized eigenvalue problem.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two-dimensional water waves with constant vorticity, under the action of gravity and surface tension, in a fluid domain with finite depth and general bottom topography. We present a formulation which generalizes the one by Zakharov-Craig-Sulem for irrotational water waves, and the one by Constantin-Ivanov-Prodanov for water waves with constant vorticity and flat bottom topography. We study in detail an operator which appears in such formulation, extending well-known results for the classical Dirichlet-Neumann operator, such as an analiticity result, the Taylor expansion in homogeneous powers of the wave profile, and a paralinearization formula. As an application, we prove a local well-posedness result.</description>

Abstract: We provide an upper estimate for the eigenvalues of the curl curl operator on a bounded, three-dimensional Euclidean domain in terms of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian. The result complements recent inequalities between curl curl and Neumann Laplacian eigenvalues. The curl curl eigenvalues considered here correspond to the Maxwell eigenvalue problem with constant material parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00891v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction in Lipschitz domains, via probabilistic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete and continuous version of the spectral Dirichlet problem in an open bounded connected set $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed upon exiting the (large) bounded domain $\Omega_N = (N\Omega)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We let $P_N$ its transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$, also known as ground state. Under mild assumptions on $\Omega$, we give regularity estimates on $\phi_N$, namely on its $k$-th order differences, with a uniform control inside $\Omega_N$. We provide a completely probabilistic proof of these estimates: our starting point is a Feynman--Kac representation of $\phi_N$, combined with gambler's ruin estimates and a new ``multi-mirror'' coupling, which may be of independent interest. We also obtain the same type of estimates for the first eigenfunction $\varphi_1$ of the corresponding continuous spectral Dirichlet problem, in relation with a Brownian motion killed upon exiting $\Omega$. Finally, we take the opportunity to review (and slightly extend) some of the literature on the $L^2$ and uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to $\varphi_1$ in Lipschitz bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be derived thanks to our estimates.</description>

      <title>Machine learning on manifolds for inverse scattering: Lipschitz stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing Lipschitz stability estimates is crucial for ensuring the mathematical robustness of neural network (NN) approximations in machine learning (ML)-based parameter estimation, particularly in physics-informed settings. In this work, we derive such estimates for the inverse of a nonlinear map defined on a manifold that captures both unknown parameters and the nonlinear physical processes they influence. Our analysis is based on finite-dimensional, learnable representations of the manifold and provides Lipschitz stability estimates on the manifold-based subspaces, for a class of inverse maps associated with parameter dependent linear compact operators. Such operators model scattered and far-field data that can be used to detect structures such as cracks. We apply our theoretical ML manifold framework to inverse Helmholtz problems in unbounded regions exterior to cracks, addressing the scattered-field data-driven inverse problem while ensuring injectivity conditions on the manifold, a requirement for the Lipschitz stability. Our method accurately recovers crack-defining parameters without requiring prior knowledge of inputs such as incident wave types or external forces on the crack. Numerical experiments using NN approximations confirm the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Strong well-posedness of the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation on moving domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the strong($H^1$) well-posedness of the two dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with multiplicative noise on moving domains. Due to the nonlocality effect, this equation exhibits a ``piecewise" variational setting. Namely the global well-posedness of this equation is decomposed into the well-posedness of a family of stochastic partial differential equations(SPDEs) in the variational setting on each small time-interval. We first examine the well-posedness on each time interval, which does not have (nonhomogeneous) coercivity. Subsequently, we give an estimate of lower bound of length of the time-interval, which enables us to achieve the global well-posedness.</description>
