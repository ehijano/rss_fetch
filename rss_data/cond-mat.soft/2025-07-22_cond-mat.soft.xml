      <title>Integral fractional viscoelastic models in SPH: LAOS simulations versus experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheological behaviour of a polymer was investigated by performing numerical simulations in complex flow and comparing them to experiments. For our simulations, we employed a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics scheme, utilizing an integral fractional model based on the K-BKZ framework. The results are compared with experiments performed on melt-state isotactic polypropylene under medium and large amplitude oscillatory shear.
  The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the model is able to capture and predict both the linear and the non-linear viscoelastic behaviours of the polymer melt. Results show that equipping SPH with an integral fractional model is promising approach for the simulation of complex polymeric materials under realistic conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of active matter models in which we keep track of fuel (stored energy) consumption. They are by construction, thermodynamically consistent. Using these models it is possible for us to observe and follow how active behaviour develops and also how it dissipates as the energy runs out. It is also straightforward to define, calculate and keep track of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities.</description>

      <title>Surface Charge Relaxation Controls the Lifetime of Out-of-Equilibrium Colloidal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between charged colloidal particles are profoundly influenced by charge regulation and charge renormalization, rendering the effective potential highly sensitive to local particle density. In this work, we investigate how a dynamically evolving, density-dependent Yukawa interaction affects the stability of out-of-equilibrium colloidal structures. Motivated by a series of experiments where unexpectedly long-lived colloidal crystals have suggested the presence of like-charged attractions, we systematically explore the role of charge regulation and charge renormalization. Using Poisson-Boltzmann cell theory, we compute the effective colloidal charge and screening length as a function of packing fraction. These results are subsequently incorporated into Brownian dynamics simulations that dynamically resolve the evolving colloid charge as a function of time and local density. In the case of slow relaxation dynamics, our results show that incorporating these charging effects significantly prolongs the lifetimes of out-of-equilibrium colloidal crystals, providing an explanation for the experimental observation of long-lived crystals. These findings demonstrate that the interplay of surface charge dynamics and colloidal interactions can give rise to complex and rich nonequilibrium behavior in charged colloidal suspensions, opening new pathways for tuning colloidal stability through electrostatic feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The physical consequences of sperm gigantism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The male fruit fly produces ~1.8 mm long sperm, thousands of which can be stored until mating in a ~200 micron sac, the seminal vesicle. While the evolutionary pressures driving such extreme sperm (flagellar) lengths have long been investigated, the physical consequences of their gigantism are unstudied. Through high-resolution three-dimensional reconstructions of in vivo sperm morphologies and rapid live imaging, we discovered that stored sperm are organized into a dense and highly aligned state. The packed flagella exhibit system-wide collective 'material' flows, with persistent and slow-moving topological defects; individual sperm, despite their extraordinary lengths, propagate rapidly through the flagellar material, moving in either direction along material director lines. To understand how these collective behaviors arise from the constituents' nonequilibrium dynamics, we conceptualize the motion of individual sperm as topologically confined to a reptation-like tube formed by its neighbors. Therein, sperm propagate through observed amplitude-constrained and internally driven flagellar bending waves, pushing off counter-propagating neighbors. From this conception, we derive a continuum theory that produces an extensile material stress that can sustain an aligned flagellar material. Experimental perturbations and simulations of active elastic filaments verify our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that active stresses in the flagellar material maintain the sperm in an unentangled, hence functional state, in both sexes, and establish giant sperm in their native habitat as a novel and physiologically relevant active matter system.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic pressure as a convenient mechanical framework for dry active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of local pressure in active matter systems remains a subject of considerable debate. Through theoretical calculations and extensive simulations of various active systems, we demonstrate that intrinsic pressure (defined in the same way as in passive systems) is an ideal candidate for local pressure of dry active matter, while the self-propelling forces on the active particles are considered as effective external forces originating from the environment. Such a framework is universal and especially convenient for analyzing mechanics of dry active systems, and it recovers the conventional scenario of mechanical equilibrium well-known in passive systems. Thus, our work is of fundamental importance to further explore mechanics and thermodynamics of complex active systems.</description>

      <title>Low Speed Oblique Impact Behavior On Granular Media Across Gravitational Conditions; The role of cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of impact provide rich insights from the evolution of granular bodies to their structural properties of the surface and subsurface layers of celestial bodies. Although chemical cohesive bonding has been observed in asteroid samples, and low-speed impact has been a subject of many studies, our understanding of the role of cohesion in these dynamics is limited, especially at small gravities such as those observed on asteroid surfaces. In this work, we use numerical discrete element method (DEM) and analytical dynamic resistive force theory (DRFT) modeling to examine the effect of cohesion on the outcome of the impact into loose granular media and explore scaling laws that predict impact behavior in the presence of cohesion under various gravitational conditions and cohesive strengths. We find that the effect of cohesion on the impact behavior becomes more significant in smaller gravitational acceleration, raising the need to scale the cohesion coefficient with gravity. We find that due to an insufficient understanding of confounding between cohesion and friction-induced quasi-static and inertial resistance, the outcomes of the DEM simulation models are incongruent with a suggested analytic model using Froude and Bond number scaling based on an additive contribution of frictional and inertial forces. Our study suggests that new dimensionless parameters and scaling are required to accurately capture the role of cohesion, given its ties to frictional behavior between the grain particles at different gravities.</description>

      <title>The effect of fiber plasticity on domain formation in soft biological composites -- Part II: An imperfection analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this work is to numerically investigate the effect of geometric imperfections on the macroscopic response and domain formation in soft biological composites that exhibit plasticity in the stiff (fiber) phase.This work builds on the corresponding bifurcation analysis in Part I of this study for simple laminates with perfectly flat layers under plane strain, nonmonotonic loading conditions, aligned with the layer direction. The post-bifurcation solution obtained in Part I for these materials corresponds physically to the formation of twin lamellar domains perpendicular to the loading axis, which is consistent with the chevron like deformation patterns that develop in tendons under cyclic loading. As biological materials are highly imperfect, and specifically tendons exhibit a high degree of so called crimp in the collagen fibers, in this study the effect of imperfections to the response is explored. For all composites with small initial imperfections that have been considered, the results of this work have been found to be in complete agreement with the corresponding analytical results of Part I, and, domains have been found to emerge at a macroscopically compressive state. However, as the imperfection amplitude is increased and becomes of the order to the layer width, or greater, domains begin to develop at macroscopically tensile stresses, which is in agreement with the fact that the loading of soft biological materials such as tendons and ligaments is tensile in nature. Thus, the findings of this work suggest strongly that plasticity and geometric imperfections of collagen fibers may play a key role on the onset and evolution of domains in actual soft biological composites.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Hopf solitons as generalized fold maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hopf index, a topological invariant that quantifies the linking of preimage fibers, is fundamental to the structure and stability of hopfions. In this work, we propose a new mathematical framework for modeling hopfions with high Hopf index, drawing on the language of singularity theory and the topology of differentiable maps. At the core of our approach is the notion of a generalized Hopf map of order $n$, whose structure is captured via fold maps and their Stein factorizations. We demonstrate that this theoretical construction not only aligns closely with recent experimental observations of high-Hopf-index hopfions, but also offers a precise classification of the possible configurations of fiber pairs associated to distinct points. Our results thus establish a robust bridge between the geometry of singular maps and the experimentally observed topology of complex field configurations of hopfions in materials and other physical systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties of the Frenkel-Kontorova model: Relation to tribological systems and fluid rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Frenkel-Kontorova model is a simple yet generic framework for the description of tribological phenomena and processes, including dry solid friction and the motion of adsorbed layers. As revealed in this work, it also reproduces qualitatively various features of complex liquids, such as, power-law sub-diffusion between the ballistic and the diffusive regimes as well as a cross-over from a non-Arrhenius to an Arrhenius dependence of the diffusion coefficient near the temperature, where the specific heat assumes its maximum. The study of these and related thermal and kinetic properties highlights several misconceptions prevalent in the literature. Most notably, shear thinning with a shear-thinning exponent close to zero can be the natural consequence from enforced basin hopping: the energy drops caused by shear-induced instabilities dictate the friction-velocity dependence at medium shear rates rather than the way how shear forces reduce the free energy barriers for directed motion. Thus, even if the rheology is described by semi-empirical theories such as the Eyring model, any agreement with experimental data, whether past, present, or future, may be purely coincidental.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Stability in Tensionless Phase-Separated Quorum-Sensing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial phenomena of motility-induced phase separation of active particles challenge our conventional understanding of phase coexistence. Despite the ubiquity of nonmechanical communication couplings among real active particles, most works on active interface have concentrated on active Brownian systems with steric interparticle interactions. Here, we study the interfacial behavior of phase-separated active particles interacting solely via quorum-sensing communications using both theory and simulations. Strikingly, we find that the quorum-sensing active system exhibits vanishing mechanical surface tension but nonzero effective capillary surface tension. We further demonstrate that the mechanical equilibrium of the tensionless interface is sustained by polarization force at the interface; while its dynamics is governed by the surface stiffness, which arises from tangential particle flux induced by local interfacial deformation. Our work reveals the fundamental distinction between mechanical and capillary surface tensions in active matter and paves the way for future exploration of active interface phenomena.</description>

      <title>Neutron reflectometry on superspreading and non-superspreading trisiloxane surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain trisiloxane surfactants have the remarkable property of being able to superspread: Small volumes of water rapidly wet large areas of hydrophobic surfaces. The molecular properties of the surfactants which govern this technologically relevant effect are still under debate. To gain a deeper understanding, the surfactant behaviour during the spreading process needs to be studied at molecular length scales. Here, we present neutron reflectivity analyses of two trisiloxane surfactants of similar chemical structure, of which only one exhibits superspreading properties. We present an approach to determining the composition of the adsorbed surfactant layer in spread surfactant films at the solid-liquid interface, accounting for contributions from attenuated back-reflections of the neutron beam in films with thicknesses in the range of several tens to hundreds of micrometers. Differences between superspreading and non-superspreading surfactants with regard to their volume fraction profiles at the solid/liquid interface obtained in the self-consistent analysis of the reflectivity curves are in agreement with a simple explanation of the difference in spreading behaviour based on thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The Order-disorder Transition in Incompressible Polar Active Fluids with an Easy Axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dry active matter in an anisotropic medium is of experimental relevance, and the interplay between anisotropy and the dynamics of the active matter remains under-explored. Here, we derive the hydrodynamic equations of a generic dry polar active fluid that preferentially flows along a particular axis induced by the anisotropy of the medium. We then study its critical behavior at the order-disorder transition in which the symmetry between ``forward" and ``back" along the special axis is spontaneously broken. We obtain the critical static and dynamic exponents, mean velocity, and two point correlation functions exactly in three dimensions, and to two-loop level in two dimensions, by mapping our class of systems to the equilibrium Ising model with dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Design of Integrated Iontronic Circuits Based on Ionic Bipolar Junction Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems rely on ions and molecules as information carriers rather than electrons, motivating the development of devices that interface with biochemical systems for sensing, information processing, and actuation via spatiotemporal control of ions and molecules. Iontronics aims to achieve this vision by constructing devices composed of ion-conducting materials such as polyelectrolyte hydrogels, but advancing beyond simple single-stage circuit configurations that operate under steady-state conditions is a challenge. Here, we propose and model more complex ionic circuits, namely bistable flip-flop and ring oscillators, consisting of multiple ionic bipolar junction transistors (IBJTs). We begin by modeling and characterizing single IBJTs using both a simplified one-dimensional Nernst-Planck model and a more-detailed two-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, elucidating the effects of geometry, size, and fixed charge on the IBJT performance and response time. The one- and two-dimensional models exhibit good agreement, indicating negligible transverse inhomogeneities. Additionally, these models show that reducing the base width improves current amplification, a behavior analogous to electronic BJTs. Building on this understanding, by using the IBJTs as voltage inverters and buffers, we design and model more complex ionic circuits that dynamically change their states in response to ionic signals. Specifically, we demonstrate that the ionic flip-flop retains one-bit memory and that the ring oscillator achieves autonomous periodic self-oscillation without an external clock. Our work provides a foundation for designing dynamic iontronic circuitry using ionic conductors, enabling biochemical signal processing and logic operations based on ionic transport.</description>

      <title>Relationship between Structure and Dynamics of an Icosahedral Quasicrystal using Unsupervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structure, formation, and dynamics of a one-component model system that self-assembles into an icosahedral quasicrystal (IQC). Using molecular dynamics simulations combined with unsupervised machine learning techniques, we identify and characterize the unique structural motifs of IQCs, including icosahedral and dodecahedral arrangements, and quantify the evolution of local environments during the IQC formation process. Our analysis reveals that the formation of the IQC is driven by the emergence of distinct local clusters that serve as precursors to the fully developed quasicrystalline phase. Additionally, we examine the dynamics of the system across a range of temperatures, identifying transitions from vibrationally restricted motion to activated diffusion, and uncovering signatures of dynamic heterogeneity inherent to the quasicrystalline state. To directly connect structure and dynamics, we use a machine-learning-based order parameter to quantify the presence of distinct local environments across temperatures. We find that regions with high structural order, as captured by specific machine-learned classes, correlate with suppressed self-diffusion and minimal dynamical heterogeneity, consistent with phason-like motion within the IQC. In contrast, regions with lower structural order exhibit enhanced collective motion and increased dynamical heterogeneity. These results establish a quantitative framework for understanding the coupling between structural organization and dynamical processes in quasicrystals, providing new insights into the mechanisms governing IQC stability and dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During our previous modeling using all-atom molecular dynamics, we have identified several foldamers whose nanoscale behavior resembles that of classic bistable machines, namely the Euler archs and Duffing oscillators. However, time limitations of the all-atom molecular dynamics prevent us from performing a full-scale investigation of long-time behavior and prompt us to develop a coarse-grained model. In this work, we summarize our recent research on developing such models using the most widely available method called Martini.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production from Density Field Theories for interacting particles systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy production quantifies the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in non-equilibrium systems. Here, we develop a direct method to obtain closed, tractable expressions for entropy production in a broad class of dynamical density functional theories, from Dean's exact stochastic equation for microscopic densities to coarse-grained fluctuating-hydrodynamics models with density-dependent mobility. The method employs an Onsager-Machlup path-integral formulation. Our results reproduce particle-level calculations and matches recent Doi-Peliti treatments, confirming that the irregular noise structure of Dean's equation poses no obstacle when handled consistently. We further extend the framework to active mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions and to run-and-tumble or active-Brownian suspensions, generalizations that require a careful treatment of the spurious-drift. Our method furnishes a practical route to quantify irreversibility in density functional field theories and paves the way for systematic studies of entropy production in multi-field active fluids that couple density, momentum and orientation.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Low-Spin State Destabilization and Piezo-Chromic Effect in an Iron(II) Spin Crossover Complex with Pyrazol-Pyridine-Triazolate Coordination Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15369</link>

Abstract: Rapidly developing science and technology demand new materials with versatile and promising properties for practical applications. In this context, pseudo-octahedral iron(II) spin crossover (SCO) complexes are particularly appealing - not only for their fundamental scientific interest but also for their potential as key components in the development of multifunctional switchable molecular materials and novel technological applications. This work presents the synthesis and structure of a new mononuclear SCO complex [FeII(L)2]0*nMeOH (n = 2, 0) where L is the asymmetrically substituted tridentate ligand [4-trifluoromethylphenyl-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine]. Due to high trigonal distortion, the solvated form (n = 2) remains high spin (HS) at all temperatures. In contrast, the more regular Oh geometry of the unsolvated form, 4CF3, favors a complete spin transition (ST) at room temperature, which has been investigated, in the pressure interval 0-0.64 GPa, by means of its magnetic and optical properties. Contrary to intuition and experience, the increase of pressure on 4CF3 denotes a radically abnormal behavior of this ST, involving: i) decrease of the characteristic temperatures, ii) increase of the high-spin molar fraction in the temperature range where the low-spin state is stable at ambient pressure; iii) increase of the thermal hysteresis width; and iv) above certain threshold pressure, full stabilization of the high-spin state. All these observations have been explained in the framework of a thermodynamic that model based on the elastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Using stochastic thermodynamics with internal variables to capture orientational spreading in cell populations undergoing cyclic stretch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the modeling framework introduced in [N. Loy and L. Preziosi: Bull. Math. Bio., 85, 2023] to describe the dynamics of cell orientation under cyclic stretch. We propose a reformulation based on the principles of Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables introduced in [T. Leadbetter, P. Purohit, and C. Reina: PNAS Nexus, 2, 2023]. This approach allows us to describe not only the evolution of the orientation distribution, but also the observed spreading phenomenon. The insight provided by our model reveals an interesting phenomenon, which we call two-stage reorientation: when cells begin aligned with an energy maximum, their orientations spread before concentrating at the energy minimum. This theoretical prediction suggests a new experiment to test this modeling framework.</description>

      <title>The importance of being discrete -- An agent-based model for active nematics and more</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an agent-based model of active flexible rods. Inspired by cytoskeletal flows, we introduce activity by an internal flow that contributes to the dissipative forces. The active force between our agents is central and reciprocal, ensuring linear and angular momentum conservation. For nematic activity, we find spontaneous, thresholdless flows and stochastic flow-reorientation, which is accompanied by the formation of topological defects. Defects appear and vanish with activity-dependent rates, and $+1/2$-defects self-propel. These hallmarks of active turbulence are present even on the scale of individual agents. The particle-based interactions lead to an emergent coupling between density and orientation that generates density dipoles around $+1/2$-defects. Finally, we highlight the versatility of our agent-based model by presenting spontaneous flows in three dimensions and tissue growth. Our framework opens the way for an integrated description of living materials, including several forms of activity in the same system.</description>

      <title>TopoGEN: topology-driven microstructure generation for in silico modeling of fiber network mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fields of mechanobiology and biomechanics are expanding our understanding of the complex behavior of soft biological tissues across multiple scales. Given the intricate connection between tissue microstructure and its macroscale mechanical behavior, unraveling this mechanistic relationship remains an ongoing challenge. Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro models to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted investigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure visualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element networks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue behavior. However, there is still no clear way to systematically incorporate experimentally observed microstructural changes into in silico models of biological networks. In this work, we develop a novel framework to generate topologically-driven discrete fiber networks using high-resolution images that account for how environmental changes during polymerization influence the resulting structure. Leveraging these networks, we generate models of interconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under compression and are bending-resistant. The generative topology framework enables control over network-level features, such as fiber volume fraction and cross-link density, along with fiber-level properties, like length distribution, to simulate changes driven by different polymerization conditions. We validate the robustness of our simulations against experimental data in a collagen-specific study case where we examine nonlinear elastic responses of collagen networks across varying conditions. TopoGEN provides a tool for tissue biomechanics and engineering, helping to bridge microstructural insights and bulk mechanical behavior by linking image-derived microstructural topological organization to soft tissue mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a flat rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a randomly rough surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter describes systems whose constituents convert energy from their surroundings into directed motion, such as bacteria or catalytic colloids. We establish a thermodynamic law for dilute suspensions of interacting active particles in the form of a remarkable direct link between their dynamics and thermodynamics: The rate at which irreversibility is built up in the non-equilibrium steady state is a state function of the thermodynamic system parameters, namely the number of particles, the temperature and, as a distinctive characteristic of active matter, the swim pressure. Like in the famous fluctuation theorems of stochastic thermodynamics, irreversibility is a dynamical measure that quantifies the amount by which microscopic particle trajectories break time-reversal symmetry, without reference to the typically unobservable processes underlying self-propulsion. We derive the result for the paradigmatic model of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles with short-ranged repulsive interactions. Based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, we furthermore present a refined relation whose validity extends from the dilute into the phase-separated (MIPS) regime.</description>

      <title>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</description>

      <title>Cell divisions imprint long lasting elastic strain fields in epithelial tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of biological tissues, viewed as complex cellular materials, is the active generation of mechanical stresses by cellular processes, such as cell divisions. Each cellular event generates a force dipole that deforms the surrounding tissue. Therefore, a quantitative description of these force dipoles, and their consequences on tissue mechanics, is one of the central problems in understanding the overall tissue mechanics. In this work we analyze previously published experimental data on fruit fly \textit{D. melanogaster} wing epithelia to quantitatively describe the deformation fields induced by a cell-scale force dipole. We find that the measured deformation field can be explained by a simple model of fly epithelium as a linearly elastic sheet. This fact allows us to use measurements of the strain field around cellular events, such as cell divisions, to infer the magnitude and dynamics of the mechanical forces they generate. In particular, we find that cell divisions exert a transient isotropic force dipole field, corresponding to the temporary localisation of the cell nucleus to the tissue surface during the division, and traceless-symmetric force dipole field that remains detectable from the tissue strain field for up to about $3.5$ hours after the division. This is the timescale on which elastic strains are erased by other mechanical processes and therefore it corresponds to the tissue fluidization timescale. In summary, we have developed a method to infer force dipoles induced by cell divisions, by observing the strain field in the surrounding tissues. Using this method we quantitatively characterize mechanical forces generated during a cell division, and their effects on the tissue mechanics.</description>

      <title>Material properties of biomolecular condensates emerge from nanoscale dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>
