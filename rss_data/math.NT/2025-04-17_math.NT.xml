      <title>On a Problem by Erd\H{o}s and Mirsky on the ratio of the number of divisors of consecutive integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the closure of the set of all real numbers $\alpha$, such that there exist infinitely many integers $n$, such that $\alpha=\log\frac{d(n+1)}{d(n)}$, where $d$ is the number of divisors of $n$. We give improved lower bounds for the density of $\mathcal{L}$.</description>

      <title>Improvements on exponential sums related to Piatetski-Shapiro primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new bound to the exponential sum of the form $$ \sum_{h \sim H}\delta_h \mathop{\sum_{m\sim M}\sum_{n\sim N}}_{mn\sim x}a_{m}b_{n}\e\big(\alpha mn + h(mn + u)^{\gamma}\big), $$ by a new approach to the Type I sum. The sum can be applied to many problems related to Piatetski-Shapiro primes, which are primes of the form $\lfloor n^c \rfloor$. In this paper, we improve the admissible range of the Balog-Friedlander condition, which leads to an improvement to the ternary Goldbach problem with Piatetski-Shapiro primes. We also investigate the distribution of Piatetski-Shapiro primes in arithmetic progressions, Piatetski-Shapiro primes in the intersection of multiple Beatty sequences and so on.</description>

      <title>A note on the second supplementary law of rational power residue symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a natural generalization of the Legendre symbol, the $q$-th power residue symbol $(a/p)_q$ is defined for primes $p$ and $q$ with $p\equiv 1 \bmod q$. In this paper, we generalize the second supplementary law by providing an explicit condition for $(q/p)_q = 1$, when $p$ has a special form $p = \sum_{i=0}^{q-1} m^i n^{q-1-i}$. This condition is expressed in terms of the polylogarithm $\mathrm{Li}_{1-q}(x)$ of negative index. Our proof relies on an argument similar to Lemmermeyer's proof of Euler's conjectures for cubic residue.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic Asai $L$-functions for finite slope quadratic Hilbert eigenforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a two-variable $p$-adic Asai $L$-function for a finite-slope family of Hilbert modular forms over a real quadratic field (with one component of the weight, and the cyclotomic twist variable, varying independently). This generalizes a construction due to Grossi, Zerbes and the second author for ordinary families. Our construction relies on a ``nearly-overconvergent'' version of higher Coleman theory for Hilbert modular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of CM points on Shimura Curves and ternary theta series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an equidistribution statement for the reduction of Galois orbits of CM points on the special fiber of a Shimura curve over a totally real field, considering both the split and the ramified case. The main novelty of the ramified case consists in the use of the moduli interpretation of the Cerednik--Drinfeld uniformisation. Our result is achieved by associating to the reduction of CM points certain Hilbert modular forms of weight $3/2$ and by analyzing their Fourier coefficients. Moreover, we also deduce the Shimura curves case of the integral version of the Andr\'e--Oort conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the density of non-tempered (at any $p$-adic place) cuspidal representations for $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, varying over a family of representations ordered by their infinitesimal characters, is small -- confirming Sarnak's density hypothesis in this set-up. Among other ingredients, the proof uses tools from microlocal analysis for Lie group representations as developed by Nelson and Venkatesh. As an application, we prove that the Diophantine exponent of the $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[1/p])$-action on $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SO}_n(\mathbb{R})$ is \emph{optimal} -- resolving a conjecture of Ghosh, Gorodnik, and Nevo.</description>

      <title>On the counting function of cubic function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the counting function for cubic function fields, extending results of Zhao, who proved the existence of a secondary term in this counting function. Specifically, we improve the error term in the estimate for this counting function to $\mathcal{O}\big(X^{2/3+\epsilon}\big)$, which matches the best-known result, due to Bhargava, Taniguchi and Thorne, over $\mathbb{Q}$. Furthermore, we obtain estimates for the refined counting function, where one specifies the splitting behaviour of finitely many primes. Also in this case, our error term matches what is known for number fields. However, in the function field setting, the secondary term becomes more difficult to write down explicitly.
  Our proof uses geometry of numbers methods, which are especially effective for function fields. In particular, we obtain an exact formula for the number of orbits of cubic forms with fixed absolute discriminant. Moreover, by studying the one-level density of a family of Artin $L$-functions associated to these cubic fields, we prove an unconditional lower bound on the error term in the estimate for the refined counting function. This generalises a conditional result over $\mathbb{Q}$, due to Cho, Fiorilli, Lee and S\"odergren.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic congruences involving $\sqrt d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $d$ be an integer not divisible by $p$. We prove that $$ \prod_{1\le m,n\le p-1\atop p\nmid m^2-dn^2}\ (x-(m+n\sqrt{d})) \equiv \begin{cases}\sum_{k=1}^{p-2}\frac{k(k+1)}2x^{(k-1)(p-1)}\pmod p &amp;\text{if}\ (\frac dp)=1,\\\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}x^{2k(p-1)} \pmod p&amp;\text {if}\ (\frac dp)=-1, \end{cases}$$ where $(\frac dp)$ denotes the Legendre symbol. This extends a recent conjecture of N. Kalinin. We also obtain the Wolstenholme-type congruence $$\sum_{1\le m,n\le p-1\atop p\nmid m^2-dn^2}\ \ \frac1{m+n\sqrt d}\equiv0\pmod{p^2}.$$</description>

      <title>Murmurations for elliptic curves ordered by height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: He, Lee, Oliver, and Pozdnyakov [19] have empirically observed that the average of the $p$th coefficients of the $L$-functions of elliptic curves of particular ranks in a given range of conductors $N$ appears to approximate a continuous function of $p$, depending primarily on the parity of the rank. Hence the sum of $p$th coefficients against the root number also appears to approximate a continuous function, dubbed the murmuration density. However, it is not clear from this numerical data how to obtain an explicit formula for the murmuration density. Convergence of similar averages was proved by Zubrilina [32] for modular forms of weight 2 (of which elliptic curves form a thin subset) and analogous results for other families of automorphic forms have been obtained in further work [6,23]. Each of these works gives an explicit formula for the murmuration density. We consider a variant problem where the elliptic curves are ordered by naive height, and the $p$th coefficients are averaged over $p/N$ in a fixed interval. We give a conjecture for the murmuration density in this case, as an explicit but complicated sum of Bessel functions. This conjecture is motivated by a theorem about a variant problem where we sum the $n$th coefficients for $n$ with no small prime factors against a smooth weight function. We test this conjecture for elliptic curves of naive height up to $2^{28}$ and find good agreement with the data. The theorem is proved using the Voronoi summation formula, and the method should apply to many different families of $L$-functions. This is the first work to give an explicit formula for the murmuration density of a family of elliptic curves, in any ordering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an equidistribution result for the zeros of polynomials with integer coefficients and simple zeros. Specifically, we show that the normalized zero measures associated with a sequence of such polynomials, having small height relative to a certain compact set in the complex plane, converge to a canonical measure on the set. In particular, this result gives an equidistribution result for the conjugates of algebraic units, in the spirit of Bilu's work. Our approach involves lifting these polynomials to polynomial mappings in two variables and proving an equidistribution result for the normalized zero measures in this setting.</description>

      <title>On Darmon's program for the generalized Fermat equation, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15861v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2000, Darmon described a program to study the generalized Fermat equation using modularity of abelian varieties of $\mathrm{GL}_2$-type over totally real fields. The original approach was based on hard open conjectures, which have made it difficult to apply in practice. In this paper, building on the progress surrounding the modular method from the last two decades, we analyze and expand the current limits of this program by developing all the necessary ingredients to use Frey abelian varieties for new Diophantine applications. In particular, we deal with all but the fifth and last step in the modular method for Fermat equations of signature $(r,r,p)$ in almost full generality.
  As an application, for all integers $n \geq 2$, we give a resolution of the generalized Fermat equation $x^{11} + y^{11} = z^n$ for solutions $(a,b,c)$ such that $a + b$ satisfies certain $2$- or $11$-adic conditions.
  Moreover, the tools developed can be viewed as an advance in addressing a difficulty not treated in Darmon's original program: even assuming `big image' conjectures about residual Galois representations, one still needs to find a method to eliminate Hilbert newforms at the Serre level which do not have complex multiplication. In fact, we are able to reduce the problem of solving $x^5 + y^5 = z^p$ to Darmon's `big image conjecture', thus completing a line of ideas suggested in his original program, and notably only needing the Cartan case of his conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the phenomenon where an element in a number field is not integrally represented by a given positive definite quadratic form, but becomes integrally represented by this form over a totally real extension of odd degree. We prove that this phenomenon happens infinitely often, and, conversely, establish finiteness results about the situation when the quadratic form is fixed.</description>

      <title>The correspondence between consistent maps and measures on the places of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06519v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work of the author established dual representation theorems for certain vector spaces that arise in an important article of Allcock and Vaaler. These results constructed an object called a consistent map which acts like a measure on the set of places of $\overline{\mathbb Q}$, but is not a Borel measure on this space. We describe the appropriate ring of sets $\mathcal R$ for which every consistent map arises from a measure on $\mathcal R$. We further obtain the conditions under which a consistent map may be extended to a measure on the smallest algebra containing $\mathcal R$.</description>

      <title>Supersingular elliptic curves, quaternion algebras and applications to cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contains a survey of supersingular isogeny graphs associated to supersingular elliptic curves and their various applications to cryptography. Within limitation of space, we attempt to address a broad audience and make this part widely accessible. For those graphs we also present three recent results and sketch their proofs. We then discuss a generalization to superspecial isogeny graphs associated to superspecial abelian varieties with real multiplication. These graphs were introduced by Charles, Goren and Lauter and so our discussion is brief. Motivated by their cryptographic applications, we prove a general theorem concerning generation of lattices over totally real fields by elements of specified norm. Throughout the paper we have attempted to clarify certain considerations that are either vaguely stated in the literature, or are folklore. We hope this paper will be useful both to a novice wishing to familiarize themselves with this very active area, and to the expert who may enjoy some vignettes and an overview of some new results.</description>

Abstract: In order to study the analytic properties of the Goldbach generating function we consider a smooth version, similar to the Chebyshev function for the Prime Number Theorem. In this paper, we obtain explicit numerical estimates for the average order of its summatory function both in the classical case and in arithmetic progressions. In addition, we derive new explicit estimates for sums over zeros and for the function $\psi(u,\chi)$. Our results are general and describe how the explicit bounds depend on other known explicit estimates. These support the known asymptotic results under the (Generalised) Riemann Hypothesis involving error terms.</description>

      <title>$r$-primitive $k$-normal polynomials over finite fields with last two coefficients prescribed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\xi\in\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ be an $r$-primitive $k$-normal element over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q$ is a prime power and $m$ is a positive integer. The minimal polynomial of $\xi$ is referred to be the $r$-primitive $k$-normal polynomial of $\xi$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In this article, we study the existence of an $r$-primitive $k$-normal polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$ such that the last two coefficients are prescribed. In this context, first, we prove a sufficient condition which guarantees the existence of such a polynomial. Further, we compute all possible exceptional pairs $(q,m)$ in case of $3$-primitive $1$-normal polynomials for $m\geq 7$.</description>

      <title>On the fourth power level of $\mathfrak{p}$-adic completions of biquadratic number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $\mathfrak{p} \mid (2)$ be a prime ideal. We compute the fourth level of the $\mathfrak{p}$-adic completions of $K$ when the ramification index is $4$ and the inertial degree is trivial for the ideal $\mathfrak{p}$. This enables the computation of lower bounds for the fourth level of any number field of degree 4, provided that the integral basis is known. Here we apply this result to biquadratic number fields and obtain lower bounds for the fourth level of such number fields.</description>

      <title>Cotangent power sums and character coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that certain sums studied in two recent papers are basically character coordinates (as they are called in the literature). These sums involve values of Dirichlet characters and powers of $\cot(\pi k/n)$, $1\le k\le n-1$. We also show that a basic tool for the study of these sums was already given in 1987, in the form of the character coordinates of so-called cotangent numbers. By means of this tool, we obtain the results of the said papers in a simple and lucid way. We also show that the coefficients of the linear combinations used in the said papers are essentially the same.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>Are prime numbers and quadratic residues random?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04490v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Appeals to randomness in various number-theoretic constructions appear regularly in modern scientific publications. Such famous names as V.I. Arnold, M. Katz, Ya.G. Sinai, and T. Tao are just a few examples. Unfortunately, all of these approaches rely on various, although often very non-trivial and elegant, heuristics. A new analytical approach is proposed to address the issue of randomness/complexity of an individual deterministic sequence. This approach demonstrates the expected high complexity of quadratic residues and the unexpectedly low complexity in the case of prime numbers. Technically, our approach is based on a new construction of the dynamical entropy of a single trajectory, which measures its complexity, in contrast to classical Kolmogorov-Sinai and topological entropies, which measure the complexity of the entire dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean GUE corners and Hecke modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint distribution of singular numbers for all principal corners of a $p$-adic Hermitian (resp. alternating) matrix with additive Haar distribution, the non-archimedean analogue of the GUE (resp. aGUE) corners process. In the alternating case we find that it is a Hall-Littlewood process, explaining -- and recovering as a corollary -- results of Fulman-Kaplan. In the Hermitian case we obtain a `marginal distribution' of a formal Hall-Littlewood process with both positive and negative transition `probabilities'. The proofs relate natural random matrix operations to structural results of Hironaka and Hironaka-Sato on modules over the spherical Hecke algebra, yielding other probabilistic statements of independent interest along the way.</description>

      <title>The Density Finite Sums Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any set $A$ of natural numbers with positive upper Banach density and any $k\geq 1$, we show the existence of an infinite set $B\subset{\mathbb N}$ and a shift $t\geq0$ such that $A-t$ contains all sums of $m$ distinct elements from $B$ for all $m\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. This can be viewed as a density analog of Hindman's finite sums theorem. Our proof reveals the natural relationships among infinite sumsets, the dynamics underpinning arithmetic progressions, and homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie groups.</description>
