      <title>Closure operations induced via resolutions of singularities in characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the fact that the structure sheaf of a resolution of singularities, or regular alteration, pushes forward to a Cohen-Macaulay complex in characteristic zero with a differential graded algebra structure, we introduce a tight-closure-like operation on ideals in characteristic zero using the Koszul complex, which we call KH closure (Koszul-Hironaka). We prove it satisfies various strong colon capturing properties and a version of the Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem, and it behaves well under finite extensions. It detects rational singularities and is tighter than characteristic zero tight closure. Furthermore, its formation commutes with localization and it can be computed effectively. On the other hand, the product of the KH closures of ideals is not always contained in the KH closure of the product, as one might expect.</description>

      <title>Toric ideals of graphs minimally generated by a Gr\"obner basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing families of ideals that are minimally generated by at least one, or by all, of their reduced Gr\"obner bases is a central topic in commutative algebra. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of toric ideals of graphs. We say that a graph $G$ is an MG-graph if its toric ideal $I_G$ is minimally generated by some Gr\"obner basis, and a UMG-graph if every reduced Gr\"obner basis of $I_G$ forms a minimal generating set. We prove that a graph $G$ is a UMG-graph if and only if its toric ideal $I_G$ is a generalized robust ideal (that is, its universal Gr\"obner basis coincides with its universal Markov basis). Although the class of MG-graphs is not closed under taking subgraphs, we prove that it is hereditary, that is, closed under taking induced subgraphs. In addition, we describe two families of bipartite MG-graphs: ring graphs (which correspond to complete intersection toric ideals, as shown by Gitler, Reyes, and Villarreal) and graphs in which all chordless cycles have the same length. The latter extends a result of Ohsugi and Hibi, which corresponds to graphs whose chordless cycles are all of length $4$.</description>

      <title>Categorical matrix factorizations and monomorphism categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article generalizes the correspondence between matrix factorizations and maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over hypersurface rings due to Eisenbud and Yoshino. We consider factorizations with several factors in a purely categorical context, extending results of Sun and Zhang for Gorenstein projective module factorizations. Our formulation relies on a notion of hypersurface category and replaces Gorenstein projectives by objects of general Frobenius exact subcategories. We show that factorizations over such categories form again a Frobenius category. Our main result is then a triangle equivalence between the stable category of factorizations and that of chains of monomorphisms.</description>
