      <title>Quasi-Pfaffians and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a non-commutative generalization of the Pfaffian which we call a quasi-Pfaffian. This novel concept arises from solving linear systems with non-commutative skew-symmetric coefficients. A new non-commutative integrable system whose solutions are expressed in terms of these quasi-Pfaffians is presented. Derivative formulae and identities satisfied by these quasi-Pfaffians are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger--Poisson system on the complete, simply-connected Riemannian manifolds of constant sectional curvature. We obtain closed-form stationary spherically-symmetric solutions for the homogeneous equations for certain dimensions, and give some basic examples of solutions with a nonzero background.</description>

      <title>Matrix approximations of operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approximate representation of operators by finite matrices is analysed in terms of accuracy and convergence. The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $\delta$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle theory with a single constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to analyze the consistency of the deformation of the Heisenberg algebra in the setting of constrained Hamiltonian systems, providing a procedure to induce the deformation on the Poisson algebra after symplectic reduction. We investigate this in the context of the classical interpretation of Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories, treating two cases separately. For the first case, we consider a group action on the phase space together with a set of first-class constraints that can be interpreted as a momentum map. We furnish an explicit example in the case of rotational invariant deformed algebras. In the second case, we consider a single constraint provided by the Hamiltonian, which is a common instance in General Relativity, with straightforward application in cosmology.</description>

      <title>A Presymplectic and Symmetry Reduced Formulation of the Maxwell Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified geometric formulation of the Maxwell-Vlasov system using the infinite-dimensional Skinner-Rusk (SR) formalism. In this framework, particles and fields are treated simultaneously within a single presymplectic manifold, and the Gotay-Nester-Hinds algorithm recovers the full Maxwell-Vlasov equations as the compatibility conditions of a single variational system. The hierarchy of constraints -- including Vlasov advection, Gauss and Faraday laws, and the electromagnetic gauge structure -- arises naturally from the presymplectic geometry of the SR formalism.
  Reduction by the diffeomorphism group of phase space produces a reduced presymplectic manifold whose dynamics reproduces both the Euler-Poincare formulation for the Vlasov sector and the Marsden-Weinstein/Morrison-Greene Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structure. We further extend the construction to equilibria that partially break the relabeling symmetry, obtaining a translated SR system that yields an effective symplectic linearization, clarifies the appearance of Goldstone-type neutral modes, and provides a geometric foundation for the energy-Casimir method.
  Finally, we incorporate external antenna fields into this setting by introducing affine Hamiltonian controls and establishing a theory of controlled symmetry breaking within the reduced SR framework. This leads to controlled Lie-Poisson equations for plasma-antenna coupling and a geometric mechanism for stabilization through Casimir shaping and symmetry-selective forcing. The resulting picture provides a single presymplectic structure that unifies Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, gauge, reduction, and control-theoretic aspects of the Maxwell-Vlasov system.</description>

      <title>The Categorical 't Hooft Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review categorical aspects of 't Hooft's large $N$ expansion, which is expected to map any Quantum Field Theory of large matrices to a string theory. Our goal is to describe a general strategy to derive the string theory dual to given QFT, at least at the leading order in the 't Hooft expansion. The basic idea is to characterize the underlying worldsheet theory of the dual string theory as an extended two-dimensional differential graded Topological Field Theory (dg-TFT), i.e. present an $A_\infty$-category of boundary conditions ("D-branes"). A basic aspect of the 't Hooft expansion is that D-branes arise from the addition of vector-valued degrees of freedom to the QFT. We propose that formal deformations of such "fundamental modifications" must match the formal deformations of the dual D-branes, which in turn capture the $A_\infty$-category structure and thus the worldsheet dg-TFT. We discuss several systems for which a rigorous analysis along these lines is or should be possible.</description>

      <title>From the quantum Boltzmann operator to the quantum Landau operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we derive the quantum Landau operator as the weak-coupling limit of the quantum Boltzmann operator (also known as the Uehling-Uhlenbeck operator). We consider both Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. Our approach is inspired by the work by Benedetto and Pulvirenti, where the classical Landau operator was derived from the quantum Boltzmann operator. To capture the ternary term in the quantum Landau operator, we introduce a new two-parameter scaling that preserves the quantum effects in the limit. Furthermore, we provide an explicit rate of convergence that depends on the regularity of the interaction potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lagrange identity expresses the second derivative of the moment of inertia of a system of material points through kinetic energy and homogeneous potential energy, from which follows the Jacobi well-known result on the instability of a system of gravitating bodies. In this work, it is proven that if a Hamiltonian system satisfies the Lagrange identity, then it possesses additional tensor invariants that are not expressed through the basic invariants existing for all Hamiltonian systems. A new class of Hamiltonian systems with inhomogeneous potentials is considered, which also possess similar additional tensor invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of algorithms for the symbolic integration of hyperlogarithms multiplied by rational functions in the computer algebra system FORM. This implementation encompasses cases where hyperlogarithms have rational letters or a rational argument. It complements the previous implementation, HyperInt, in MAPLE by Erik Panzer, utilizing the advantages of FORM in the efficient handling of large symbolic expressions. Among a wide range of applications, this approach enables the computation of many Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Russo-Townsend formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out an example in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and a particular potential $W(\psi)$ is chosen such that integrating $\psi$ out gives the ModMaxBorn theory. We also briefly discuss a supersymmetric generalisation of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Cauchy problem for a Schr\"odinger-type equation related to the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem in the space $H^1(\Sigma)$ for a nonlinear damped Schr\"odinger equation of the form \[ i u_t + \Delta u + i \lambda u \, \zeta(|u|+1) = 0, \quad u(0,x) = u_0, \] where $\zeta$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. This equation involves a damping term inspired by a fundamental object from number theory. We first establish the uniqueness of solutions in the sense of distributions. Then, by considering a regularized problem, we prove the existence of a global solution in $H^1(\Sigma)$, using uniform energy estimates and compactness arguments. Finally, we show that the limiting solution indeed satisfies the original equation in the weak sense,In the last part of this work, we provide an explicit estimate for the mass associated with the equation \begin{equation}\tag{E0}\label{5454} i v_t + \Delta v + i\lambda \frac{v}{|v|} = 0, \qquad v(0,x)=v_0.</description>

      <title>High-pressure melting and elastic behavior of vanadium and niobium based on ab initio and machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under high pressure, the group-VB transition metals vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) exhibit simple crystal structures but complex physical behaviors, such as anomalous compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH). Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals.</description>

      <title>Mass Dependence of the Araki-Uhlmann Relative Entropy Across Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mass dependence of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a localized coherent excitation and the vacuum state of a free scalar quantum field on the $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for $d = 1, 2, 3$. In this context, the relative entropy admits a closed expression in terms of the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution, whose analytic structure is sensitive to both the mass and the spacetime dimensionality. Prior studies in $(1+1)$ dimensions have shown a monotonic decay of the relative entropy with increasing mass. We extend that analysis to higher dimensions using numerical techniques and elucidate how the interplay between dimensionality and mass controls the behavior of the relative entropy. Our results provide new insights for the study of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in QFT and its dependence on physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of $Q$-functions for the ${\cal Z}_r$ invariant inhomogeneous XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain near free fermion point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the beginning of the 70's, Baxter introduced a multiparametric generalization of the six-vertex model. This integrable system has been found to exhibit a remarkable variety of critical behaviors. The work is part of a series of papers devoted to their systematic study. We focus on the case when the lattice model possesses an additional ${\cal Z}_r$ symmetry and consider the critical behavior near the so-called free fermion point. Among other things, discussed is the algebra of extended conformal symmetry underlying the universal behavior. The main result of the paper is the class of differential equations that describe the scaling limit of the solutions to the Bethe Ansatz equations. This is an instance of the correspondence between Ordinary Differential Equations and Integrable Quantum Field Theory (ODE/IQFT correspondence).</description>

Abstract: We compute the full off-diagonal asymptotics of the equivariant and partial Bergman kernels associated with a circle action on a prequantized K\"ahler manifold with bounded geometry at infinity, then use these results to compute the asymptotics of the linear statistics of the associated determinantal point process as the number of points grows to infinity, showing that its distribution converges to a centered normal variable with variance given by the sum of an $H^1$-norm squared in the bulk and an $H^{1/2}$-norm squared on the boundary of the associated droplet.</description>

      <title>The fermionic DGFF and its scaling limit logCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify the scaling limit of the fermionic discrete Gaussian free field (fDGFF) as a logarithmic conformal field theory (CFT) in two dimensions. We first establish a one-to-one correspondence between the space of local observables of the fDGFF and the space of local fields of the symplectic fermions CFT, a logarithmic CFT with central charge $c = - 2$. This correspondence is meaningful in the sense that, when appropriately renormalised, the fDGFF correlation functions converge to corresponding CFT correlation functions in the scaling limit. As an application to these results, we interpret (the scaling limit of) certain local observables in the uniform spanning tree and the Abelian sandpile model as local fields of the symplectic fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl geometry is a natural extension of conformal geometry with Weyl covariance mediated by a Weyl connection. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham (FG) ambient construction for conformal manifolds to a corresponding construction for Weyl manifolds. We first introduce the Weyl-ambient metric motivated by the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham (WFG) gauge. From a top-down perspective, we show that the Weyl-ambient space as a pseudo-Riemannian geometry induces a codimension-2 Weyl geometry. Then, from a bottom-up perspective, we start from promoting a conformal manifold into a Weyl manifold by assigning a Weyl connection to the principal $\mathbb{R}_+$-bundle realizing a Weyl structure. We show that the Weyl structure admits a well-defined initial value problem, which determines the Weyl-ambient metric. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we also investigate Weyl-covariant tensors on the Weyl manifold and define extended Weyl-obstruction tensors explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiport networks, common in electrical engineering. They have boundary conditions different from electrical networks: the boundary vertices are split into pairs and the sum of the incoming currents is set to be zero in each pair. If one sets the voltage difference for each pair, then the incoming currents are uniquely determined. We generalize Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem to this setup. Different forests now contribute with different signs, making the proof subtle. In particular, we use the formula for the response matrix minors by R. Kenyon-D. Wilson, determinantal identities, and combinatorial bijections. We introduce superport networks, generalizing both ordinary networks and multiport ones.</description>

Abstract: For each of the four particle processes given by Dieker and Warren [arXiv:0707.1843], we show the $n$-step transition kernels are given by the (dual) (weak) refined symmetric Grothendieck functions up to a simple overall factor. We do so by encoding the particle dynamics as the basis of free fermions first introduced by the first author, which we translate into deformed Schur operators acting on partitions. We provide a direct combinatorial proof of this relationship in each case, where the defining tableaux naturally describe the particle motions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By the introduction of locally constant prefactorization algebras at a fixed scale, we show a mathematical incarnation of the fact that observables at a given scale of a topological field theory propagate to every scale over euclidean spaces. The key is that these prefactorization algebras over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For topological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners $\mathbb{R}^p\times\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we quantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Flat extensions of principal connections and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <title>Solving one-body ensemble N-representability problems with spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic quantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of orbitals $\varphi_i$ according to $0 \leq n_i \leq 2$. In this work, we first refine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into account simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness $\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a comprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation theory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the set of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully characterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation numbers, defining a convex polytope $\Sigma_{N,S}(\boldsymbol w) \subset [0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of orbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate them for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a crucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Functional Determinants of Radial Operators via Heat Kernel Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient regularization method for functional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficients. Our key finding is a systematic way to identify heat kernel coefficients in the angular momentum space. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernel expansion, which suffice to regularize up to 13-dimensional functional determinants. We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants, and make numerical computations more efficient. In the limit of a large angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin formulas in previous studies, but are extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral-zeta framework for quantum mechanics with the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{{\cal PT}}(x)=x^{2K}(ix)^{\varepsilon}$ $(K,\varepsilon \in {\mathbb N})$ and the Hermitian potential $V_{{\cal H}}(x)=x^{2M}$ $(M \in {\mathbb N}+1)$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system. Using the ODE/IM correspondence, we construct exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for the spectral zeta functions (SZFs) $\zeta_n(s)$. In contrast to recursive T-Q relations, the ZGFs provide fixed-source, closed-form mappings between different fusion sectors. For Hermitian $M=2$, our ESRs reproduce exact WKB results, extending them systematically to ${\cal PT}$ sectors and (half-)integer $M$. Our analysis reveals a phenomenon of \textit{algebraic information loss}, distinct from analytic ambiguity. The structure is governed by a selection rule ${\cal S}_n$, derived from the Chebyshev structure of fusion relations and $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik symmetry. For odd integer $M$, we identify a structural non-invertibility: mapping from \textit{odd} to \textit{even} fusion sectors causes exact coefficient cancellation due to phase interference, rendering the map non-invertible. This implies even-sector data carry strictly less information than odd-sector data, yielding a \textit{no-go} statement for inverse spectral reconstruction. Conversely, for even and half-integer $M$, all relevant sectors form an information-equivalent, mutually invertible family. Finally, we provide a spectral-zeta formulation of the massless Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS) conjecture. By connecting ${\cal PT}$ and Hermitian spectra via ZGFs, we establish a purely spectral-theoretic route to the conjectured relation, avoiding explicit analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Sheffer Polynomials and the s-ordering of Exponential Boson Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The s-ordered form of any product of single-mode boson creation and annihilation operators, containing only a single annihilator, is computed explicitly. The s-ordering concept originated in quantum optics, but subsumes normal, symmetric (Weyl), and anti-normal ordering for any two operators satisfying a canonical commutation relation. Because the s-ordering map can be viewed as producing a function of a complex variable, its inverse is a quantization map that takes such "classical" functions to quantum operators. The explicit s-ordered expressions are derived with the aid of a parametric family of Sheffer polynomial sequences (or equivalently a parametric exponential Riordan array of polynomial coefficients), called the Hsu-Shiue family. To yield orderings interpolating between normal and anti-normal, this family must be extended.</description>
