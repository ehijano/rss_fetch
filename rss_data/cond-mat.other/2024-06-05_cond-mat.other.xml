      <title>Timescale bridging in atomistic simulations of epoxy polymer mechanics using non-affine deformation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \sim 1 {\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Ring-Exchange Interaction Effects on Magnons in Dirac Magnet CoTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic interactions that determine magnetic order and magnon energies typically involve only two spins. While rare, multi-spin interactions can also appear in quantum magnets and be the driving force in the ground state selection and in the nature of its excitations. By performing time-domain terahertz and magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements combined with theoretical modeling, we determine the origin of the magnon excitation gap in Dirac antiferromagnet CoTiO$_3$. By adding a ring-exchange interaction in a hexagonal plaquette of the honeycomb lattice to both an XXZ spin model and to a low energy spin-orbital flavor wave model, a gap is generated in the magnon spectrum at the Brillouin zone center. With this addition, the flavor wave model reproduces a large swath of experimental results including terahertz, Raman, inelastic neutron scattering, and magnetization experiments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Convergence of Coupled Cluster Calculations of the Homogeneous Electron Gas Using Bayesian Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a system which has many applications in chemistry and physics. However, its infinite nature makes studies at the many-body level complicated due to long computational run times. Because it is size extensive, coupled cluster theory is capable of studying the homogeneous electron gas, but it still poses a large computational challenge as the time needed for precise calculations increases in a polynomial manner with the number of particles and single-particle states. Consequently, achieving convergence in energy calculations becomes challenging, if not prohibited, due to long computational run times and high computational resource requirements. This paper develops the sequential regression extrapolation (SRE) to predict the coupled cluster energies of the homogeneous electron gas in the complete basis limit using Bayesian ridge regression to make predictions from calculations at truncated basis sizes. Using the SRE method we were able to predict the coupled cluster doubles energies for the electron gas across a variety of values of N and $r_s$, for a total of 70 predictions, with an average error of 4.28x10$^{-4}$ Hartrees while saving 88.9 hours of computational time. The SRE method can accurately extrapolate electron gas energies to the complete basis limit, saving both computational time and resources. Additionally, the SRE is a general method that can be applied to a variety of systems, many-body methods, and extrapolations.</description>
