      <title>Bio-integrated ${\mu}$Bots with Overtone Ultra-Wideband Magnetoelectric Antennas for Wireless Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implantable and wearable devices require antennas that are both miniaturized and efficient, yet conventional designs are constrained by narrow bandwidth and orientation sensitivity. We report overtone ultra-wideband magnetoelectric (OUWB-ME) antennas that exploit higher order acoustic modes in polished silicon substrates to achieve a 22.6 GHz bandwidth in the 3-4 GHz range. Packaged into "${\mu}$Bots," these magnetoelectric heterostructures bonded with silver nanoparticle inks maintain stable operation under biological loading. In vitro assays confirm the biocompatibility of AlN and the protective role of parylene encapsulation for FeGa. Ex vivo rat and human tissues reshape transmission spectra, identifying reproducible frequency windows near 3.3 and 3.9 GHz. ${\mu}$Bots enable real-time audiovisual telemetry using software-defined radios and exhibit compatibility with 7T MRI. By combining wideband response, robustness to misalignment, and biocompatible packaging, OUWB-ME ${\mu}$Bots provide a scalable platform for wireless bio-integrated communication and telemetry.</description>

      <title>Single-Antenna Non-Line-of-Sight Matrix Imaging via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern imaging and sensing in complex environments, ranging from biomedical diagnostics to wireless communication, relies on accurately measuring and then controlling the wave propagation. Conventional approaches demand large arrays of antennas or transducers to reconstruct the full reflection or transmission matrix, enabling advanced protocols such as selective focusing or adaptive wave control. Yet, these arrays are expensive, bulky, and difficult to implement at microwave frequencies. Here, we show that a single transmitting-receiving antenna, when combined with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), can fully reconstruct the reflection matrix from far-field measurements, effectively transforming the RIS into a programmable synthetic antenna array. This approach allows high-fidelity imaging of complex scenes, selective focusing through clutter, and real-time tracking of moving targets. Our results establish RIS as a versatile, low-cost platform for matrix-based imaging, with broad implications for adaptive wave control, real-time sensing, and imaging in environments previously considered inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Catastrophic Collapse of Hybrid Exciton-Phonon Order in a Quantum Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the interactions binding electronic and lattice components of cooperative quantum order is central to sculpting new states of matter. This challenge is epitomized by the charge density wave material 1T-TiSe$_2$, where photoexcitation disrupts its presumed hybrid exciton-phonon order. This exposes a paradox: the electronic component collapses within femtoseconds while the periodic lattice distortion persists. If the lattice distortion outlives the excitonic condensate, were they truly intertwined? Here we resolve this by uncovering a low-frequency mode (approx. 0.13 THz) emerging only in the ordered state, signaling exciton-phonon coupling. This mode is consistent with a locked phason -- a collective excitation arising if coupling between the excitonic condensate and lattice reduces continuous phase symmetry to a discrete one, giving the excitonic Goldstone mode finite mass. This is captured by an effective theory describing a shared potential landscape. At a critical threshold, the collapse of excitonic order flattens the potential, triggering an exciton-phonon catastrophe: selective overheating of the charge density wave phonon, disappearance of the locked phason, and sudden loss of electronic coherence. Remarkably, the lattice distortion survives as a dynamically trapped, non-thermal remnant, confirmed by the anomalous temperature dependence of the phononic response. These findings demonstrate that coupled potential energy landscapes can be manipulated to selectively dismantle complex quantum orders, advancing material control through dynamical design.</description>

      <title>Lithographically Defined Si$_3$N$_4$ Torsional Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Torsion pendulums provide an opportunity to trap large masses in a potential weak enough to explore two-body gravitation. Cooled to, and then released from a ground state, weak quantum effects, including those from gravity, might reveal themselves in the evolving decoherence of a torsion pendulum, if its baseline dissipation were sufficiently dilute for quantum coherent oscillation. Monolithic ribbon-like, or multi-filar suspension geometries provide a key to such dilution in torsion, but are challenging to make. As a solution, we introduce a lithographically defined silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) ribbon suspension in a wafer-scale approach to pendulum fabrication that is conducive to such 2-D geometries, making extreme aspect ratios, and even multi-filar designs, a possibility. A monofilar, monolithic, centimeter scale torsion pendulum is fabricated and released in a first proof of concept. Mounted in vacuum, it is optically excited and cooled using measurement based feedback. Though only 37 mg, the device displays a fundamental frequency of 162 mHz and an undiluted Q of 12000, demonstrating a foundational step towards ultra-coherent, ultra-low frequency torsion pendulums.</description>

      <title>Low-Power Solar Sail Control using In-Plane Forces from Tunable Buckling of Kirigami Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-concept study showing that buckled aluminized polyimide films perforated with millimeter-scale cuts can redirect normally incident light obliquely and generate net in-plane force components parallel to the global solar sail surface. We use finite element simulations to obtain the buckled shapes of different periodic unit cell geometries and apply ray optics modeling to compute the resulting light-pressure forces. The simulations show that the buckled kirigami surfaces reflect light into different directions producing a net in-plane force parallel to the direction of stretching. We verify these trends experimentally by illuminating a tensioned kirigami sample with a laser and observing reflected beam patterns consistent with the ray optics simulations. These results suggest that kirigami films may offer a scalable, low-power, and lightweight way to achieve controllable in-plane forces for solar sail steering.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Input-Output Theory of Floquet Cavity Magnonics and Magnon Energy Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $\epsilon = (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous power generation and cooling using semiconductor-sensitized thermal cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript reports a semiconductor-sensitized thermal cell (STC) that converts ambient heat into electrical power while simultaneously reducing its own temperature under isothermal conditions. Using a printable semiconductor--electrolyte architecture, we fabricate $4\,\mathrm{cm} \times 4\,\mathrm{cm}$ devices that generate up to approximately $0.2\,\mathrm{mW}$ at temperatures of $40$--$55\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. During continuous discharge, the STC exhibits a transient temperature decrease followed by thermal equilibration with the environment. In contrast, periodic on--off discharge produces sustained cooling of approximately $1\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ relative to a non-discharging reference. Notably, parallel integration of four STCs yields a nonlinear enhancement of cooling (approximately $5\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$) without a corresponding increase in electrical output. The observed behavior can be understood within a macroscopic energy-balance framework, in which time modulation of electrochemical heat consumption prevents the establishment of thermal steady state. These results demonstrate sustained isothermal cooling induced by heat-to-electricity conversion at practical device scales, and highlight semiconductor-sensitized thermal cells as a platform for coupled energy harvesting and thermal management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As anyone who has blown across the mouth of a beer bottle knows, beer bottles have a well-defined fundamental frequency. This paper shows how a beer bottle's acoustical resonance can be modeled as a one-dimensional driven-damped oscillator and includes enough detail to be useful in undergraduate laboratory experiments. While the frequency-domain Green's function of the bottle can be extracted through sequential pure-tone measurements, sufficient data to fit the model's parameters can be collected in just a few seconds when Fourier methods are used.</description>

      <title>Long-Wave Infrared Spintronic Poisson Bolometers with High Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-sensitivity long-wave infrared (LWIR) detection is crucial for observing weak thermal radiation. Recently, the spintronic Poisson bolometer was proposed as a promising platform for uncooled infrared detection. The Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, establishing a new detection paradigm. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source, with the mean count rate modulated by incident radiation. In this work, we integrate a broadband plasmonic absorber optimized for LWIR absorption onto a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber achieves over 60\% absorptance across the LWIR spectrum, matching the blackbody radiation peak at room temperature. The device exhibits a best noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance among the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date. This work advances uncooled infrared detection toward cryogenic-level sensitivity through the innovation of integrating spintronic materials and plasmonic materials, opening pathways to high-sensitivity LWIR sensing and imaging applications such as remote sensing, high-speed imaging, cryogenic system diagnostics, and industrial monitoring.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to relax conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays. Using FDTD simulations of aluminum oxide microlenses, we analyze focal properties, collection efficiency, and concentration factor in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). A radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Plane--Convex Microcavity for Room-Temperature Polaritons with Geometric \(g\)-Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a plane--convex open microcavity that supports room-temperature polariton spectroscopy and offers a simple geometric handle on the coupling rate. The effective length ($L_{\mathrm{eff}}$) is absolutely calibrated from the free-spectral range, and piezo tuning is performed at near-normal incidence ($k_{\parallel}!\approx!0$) to avoid angle-induced degradation. Using spin-coated PEA$2$PbI$4$ quasi-2D perovskites, we observe clear anti-crossings in reflection, with vacuum Rabi splittings up to $71~\mathrm{meV}$ (reflection) and $87~\mathrm{meV}$ (PL) near $L{\mathrm{eff}}!\approx!3~\mu\mathrm{m}$. A linewidth-corrected analysis converts the apparent splitting into the coherent exciton--photon coupling rate $g$, revealing a robust geometric scaling $g \propto L{\mathrm{eff}}^{-1/2}$ across multiple longitudinal orders and spatial sites, consistent with the filled-mode thin-film limit where the transverse area cancels in the mode volume. The platform establishes a compact, broadly compatible testbed for room-temperature polaritons and provides a practical design rule: shortening $L_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is a reliable geometric lever to strengthen collective coupling in plane--convex microcavities.</description>

      <title>Plasma engineered Hydroxyl Defects in NiO a DFTSupported-Spectroscopic Analysis of Oxygen Hole States and Implications for Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling lattice oxygen reactivity in earth abundant OER catalysts requires precise tuning of defect chemistry in the oxide lattice. Here, we combine DFT+U calculations with plasma assisted synthesis to show how O2 and H2O in the discharge govern vacancy formation, electronic structure, and catalytic predisposition in NiO thin films. Oxygen rich plasmas generate isolated and clustered Ni vacancies that stabilize oxygen ligand hole states and produce shallow O 2p Ni 3d hybrid levels, enhancing Ni O covalency. In contrast, introducing H2O during growth drives local hydroxylation that compensates vacancy induced Ni3+ centers, restoring Ni2+ like coordination, suppressing deep divacancy derived in gap states, and introducing shallow Ni O H derived valence-band tails. EXAFS confirms that hydroxylation perturbs only the local environment while preserving the medium-range NiO lattice, and Ni L-edge spectroscopy shows a persistent but redistributed ligand-hole population. These complementary vacancy and hydroxylation driven pathways provide a plasma controlled route to pre define electronic defect landscapes in NiO and to tune its activation toward OER relevant NiOOH formation.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Material Volume Fractions in a Microwave Resonant Cavity Sensor Using Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A non-destructive, real-time method for estimating the volume fraction of a dielectric mixture inside a resonant cavity is presented. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach is used to estimate the fractional composition of two-phase dielectric mixtures inside a resonant cavity using scattering parameter (S-parameter) measurements. A rectangular cavity sensor with a strip feed structure is characterized using a vector network analyzer (VNA) from 0.01--20~GHz. The CNN is trained using both simulated and experimentally measured S-parameters and achieves high predictive accuracy even without de-embedding or filtering, demonstrating robustness to measurement imperfections. The simulation results achieve a coefficient of determination ($R^2$)=0.99 using $k$-fold cross-validation, while the experimental model using raw data achieves an $R^2=0.94$ with a mean absolute error (MAE) below 6\%. Data augmentation further improves the accuracy of the experimental prediction to above $R^2=0.998$ (MAE$&lt;$0.72\%). The proposed method enables rapid, non-destructive, accurate, low-cost, and real-time estimation of material fractions, illustrating strong potential for sensing applications in microwave material characterization.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for Simulating Polymer Solutions/Melts Behavior under Complex Flows using DPD-SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for simulating the non-Newtonian rheology of polymer melts in complex two-dimensional flows. The method couples Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) at the microscale with a GENERIC-compliant Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) at the macroscale, in a concurrent framework, overcoming the limitations of traditional Eulerian-based methods in capturing long-memory and history-dependent effects. At the microscale, DPD serves as a virtual rheometer, employing FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) bead-spring polymer chains. This approach provides key rheological properties, including shear-thinning and zero-shear-rate viscosities, relaxation times, and viscoelastic dynamics, which are quantified via Carreau-Yasuda fitting and spectral analysis. The LHMM couples SPH-derived strain rates with microscopic stress responses using the Irving-Kirkwood formalism. This approach enables a concurrent interaction between macroscopic strain rates and microscopic stress tensors, ensuring a consistent viscoelastic response across scales.The method is validated against benchmark flows, including Reverse Poiseuille Flow and flow through a Periodic Array of Cylinders, across Weissenberg numbers $0.5&lt;\text{Wi}&lt;30$ and low Reynolds numbers ($\text{Re}&lt;1$). A final demonstration of flow in a 2D porous medium highlights LHMM's capability to handle highly heterogeneous geometries. The LHMM is implemented in LAMMPS, making it suitable for integrating multiple models to describe microscales. In contrast, large-scale simulations efficiently utilize GPU and CPU resources, managing multiple coupling and time-scaling levels to maintain numerical stability and accuracy. The framework offers a predictive, constitutive-free tool that links microscopic polymer dynamics to macroscopic flow behavior, making it suitable for multiscale applications.</description>

      <title>On the impact of geometric variance on the performance of formed parts: A probabilistic approach on the example of airbag pressure bins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scatter in properties resulting from manufacturing is a great challenge in lightweight design, requiring consideration of not only the average mechanical performance but also the variance which is done e.g., by conservative safety factors. One contributor to this variance is the inherent geometric variability in the formed part. To isolate and quantify this effect, we present a probabilistic numerical study, aiming to assess the impact of geometric variance on the resulting part performance. By modelling geometric deviations stochastically, we aim to establish a correlation between the variance in geometry with the resulting variance in performance. The study is done on the example of an airbag pressure bin, where a better understanding of this correlation is crucial, as it allows for the design of a lighter part without changing the manufacturing process. Instead, we aim to implement more targeted and effective quality assurance, informed by the performance impact of geometric deviations.</description>

      <title>Influence of Radiation and AC Coupling on Time Performance of Analog Pixels Test Structures in 65 nm CMOS technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) in advanced CMOS imaging technologies are key to next-generation tracking systems for high-energy physics, where radiation hardness and precise vertex reconstruction are essential. As part of the ALICE ITS3 R&amp;D program in synergy with the CERN R&amp;D, we evaluated the performance of the Analog Pixel Test Structures (APTS) fabricated in the TPSCo 65 nm CMOS imaging process. The prototypes employ 10 um pitch pixels with a fast operational amplifier-based buffering stage at the output, enabling direct characterization of intrinsic sensor response. Beam tests with minimum ionizing particles assessed the timing and charge collection of DC- and AC-coupled designs, including devices exposed to 10^14 NIEL and 10^15 NIEL non ioninsing energy loss. DC-coupled sensors demonstrated stable performance, maintaining time resolution lower than 70 ps and &gt;99% detection efficiency up to 10^15 NIEL.
  AC-coupled sensors demonstrated a wide operational margin, with efficiencies above 99% for clusterization thresholds below 150 electrons. Even though the AC coupling allows higher reverse bias than DC-coupled sensors, the reduced signal amplitude lowers the signal-to-noise ratio, increasing the jitter contribution. At high reverse bias, the AC-coupled sensors achieve time resolutions comparable to the DC-coupled version, demonstrating the viability of both approaches. These results also suggest that combining the low capacitance of DC-coupled designs with the high-bias capability of AC coupling could further enhance time resolution.
  These results confirm the suitability of 65 nm MAPS for future collider detectors requiring high radiation tolerance, efficiency, and timing precision.</description>

      <title>Towards Animate Droplets: Active, Adaptive, and Autonomous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets, sub-millilitre liquid volumes with at least one interface, have traditionally served as compartments for storing, transporting, and delivering materials. Beyond familiar applications in food, coatings, and consumer goods, they find cutting-edge use in energy storage, sensing, and tissue engineering. The next frontier is their integration into animate matter, emerging materials defined by their levels of activity, adaptiveness, and autonomy. Easy to produce and dispense or print into complex structures, and with enormous chemical versatility, droplets are ideal building blocks for animate matter. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for advancing animacy in droplets and call for a more concerted effort to integrate novel mechanisms for motility, sensing, and decision-making into droplet design. Although research on active droplets spans more than a century, achieving true autonomy, where droplets process multiple stimuli and respond without external control, remains a central challenge. We hope to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration towards applications in consumer goods, microfluidics, adaptive optics, tissue engineering, and soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Advancing Machine Learning Optimization of Chiral Photonic Metasurface: Comparative Study of Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral photonic metasurfaces provide unique capabilities for tailoring light-matter interactions, which are essential for next-generation photonic devices. Here, we report an advanced optimization framework that combines deep learning and evolutionary algorithms to significantly improve both the design and performance of chiral photonic nanostructures. Building on previous work utilizing a three-layer perceptron reinforced learning and stochastic evolutionary algorithm with decaying changes and mass extinction for chiral photonic optimization, our study introduces a refined pipeline featuring a two-output neural network architecture to reduce the trade-off between high chiral dichroism (CD) and reflectivity. Additionally, we use an improved fitness function, and efficient data augmentation techniques. A comparative analysis between a neural network (NN)-based approach and a genetic algorithm (GA) is presented for structures of different interface pattern depth, material combinations, and geometric complexity. We demonstrate a twice higher CD and the impact of both the corner number and the refractive index contrast at the example of a GaP/air and PMMA/air metasurface as a result of superior optimization performance. Additionally, a substantial increase in the number of structures explored within limited computational resources is highlighted, with tailored spectral reflectivity suggested by our electromagnetic simulations, paving the way for chiral mirrors applicable to polarization-selective light-matter interaction studies.</description>

      <title>Modification of adhesion between microparticles and engineered silicon surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly overmoded and periodically loaded structures, such as the iris-line waveguide, offer an attractive solution for the efficient transportation of diffraction-prone THz pulses over long distances (hundreds of meters). This paper presents the full-scatter field theory that allows us to analytically derive all the spectral (modal) coefficients on the discontuities of the iris line. The spectral analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive surfaces. An advanced application of Lorentz's reciprocity theory, using a generalized guided-field configuration, is developed to reduce complexity of the mode-matching problem over nonuniform sections. The used technique is quite general and applies to a wide class of structures, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory agrees with and expands previously established techniques, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation. The used formulation also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</description>

      <title>How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</description>

      <title>Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
