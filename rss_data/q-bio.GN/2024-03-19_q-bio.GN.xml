      <title>stMCDI: Masked Conditional Diffusion Model with Graph Neural Network for Spatial Transcriptomics Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved transcriptomics represents a significant advancement in single-cell analysis by offering both gene expression data and their corresponding physical locations. However, this high degree of spatial resolution entails a drawback, as the resulting spatial transcriptomic data at the cellular level is notably plagued by a high incidence of missing values. Furthermore, most existing imputation methods either overlook the spatial information between spots or compromise the overall gene expression data distribution. To address these challenges, our primary focus is on effectively utilizing the spatial location information within spatial transcriptomic data to impute missing values, while preserving the overall data distribution. We introduce \textbf{stMCDI}, a novel conditional diffusion model for spatial transcriptomics data imputation, which employs a denoising network trained using randomly masked data portions as guidance, with the unmasked data serving as conditions. Additionally, it utilizes a GNN encoder to integrate the spatial position information, thereby enhancing model performance. The results obtained from spatial transcriptomics datasets elucidate the performance of our methods relative to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Path-GPTOmic: A Balanced Multi-modal Learning Framework for Survival Outcome Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For predicting cancer survival outcomes, standard approaches in clinical research are often based on two main modalities: pathology images for observing cell morphology features, and genomic (e.g., bulk RNA-seq) for quantifying gene expressions. However, existing pathology-genomic multi-modal algorithms face significant challenges: (1) Valuable biological insights regarding genes and gene-gene interactions are frequently overlooked; (2) one modality often dominates the optimization process, causing inadequate training for the other modality. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-modal ``Path-GPTOmic" framework for cancer survival outcome prediction. First, to extract valuable biological insights, we regulate the embedding space of a foundation model, scGPT, initially trained on single-cell RNA-seq data, making it adaptable for bulk RNA-seq data. Second, to address the imbalance-between-modalities problem, we propose a gradient modulation mechanism tailored to the Cox partial likelihood loss for survival prediction. The contributions of the modalities are dynamically monitored and adjusted during the training process, encouraging that both modalities are sufficiently trained. Evaluated on two TCGA(The Cancer Genome Atlas) datasets, our model achieves substantially improved survival prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sweetwater: An interpretable and adaptive autoencoder for efficient tissue deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) stands as a powerful tool for deciphering cellular heterogeneity and exploring gene expression profiles at high resolution. However, its high cost renders it impractical for extensive sample cohorts within routine clinical care, hindering its broader applicability. Hence, many methodologies have recently arised to estimate cell type proportions from bulk RNA-seq samples (known as deconvolution methods). However, they have several limitations: Many depend on selecting a robust scRNA-seq reference dataset, which is often challenging. Secondly, building reliable pseudobulk samples requires determining the optimal number of genes or cells involved in the simulated data generation process, which has not been studied in depth. Moreover, pseudobulk and bulk RNA-seq samples often exhibit distribution shifts. Finally, most modern deconvolution approaches behave as a black box, and the underlying mechanisms of the deconvolution task are still unknown, which can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we present Sweetwater, an adaptive and interpretable autoencoder able to efficiently deconvolve bulk RNA-seq and microarray samples leveraging multiple classes of reference data, such as scRNA-seq and single-nuclei RNA-seq. Moreover, it can be trained on a mixture of FACS-sorted FASTQ files, which we newly propose to use as this reduces platform-specific biases and may potentially outperform single-cell-based references. Also, we demonstrate that Sweetwater effectively uncovers biologically meaningful patterns during the training process, increasing the reliability of the results. Sweetwater is available at https://github.com/ubioinformat/Sweetwater, and we anticipate will facilitate and expedite the accurate examination of high-throughput clinical data across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Combining mutation and recombination statistics to infer clonal families in antibody repertoires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: B-cell repertoires are characterized by a diverse set of receptors of distinct specificities generated through two processes of somatic diversification: V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutations. B cell clonal families stem from the same V(D)J recombination event, but differ in their hypermutations. Clonal families identification is key to understanding B-cell repertoire function, evolution and dynamics. We present HILARy (High-precision Inference of Lineages in Antibody Repertoires), an efficient, fast and precise method to identify clonal families from single- or paired-chain repertoire sequencing datasets. HILARy combines probabilistic models that capture the receptor generation and selection statistics with adapted clustering methods to achieve consistently high inference accuracy. It automatically leverages the phylogenetic signal of shared mutations in difficult repertoire subsets. Exploiting the high sensitivity of the method, we find the statistics of evolutionary properties such as the site frequency spectrum and dN/dS ratio do not depend on the junction length. We also identify a broad range of selection pressures spanning two orders of magnitude.</description>
