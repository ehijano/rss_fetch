      <title>A multi-detector neutral helium atom microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) is an emerging technique that uses a beam of neutral atoms to image and analyse surfaces. The low energies ($\sim$64 meV) and completely non-destructive nature of the probe particles provide exceptional sensitivity for studying delicate samples and thin devices, including 2D materials. To date, around five such instruments have been constructed and are described in the literature. All represent the first attempts at SHeM construction in different laboratories, and use a single detection device. Here, we describe our second generation microscope, which is the first to offer multi-detector capabilities. The new instrument builds on recent research into SHeM optimisation and incorporates many improved design features over our previous instrument. We present measurements that highlight some of the unique capabilities the instrument provides, including 3D surface profiling, alternative imaging modes, and simultaneous acquisition of images from a mixed species beam.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Perfect State Transfer in Spin Chains via Parametrization of On-Site Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of state transfer in spin chains, with the aim of achieving perfect state transfer for quantum information processing applications. Previous research has mainly focused on manipulating inter-site couplings within spin chains; here, we investigate in detail the potential of modifying on-site energies to facilitate precise quantum information transfer. Our findings demonstrate that through targeted adjustments to the diagonal elements of the XY Hamiltonian and leveraging a genetic algorithm, quasi-perfect state transfer can be achieved with careful consideration of the system's spectral characteristics. This investigation into on-site energies offers an alternative approach for achieving high-fidelity state transfer, especially in cases where manipulation of inter-site couplings may be impractical. This study thus represents a significant advancement towards unlocking the diverse applications of spin chains within practical quantum information systems.</description>

      <title>Berry monopoles and divergent quantum metric in systems with non-integer band dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometric tensor, which is comprised of the Berry curvature and quantum metric, in a generalized Dirac two-band system with non-integer dispersion, $E(\mathbf{k})\sim k^{\alpha}$. Our analysis reveals that this type of dispersion introduces significant and novel effects on band geometry and topology. We calculate the Berry curvature and observe its redistribution in momentum space as $\alpha$ varies. Notably, despite this redistribution, the change in Chern number across topological transitions remains quantized as an integer, even for non-integer $\alpha$. We illustrate the physical implications of this redistribution by computing the orbital magnetization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Berry curvature and quantum metric can become concentrated and even diverge in regions of momentum space where the energy band exhibits high curvature or non-analytic behavior. While it is well established that Berry curvature monopoles form at band touchings, our findings indicate that they can also emerge at sharp band corners, even in the absence of band touchings.</description>

      <title>Explicit error bounds with commutator scaling for time-dependent product and multi-product formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product formula (PF), which approximates the time evolution under a many-body Hamiltonian by the product of local time evolution operators, is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum dynamics by quantum computers. It has been of great interest whether PFs have a bound of the error from the exact time evolution, which is expressed by commutators among local terms (called commutator scaling), since it brings the substantial suppression of the computational cost in the system size. Although recent studies have revealed the presence and the explicit formulas of the PF error bounds for time-independent systems, those for time-dependent Hamiltonians remain to be a difficult problem except for low-order PFs. In this paper, we derive an explicit error bound of generic PFs for smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians, which is expressed by commutators among local terms and their time derivatives. This error bound can also host the substantial suppression in the system size for generic local Hamiltonians with finite-, short-, and long-ranged interactions, thereby giving a much better estimate of gate counts. Our derivation employs Floquet theory; Embedding generic smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians into time-periodic ones, we map the time-dependent PF error to the time-independent one defined on an infinite-dimensional space. This approach allows to obtain the error bounds not only for the ordinary time-dependent PF but also for its various family. In particular, we also clarify the explicit error bound of a time-dependent multi-product formula, with which we can achieve much smaller error by a linear combination of time-dependent PFs. Our results will shed light on various applications of quantum computers, ranging from quantum simulation of nonequilibrium materials to faster algorithms exploiting time-dependent Hamiltonians like adiabatic state preparation.</description>
