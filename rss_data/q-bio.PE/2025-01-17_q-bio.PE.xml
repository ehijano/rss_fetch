      <title>On the stability of competitive ecological communities with pairwise and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecological communities intrigue researchers seeking to explain the emergence of biodiversity observed in nature. This raises a fundamental question. What sustains the stability and coexistence of species within these ecosystems? Traditional ecological models have largely been based on the assumption that species primarily engage in pairwise interactions. However, interactions in ecological systems may involve groups of three or more individuals, i.e. higher-order interactions. As a result, the question of how the combined effects of pairwise and higher-order interactions shape the stability of large ecological communities remains unresolved.
  This work addresses this gap by analyzing a model of competitive communities that incorporates both pairwise and higher-order interactions. Using analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we find that higher-order interactions alone are not always sufficient to foster and maintain coexistence. When species are identical (i.e., have the same physiological rates), even a small proportion of higher-order interactions can stabilize their dynamics. However, when more realistic factors, such as varied birth and death rates or complex interaction structures are introduced, a finite fraction of higher-order interactions may not be sufficient to achieve stable coexistence. Our findings challenge the role of higher-order interactions as a universal stabilizing mechanism in ecological communities and open new avenues for research into the interplay of different factors that underpin biodiversity and ecosystem stability.</description>

      <title>Predicting the depth of the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ species: the impact of phylogenetic tree shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following question: how close to the ancestral root of a phylogenetic tree is the most recent common ancestor of $k$ species randomly sampled from the tips of the tree? For trees having shapes predicted by the Yule-Harding model, it is known that the most recent common ancestor is likely to be close to (or equal to) the root of the full tree, even as $n$ becomes large (for $k$ fixed). However, this result does not extend to models of tree shape that more closely describe phylogenies encountered in evolutionary biology. We investigate the impact of tree shape (via the Aldous $\beta-$splitting model) to predict the number of edges that separate the most recent common ancestor of a random sample of $k$ tip species and the root of the parent tree they are sampled from. Both exact and asymptotic results are presented. We also briefly consider a variation of the process in which a random number of tip species are sampled.</description>

      <title>Bacterial proliferation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria can form a great variety of spatially heterogeneous cell density patterns, ranging from simple concentric rings to dynamical spiral waves appearing in growing colonies. These pattern formation phenomena are important as they reflect how cellular processes such as metabolism operate in heterogeneous chemical environments. In the laboratory, they can be studied in simplified set-ups, where spatial gradients of oxygen and nutrients are externally imposed, and cells are immobilized in a gel matrix. An intriguing example, observed in such set-ups over 80 years ago, is the sequential formation of narrow bands of high cell density, taking place even for a clonal population. However, key aspects of the dynamics of band formation remained obscure. Using time-lapse imaging of replicate transparent columns in simplified growth media, we first quantify the precision of the positioning and timing of band formation. We also show that the appearance and position of different bands can be modulated independently. This "modularity" is suggested by the observation that different bands differ in their gene expression, and it is reproduced by a theoretical model based on the existence of internal metabolic states and the induction of a pH gradient. Finally, we can also modify the observed pattern formation by introducing genetic modifications that impair selected metabolic pathways. In our opinion, the possibility of precise measurements and controls, together with the simplicity and richness of the "proliferation pattern formation" phenomenon, can make it a model system to study the response of cellular processes to heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>The Science of Urban Metabolism and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantitative patterns behind scientific disciplines is fundamental for informed research policy. While many fields have been studied from this perspective, Urban Science (USc) and its subfields remain underexplored. As organisms, urban systems rely on materials and energy inputs and transformation (i.e. metabolism) to sustain essential dynamics. This concept has been adopted by various disciplines, including architecture and sociology, and by those focused on metabolic processes, such as ecology and industrial ecology. This study addresses the structure and evolution of Urban Metabolism (UM) and Sustainability research, analyzing articles by disciplines, study subjects (e.g., cities, regions), methodologies, and author diversity (nationality and gender). Our review suggests that UM is an emerging field that grew until 2019, primarily addressed by environmental science and ecology. Common methods include Ecological Network Analysis, and Life Cycle Assessment, and Material Flow Analysis, focusing flows over stocks, ecosystem dynamics and evolutionary perspectives of the urban system. Authors are predominantly from China and the USA, and there are less gender gaps compared to general science research. Our analysis identifies relevant challenges that have become evident in the statistical properties of this scientific field and which might be helpful for the design of improved research policies.</description>

      <title>Measuring net effects in signed ecological and social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With improvements in data resolution and quality, researchers can now construct detailed representations of complex systems as signed, weighted, and directed networks. In this article, we introduce a framework for measuring net and indirect effects without simplifying these information-rich networks. Building on a generalization of Katz centrality, this framework captures both direct and indirect interactions, the effect of the whole network on a node and its reverse, the effect of a node on the whole network, while accommodating the complexity of signed, weighted, and directed edges.
  To contextualize our contribution, we propose a taxonomy that unifies existing approaches and measures from the literature. We then apply our measure to ecological networks, where net and indirect effects remain critical yet difficult to quantify factors influencing coexistence. Specifically, we observe a strong correlation between negative net effects and species extinction in generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics. Additionally, we test our framework on a real-world social network, where it effectively identifies informative importance rankings, providing insights into influence propagation and power dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of two-compartment cell proliferation models with regulatory mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of a stochastic two-compartmental cell division system with regulatory mechanisms inspired by Getto et al. (2013). The hematopoietic system is modeled as a two-compartment system, where the first compartment consists of dividing cells in the bone marrow, referred to as type $0$ cells, and the second compartment consists of post-mitotic cells in the blood, referred to as type $1$ cells. Division and self-renewal of type $0$ cells are regulated by the population density of type $1$ cells. By scaling up the initial population, we demonstrate that the scaled dynamics converges in distribution to the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This system of ODEs exhibits a unique non-trivial equilibrium that is globally stable. Furthermore, we establish that the scaled fluctuations of the density dynamics converge in law to a linear diffusion process with time-dependent coefficients. When the initial data is Gaussian, the limit process is a Gauss-Markov process. We analyze its asymptotic properties to elucidate the joint structure of both compartments over large times. This is achieved by proving exponential convergence in the 2-Wasserstein metric for the associated Gaussian measures on an $L^{2}$ Hilbert space. Finally, we apply our results to compare the effects of regulating division and self-renewal of type $0$ cells, providing insights into their respective roles in maintaining hematopoietic system stability.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.</description>
