      <title>Cooperative ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis, Scaling Laws and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks are investigated with the objective of effectively balancing the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose an innovative networked ISAC scheme, where multiple transceivers are employed for collaboratively enhancing the S&amp;C services. Then, the potent tool of stochastic geometry is exploited for characterizing the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate the key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize salient network-level parameters. Remarkably, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expression of the localization accuracy derived unveils a significant finding: Deploying N ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced average cooperative sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the ln^2N scaling law. Crucially, this scaling law is less pronounced in comparison to the performance enhancement of N^2 achieved when the transceivers are equidistant from the target, which is primarily due to the substantial path loss from the distant base stations (BSs) and leads to reduced contributions to sensing performance gain. Moreover, we derive a tight expression of the communication rate, and present a low-complexity algorithm to determine the optimal cooperative cluster size. Based on our expression derived for the S&amp;C performance, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the network performance in terms of two joint S&amp;C metrics. To this end, we jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes and the transmit power to strike a flexible tradeoff between the S&amp;C performance.</description>

      <title>Latency-Distortion Tradeoffs in Communicating Classification Results over Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the problem of communicating decisions of a classifier over a noisy channel is considered. With machine learning based models being used in variety of time-sensitive applications, transmission of these decisions in a reliable and timely manner is of significant importance. To this end, we study the scenario where a probability vector (representing the decisions of a classifier) at the transmitter, needs to be transmitted over a noisy channel. Assuming that the distortion between the original probability vector and the reconstructed one at the receiver is measured via f-divergence, we study the trade-off between transmission latency and the distortion. We completely analyze this trade-off using uniform, lattice, and sparse lattice-based quantization techniques to encode the probability vector by first characterizing bit budgets for each technique given a requirement on the allowed source distortion. These bounds are then combined with results from finite-blocklength literature to provide a framework for analyzing the effects of both quantization distortion and distortion due to decoding error probability (i.e., channel effects) on the incurred transmission latency. Our results show that there is an interesting interplay between source distortion (i.e., distortion for the probability vector measured via f-divergence) and the subsequent channel encoding/decoding parameters; and indicate that a joint design of these parameters is crucial to navigate the latency-distortion tradeoff. We study the impact of changing different parameters (e.g. number of classes, SNR, source distortion) on the latency-distortion tradeoff and perform experiments on AWGN and fading channels. Our results indicate that sparse lattice-based quantization is the most effective at minimizing latency across various regimes and for sparse, high-dimensional probability vectors (i.e., high number of classes).</description>

      <title>Neural Compress-and-Forward for the Relay Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relay channel, consisting of a source-destination pair and a relay, is a fundamental component of cooperative communications. While the capacity of a general relay channel remains unknown, various relaying strategies, including compress-and-forward (CF), have been proposed. For CF, given the correlated signals at the relay and destination, distributed compression techniques, such as Wyner-Ziv coding, can be harnessed to utilize the relay-to-destination link more efficiently. In light of the recent advancements in neural network-based distributed compression, we revisit the relay channel problem, where we integrate a learned one-shot Wyner--Ziv compressor into a primitive relay channel with a finite-capacity and orthogonal (or out-of-band) relay-to-destination link. The resulting neural CF scheme demonstrates that our task-oriented compressor recovers "binning" of the quantized indices at the relay, mimicking the optimal asymptotic CF strategy, although no structure exploiting the knowledge of source statistics was imposed into the design. We show that the proposed neural CF scheme, employing finite order modulation, operates closely to the capacity of a primitive relay channel that assumes a Gaussian codebook. Our learned compressor provides the first proof-of-concept work toward a practical neural CF relaying scheme.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Optical IRS-Assisted VLC System via Spatial Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) has been considered a promising technology for visible light communication (VLC) by constructing visual line-of-sight propagation paths to address the signal blockage issue. However, the existing works on OIRSs are mostly based on perfect channel state information (CSI), whose acquisition appears to be challenging due to the passive nature of the OIRS. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a customized channel estimation algorithm for OIRSs. Specifically, we first unveil the OIRS spatial coherence characteristics and derive the coherence distance in closed form. Based on this property, a spatial sampling-based algorithm is proposed to estimate the OIRS-reflected channel, by dividing the OIRS into multiple subarrays based on the coherence distance and sequentially estimating their associated CSI, followed by an interpolation to retrieve the full CSI. Simulation results validate the derived OIRS spatial coherence and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed OIRS channel estimation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Optical Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted VLC System: A Joint Space-Time Sampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) has attracted increasing attention due to its capability of overcoming signal blockages in visible light communication (VLC), an emerging technology for the next-generation advanced transceivers. However, current works on OIRS predominantly assume known channel state information (CSI), which is essential to practical OIRS configuration. To bridge such a gap, this paper proposes a new and customized channel estimation protocol for OIRSs under the alignment-based channel model. Specifically, we first unveil OIRS spatial and temporal coherence characteristics and derive the coherence distance and the coherence time in closed form. Next, to achieve fast beam alignment over different coherence time, we propose to dynamically tune the rotational angles of the OIRS reflecting elements following a geometric optics-based non-uniform codebook. Given the above beam alignment, we propose an efficient joint space-time sampling-based algorithm to estimate the OIRS channel. In particular, we divide the OIRS into multiple subarrays based on the coherence distance and sequentially estimate their associated CSI, followed by a spacetime interpolation to retrieve full CSI for other non-aligned transceiver antennas. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed OIRS channel estimation scheme as compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>GLDPC-PC Codes: Channel Coding Towards 6G Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication system will improve the key technical indicators by one to two orders of magnitude, and come with some new features. As a crucial technique to enhance the reliability and efficiency of data transmission, the next generation channel coding is not only required to satisfy the stringent requirements of 6G, but also expected to be backward compatible to avoid imposing additional burden on the crowded baseband chip. This article provides an overview of the potential channel codes for 6G communications. In addition, we explore to develop next-generation channel codes based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) and polar frameworks, introducing a novel concept called generalized LDPC with polar-like component (GLDPC-PC) codes. The codes have exhibited promising error correction performance and manageable complexity, which can be further optimized by specific code design. The opportunities and challenges of GLDPC-PC codes are also discussed, considering the practical applications to 6G communication systems.</description>

      <title>GLDPC-PC Codes for MIMO Systems with Iterative Detection and Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the integration of GLDPC codes with short polar-like component codes, termed GLDPC codes with polar component codes (GLDPC-PC). This approach leverages the good distance properties of polar-like codes and mitigates their high decoding latency in long block lengths. A recently proposed soft-input soft-output decoder for polar-like codes enables effective iterative belief propagation decoding for GLDPC-PC, ensuring a low error floor under additive white Gaussian noise channels. Simulation results demonstrate that GLDPC-PC codes achieve significant performance improvements in multiple-input multiple-output systems with iterative detection and decoding (IDD). The proposed GLDPC-PC codes and the IDD scheme can be applied to various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalability and Implementation Aspects of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of scalability for a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system performing Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). Specifically, the case in which a large number of access points (APs) are deployed to perform simultaneous communication with mobile users and surveillance of the surrounding environment in the same time-frequency slot is considered, and a target-centric approach on top of the user-centric approach used for communication services is introduced. Consideration of other practical aspects such as the fronthaul load and scanning protocol issues are also treated in the paper. The proposed scalable ISAC-enabled system has lower levels of system complexity, permits to manage the case in which multiple targets are to be tracked/sensed, and achieves performance levels superior or in some cases close to those of the non-scalable solutions.</description>

      <title>Short Regular Girth-8 QC-LDPC Codes From Exponent Matrices with Vertical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenge of constructing short girth-8 quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, a novel construction framework based on vertical symmetry (VS) is proposed. Basic properties of the VS structure are presented. With the aid of these properties, existing explicit constructions for column weights from three to five which can be transformed into the VS structure are sorted out. Then two novel explicit constructions with the VS structure which guarantee short codes are presented for column weights of three and six. Moreover, an efficient search-based method is also proposed to find short codes with the VS structure. Compared with the state-of-the-art benchmarks, both the explicit constructions and the search-based method presented in this paper can provide shorter codes for most cases. Simulation results show that the new shorter codes can perform almost the same as or better than the longer existing counterparts. Thus, the new shorter codes can fit better with the low-latency requirement for modern communication systems.</description>

      <title>Outage Probability Analysis of Wireless Paths with Faulty Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a next generation wireless network incorporating a base station a set of typically low-cost and faulty Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). The base station needs to select the path including the RIS to provide the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the user. We study the effect of the number of elements, distance and RIS hardware failure on the path outage probability, and based on the known signal propagation model at high frequencies, derive the closed-form expression for the said probability of outage. Numerical results show the path outage likelihood as function of the probability of hardware failure of RIS elements, the number of elements, and the distance between mobile users and the RIS.</description>

      <title>Flexible Field Sizes in Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication via Efficient Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new secure distributed matrix multiplication (SDMM) scheme using the inner product partitioning. We construct a scheme with a minimal number of workers and no redundancy, and another scheme with redundancy against stragglers. Unlike previous constructions in the literature, we do not utilize algebraic methods such as locally repairable codes or algebraic geometry codes. Our construction, which is based on generalized Reed-Solomon codes, improves the flexibility of the field size as it does not assume any divisibility constraints among the different parameters. We achieve a minimal number of workers by efficiently canceling all interference terms with a suitable orthogonal decoding vector. Finally, we discuss how the MDS conjecture impacts the smallest achievable field size for SDMM schemes and show that our construction almost achieves the bound given by the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Linear-Function Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study linear-function correcting codes, a class of codes designed to protect linear function evaluations of a message against errors. The work "Function-Correcting Codes" by Lenz et al. 2023 provides a graphical representation for the problem of constructing function-correcting codes. We use this graph to get a lower bound the on redundancy required for function correction. By considering the function to be a bijection, such an approach also provides a lower bound on the redundancy required for classical systematic error correcting codes. For linear-function correction, we characterise the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of this graph, which gives rise to lower bounds on redundancy. The work "Function-Correcting Codes" gives an equivalence between function-correcting codes and irregular-distance codes. We identify a structure imposed by linearity on the distance requirement of the equivalent irregular-distance code which provides a simplified Plotkin-like bound. We propose a version of the sphere packing bound for linear-function correcting codes. We identify a class of linear functions for which an upper bound proposed by Lenz et al., is tight. We also identify a class of functions for which coset-wise coding is equivalent to a lower dimensional classical error correction problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of memory sampling in status updating systems, where source updates are published in shared memory, and reader process samples the memory for source updates by paying a sampling cost. We formulate a discrete-time decision problem to find a sampling policy that minimizes average cost comprising age at the client and the cost incurred due to sampling. We establish that an optimal policy is a stationary and deterministic threshold-type policy, and subsequently derive optimal threshold and the corresponding optimal average cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive eigenvalue bounds for the $t$-distance chromatic number of a graph, which is a generalization of the classical chromatic number. We apply such bounds to hypercube graphs, providing alternative spectral proofs for results by Ngo, Du and Graham [Inf. Process. Lett., 2002], and improving their bound for several instances. We also apply the eigenvalue bounds to Lee graphs, extending results by Kim and Kim [Discrete Appl. Math., 2011]. Finally, we provide a complete characterization for the existence of perfect Lee codes of minimum distance $3$. In order to prove our results, we use a mix of spectral and number theory tools. Our results, which provide the first application of spectral methods to Lee codes, illustrate that such methods succeed to capture the nature of the Lee metric.</description>

      <title>Improving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for permutation Codes in the Cayley metric and Kendall $\tau$-Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cayley distance between two permutations $\pi, \sigma \in S_n$ is the minimum number of \textit{transpositions} required to obtain the permutation $\sigma$ from $\pi$. When we only allow adjacent transpositions, the minimum number of such transpositions to obtain $\sigma$ from $\pi$ is referred to the Kendall $\tau$-distance. A set $C$ of permutation words of length $n$ is called a $t$-Cayley permutation code if every pair of distinct permutations in $C$ has Cayley distance greater than $t$. A $t$-Kendall permutation code is defined similarly. Let $C(n,t)$ and $K(n,t)$ be the maximum size of a $t$-Cayley and a $t$-Kendall permutation code of length $n$, respectively. In this paper, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor $\log(n)$, namely \[ C(n,t) \geq \Omega_t\left(\frac{n!\log n}{n^{2t}}\right) \text{ and } K(n,t) \geq \Omega_t\left(\frac{n! \log n}{n^t}\right).\] Our proof is based on graph theory techniques.</description>

      <title>Blackwell-Monotone Information Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Blackwell-monotone information cost function assigns higher costs to Blackwell more informative experiments. This paper provides simple necessary and sufficient conditions for Blackwell monotonicity over finite experiments. The key condition is a system of linear differential inequalities that are convenient to check given an arbitrary cost function. When the cost function is additively separable across signals, our characterization implies that Blackwell monotonicity is equivalent to sublinearity. This identifies a wide range of practical information cost functions. Finally, we apply our results to bargaining and persuasion problems with costly information.</description>

      <title>Lossless and Near-Lossless Compression for Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growth of model sizes and scale of their deployment, their sheer size burdens the infrastructure requiring more network and more storage to accommodate these. While there is a vast literature about reducing model sizes, we investigate a more traditional type of compression -- one that compresses the model to a smaller form and is coupled with a decompression algorithm that returns it to its original size -- namely lossless compression. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that such lossless compression can gain significant network and storage reduction on popular models, at times reducing over $50\%$ of the model size. We investigate the source of model compressibility, introduce compression variants tailored for models and categorize models to compressibility groups. We also introduce a tunable lossy compression technique that can further reduce size even on the less compressible models with little to no effect on the model accuracy. We estimate that these methods could save over an ExaByte per month of network traffic downloaded from a large model hub like HuggingFace.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Multi-Terminal Coding for Gaussian Mixture Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel distributed source coding model which named semantic-aware multi-terminal (MT) source coding is proposed and investigated in the paper, where multiple agents independently encode an imperceptible semantic source, while both semantic and observations are reconstructed within their respective fidelity criteria. We start from a generalized single-letter characterization of sum rate-distortion region of this problem. Furthermore, we propose a mixed MSE-Log loss framework for this model and specifically depict the rate-distortion bounds when sources are Gaussian mixture distributed. For this case, we first present a relative tight outer bound and explore the activeness of semantic and observation distortion constraints, in which we find that good observation reconstruction will not incur too much semantic errors, but not vice versa. Moreover, we provide a practical coding scheme functioning as an achievable regime of inner bound with the performance analysis and simulation results, which verifies the feasibility of the idea "detect and compress" for Gaussian mixture sources. Our results provide theoretical instructions on the fundamental limits and can be used to guide the practical semantic-aware coding designs for multi-user scenarios.</description>

Abstract: A primary objective of the forthcoming sixth generation (6G) of wireless networking is to support demanding applications, while ensuring energy efficiency. Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to control wireless propagation and deliver exceptional quality-ofservice. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a network supported by zero-energy RISs (zeRISs), which harvest energy for their operation and contribute to the realization of PWEs. Specifically, we investigate joint energy-data rate outage probability and the energy efficiency of a zeRIS-assisted communication system by employing three harvest-and-reflect (HaR) methods, i) power splitting, ii) time switching, and iii) element splitting. Furthermore, we consider two zeRIS deployment strategies, namely BS-side zeRIS and UE-side zeRIS. Simulation results validate the provided analysis and examine which HaR method performs better depending on the zeRIS placement. Finally, valuable insights and conclusions for the performance of zeRISassisted wireless networks are drawn from the presented results.</description>

      <title>On the View-and-Channel Aggregation Gain in Integrated Sensing and Edge AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are two key features of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Their natural integration, termed Integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to automate wide-ranging Internet-of-Tings (IoT) applications. To achieve a high sensing accuracy, multi-view features are uploaded to an edge server for aggregation and inference using an AI model. The view aggregation is realized efficiently using over-the-air computing (AirComp), which also aggregates channels to suppress channel noise. At its nascent stage, ISEA still lacks a characterization of the fundamental performance gains from view-and-channel aggregation, which motivates this work. Our framework leverages a well-established distribution model of multi-view sensing data where the classic Gaussian-mixture model is modified by adding sub-spaces matrices to represent individual sensor observation perspectives. Based on the model, we study the End-to-End sensing (inference) uncertainty, a popular measure of inference accuracy, of the said ISEA system by a novel approach involving designing a scaling-tight uncertainty surrogate function, global discriminant gain, distribution of receive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and channel induced discriminant loss. We prove that the E2E sensing uncertainty diminishes at an exponential rate as the number of views/sensors grows, where the rate is proportional to global discriminant gain. Given channel distortion, we further show that the exponential scaling remains with a reduced decay rate related to the channel induced discriminant loss. Furthermore, we benchmark AirComp against equally fast, traditional analog orthogonal access, which reveals a sensing-accuracy crossing point between the schemes, leading to the proposal of adaptive access-mode switching. Last, the insights from our framework are validated by experiments using real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Computation and Communication over MAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study communication over a Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) with two types of transmitters: Digital transmitters hold a message from a discrete set that needs to be communicated to the receiver with vanishing error probability. Analog transmitters hold sequences of analog values, and some functions of these distributed values (but not the values themselves) need to be conveyed to the receiver, subject to a fidelity criterion such as mean squared error (MSE) or a certain maximum error with given confidence. For the case in which the computed function for the analog transmitters is a sum of values in [-1,1], we derive inner and outer bounds for the tradeoff of digital and analog rates of communication under peak and average power constraints for digital transmitters and a peak power constraint for analog transmitters. We then extend the achievability result to a class of functions that includes all linear and some non-linear functions. The practicality of our proposed communication scheme is shown in channel simulations that use a version of the scheme based on low density parity check (LDPC) coding and evaluate the system performance for different block lengths and Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian noise distributions.</description>

Abstract: The Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) is examined within the context of remote monitoring of a Markov source using variable-length stop-feedback (VLSF) coding. Leveraging recent results on the non-asymptotic channel coding rate, we consider sources with small cardinality, where feedback is non-instantaneous as the transmitted information and feedback message have comparable lengths. We focus on the feedback sequence, i.e. the times of feedback transmissions, and derive AoII-optimal and delay-optimal feedback sequences. Our results showcase the impact of the feedback sequence on the AoII, revealing that a lower average delay does not necessarily correspond to a lower average AoII. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest directions for coding scheme design.</description>

      <title>The ESPRIT algorithm under high noise: Optimal error scaling and noisy super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subspace-based signal processing techniques, such as the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, are popular methods for spectral estimation. These algorithms can achieve the so-called super-resolution scaling under low noise conditions, surpassing the well-known Nyquist limit. However, the performance of these algorithms under high-noise conditions is not as well understood. Existing state-of-the-art analysis indicates that ESPRIT and related algorithms can be resilient even for signals where each observation is corrupted by statistically independent, mean-zero noise of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but these analyses only show that the error $\epsilon$ decays at a slow rate $\epsilon=\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ with respect to the cutoff frequency $n$. In this work, we prove that under certain assumptions of bias and high noise, the ESPRIT algorithm can attain a significantly improved error scaling $\epsilon = \mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-3/2})$, exhibiting noisy super-resolution scaling beyond the Nyquist limit. We further establish a theoretical lower bound and show that this scaling is optimal. Our analysis introduces novel matrix perturbation results, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Secure Key Agreement Over a Full Duplex Wireless Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secret key generation (SKG) between authenticated devices is a pivotal task for secure communications. Diffie-Hellman (DH) is de-facto standard but not post-quantum secure. In this paper, we shall invent and analyze a new security primitive that is specifically designed for WPAN. For WPAN, wireless channel-based SKG has been proposed but was not widely deployed due to its critical dependence on the channel's entropy which is uncontrollable. We formulate a different approach: We still exploit channel properties but mainly hinge on the reciprocity of the wireless channel and not on the channel's entropy. The radio advantage comes from the use of full duplex communication. We show that in this situation both legitimate parties can agree on a common secret key even without ever probing the channel at all. At the core is a new bisparse blind deconvolution scheme for which we prove correctness and information-theoretic, i.e. perfect, security. We show that, ultimately, a secret key can be extracted and give a lower bound for the number of secret key bits which is then verified by experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel communication-assisted sensing (CAS) framework that explores the potential coordination gains offered by the integrated sensing and communication technique. The CAS system endows users with beyond-line-of-the-sight sensing capabilities, supported by a dual-functional base station that enables simultaneous sensing and communication. To delve into the system's fundamental limits, we characterize the information-theoretic framework of the CAS system in terms of rate-distortion theory. We reveal the achievable overall distortion between the target's state and the reconstructions at the end-user, referred to as the sensing quality of service, within a special case where the distortion metric is separable for sensing and communication processes. As a case study, we employ a typical application to demonstrate distortion minimization under the ISAC signaling strategy, showcasing the potential of CAS in enhancing sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Attacks Can Enable Positive-Rate Covert Communications of Wireless Hardware Trojans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware Trojans can inflict harm on wireless networks by exploiting the link margins inherent in communication systems. We investigate a setting in which, alongside a legitimate communication link, a hardware Trojan embedded in the legitimate transmitter attempts to establish communication with its intended rogue receiver. To illustrate the susceptibility of wireless networks against pilot attacks, we examine a two-phased scenario. In the channel estimation phase, the Trojan carries out a covert pilot scaling attack to corrupt the channel estimation of the legitimate receiver. Subsequently, in the communication phase, the Trojan exploits the ensuing imperfect channel estimation to covertly communicate with its receiver. By analyzing the corresponding hypothesis tests conducted by the legitimate receiver in both phases, we establish that the pilot scaling attack allows the Trojan to operate in the so-called "linear regime" i.e., covertly and reliably transmitting at a positive rate to the rogue receiver. Our results highlight the vulnerability of the channel estimation process in wireless communication systems against hardware Trojans.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the second-order randomized identification capacity (RID capacity) of the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGNC). On the one hand, we obtain a refined version of Hayashi's theorem to prove the achievability part. On the other, we investigate the relationship between identification and channel resolvability, then we propose a finer quantization method to prove the converse part. Consequently, the second-order RID capacity of the AWGNC has the same form as the second-order transmission capacity. The only difference is that the maximum number of messages in RID scales double exponentially in the blocklength.</description>

      <title>Estimating and using information in inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inverse problems, one attempts to infer spatially variable functions from indirect measurements of a system. To practitioners of inverse problems, the concept of "information" is familiar when discussing key questions such as which parts of the function can be inferred accurately and which cannot. For example, it is generally understood that we can identify system parameters accurately only close to detectors, or along ray paths between sources and detectors, because we have "the most information" for these places. Although referenced in many publications, the "information" that is invoked in such contexts is not a well understood and clearly defined quantity.
  Herein, we present a definition of information density that is based on the variance of coefficients as derived from a Bayesian reformulation of the inverse problem. We then discuss three areas in which this information density can be useful in practical algorithms for the solution of inverse problems, and illustrate the usefulness in one of these areas -- how to choose the discretization mesh for the function to be reconstructed -- using numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the Slepian spatiospectral concentration problem within subdomains of the $d$-dimensional unit ball $\mathbb{B}^d$. The clustering of the eigenvalues near zero and one is a well-known phenomenon. Here, we provide an analytical investigation of this phenomenon for two different notions of bandlimit: (a) multivariate polynomials, with the maximal polynomial degree determining the bandlimit, (b) basis functions that separate into radial and spherical contributions (expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials and spherical harmonics, respectively), with separate maximal degrees for the radial and spherical contributions determining the bandlimit. In particular, we investigate the number of relevant non-zero eigenvalues (the so-called Shannon number) and obtain distinct asymptotic results for both notions of bandlimit, characterized by Jacobi weights $W_0$ and a modification $\widetilde{W_0}$, respectively. The analytic results are illustrated by numerical examples on the 3-d ball.</description>

      <title>On the optimal error exponents for classical and quantum antidistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of antidistinguishability of quantum states has been studied to investigate foundational questions in quantum mechanics. It is also called quantum state elimination, because the goal of such a protocol is to guess which state, among finitely many chosen at random, the system is not prepared in (that is, it can be thought of as the first step in a process of elimination). Antidistinguishability has been used to investigate the reality of quantum states, ruling out $\psi$-epistemic ontological models of quantum mechanics [Pusey et al., Nat. Phys., 8(6):475-478, 2012]. Thus, due to the established importance of antidistinguishability in quantum mechanics, exploring it further is warranted.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of the optimal error exponent -- the rate at which the optimal error probability vanishes to zero asymptotically -- for classical and quantum antidistinguishability. We derive an exact expression for the optimal error exponent in the classical case and show that it is given by the multivariate classical Chernoff divergence. Our work thus provides this divergence with a meaningful operational interpretation as the optimal error exponent for antidistinguishing a set of probability measures. For the quantum case, we provide several bounds on the optimal error exponent: a lower bound given by the best pairwise Chernoff divergence of the states, a single-letter semi-definite programming upper bound, and lower and upper bounds in terms of minimal and maximal multivariate quantum Chernoff divergences. It remains an open problem to obtain an explicit expression for the optimal error exponent for quantum antidistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Mixtures of Gaussians are Privately Learnable with a Polynomial Number of Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating mixtures of Gaussians under the constraint of differential privacy (DP). Our main result is that $\text{poly}(k,d,1/\alpha,1/\varepsilon,\log(1/\delta))$ samples are sufficient to estimate a mixture of $k$ Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$ up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample complexity upper bound for the problem that does not make any structural assumptions on the GMMs.
  To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover (Bun et al., 2021) with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier indicating that, unlike Gaussians, GMMs do not admit a locally small cover (Aden-Ali et al., 2021b).</description>

      <title>Reliable Majority Vote Computation with Complementary Sequences for UAV Waypoint Flight Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a non-coherent over-the-air computation scheme to calculate the majority vote (MV) reliably in fading channels. The proposed approach relies on modulating the amplitude of the elements of complementary sequences based on the sign of the parameters to be aggregated. Since it does not use channel state information at the nodes, it is compatible with time-varying channels. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we employ it in a scenario where an unmanned aerial vehicle is guided by distributed sensors, relying on the MV computed using our proposed scheme. We show that the proposed scheme notably reduces the computation error rate with a longer sequence length in fading channels while maintaining the peak-to-mean-envelope power ratio of the transmitted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals to be less than or equal to 3 dB.</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Hypercomplex Phase Retrieval: Theory and Applications</title>

Abstract: Hypercomplex signal processing (HSP) provides state-of-the-art tools to handle multidimensional signals by harnessing intrinsic correlation of the signal dimensions through Clifford algebra. Recently, the hypercomplex representation of the phase retrieval (PR) problem, wherein a complex-valued signal is estimated through its intensity-only projections, has attracted significant interest. The hypercomplex PR (HPR) arises in many optical imaging and computational sensing applications that usually comprise quaternion and octonion-valued signals. Analogous to the traditional PR, measurements in HPR may involve complex, hypercomplex, Fourier, and other sensing matrices. This set of problems opens opportunities for developing novel HSP tools and algorithms. This article provides a synopsis of the emerging areas and applications of HPR with a focus on optical imaging.</description>

      <title>$L$-systems and the Lov\'asz number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given integers $n &gt; k &gt; 0$, and a set of integers $L \subset [0, k-1]$, an \emph{$L$-system} is a family of sets $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ such that $|F \cap F'| \in L$ for distinct $F, F'\in \mathcal{F}$. $L$-systems correspond to independent sets in a certain generalized Johnson graph $G(n, k, L)$, so that the maximum size of an $L$-system is equivalent to finding the independence number of the graph $G(n, k, L)$. The \emph{Lov\'asz number} $\vartheta(G)$ is a semidefinite programming approximation of the independence number $\alpha$ of a graph $G$.
  In this paper, we determine the leading order term of $\vartheta(G(n, k, L))$ of any generalized Johnson graph with $k$ and $L$ fixed and $n\rightarrow \infty$. As an application of this theorem, we give an explicit construction of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with a large gap between the Lov\'asz number and the Shannon capacity $c(G)$. Specifically, we prove that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, for sufficiently large $n$ there is a generalized Johnson graph $G$ on $n$ vertices which has ratio $\vartheta(G)/c(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which improves on all known constructions. The graph $G$ \textit{a fortiori} also has ratio $\vartheta(G)/\alpha(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which greatly improves on the best known explicit construction.</description>
