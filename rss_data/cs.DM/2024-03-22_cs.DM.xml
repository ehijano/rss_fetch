      <title>A reinforcement learning guided hybrid evolutionary algorithm for the latency location routing problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latency location routing problem integrates the facility location problem and the multi-depot cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem. This problem involves making simultaneous decisions about depot locations and vehicle routes to serve customers while aiming to minimize the sum of waiting (arriving) times for all customers. To address this computationally challenging problem, we propose a reinforcement learning guided hybrid evolutionary algorithm following the framework of the memetic algorithm. The proposed algorithm relies on a diversity-enhanced multi-parent edge assembly crossover to build promising offspring and a reinforcement learning guided variable neighborhood descent to determine the exploration order of multiple neighborhoods. Additionally, strategic oscillation is used to achieve a balanced exploration of both feasible and infeasible solutions. The competitiveness of the algorithm against state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated by experimental results on the three sets of 76 popular instances, including 51 improved best solutions (new upper bounds) for the 59 instances with unknown optima and equal best results for the remaining instances. We also conduct additional experiments to shed light on the key components of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Rescue Craft Allocation in Tidal Waters of the North and Baltic Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to improve the average response time for naval accidents in the North and Baltic Sea. To do this we optimize the strategic distribution of the vessel fleet used by the Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Rettung Schiffbr\"uchiger (German Maritime Search and Rescue Service) (DGzRS) across several home stations. Based on these locations, in case of an incoming distress call the vessel with the lowest response time is dispatched. A particularity of the region considered is the fact that due to low tide, at predictable times some vessels and stations are not operational. In our work, we build a corresponding mathematical model for the allocation of rescue crafts to multiple stations. Thereafter, we show that the problem is NP-hard. Next, we provide an Integer Programming (IP) formulation. Finally, we propose several methods of simplifying the model and do a case study to compare their effectiveness. For this, we generate test instances based on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Polytopes with Bounded Integral Slack Matrices Have Sub-Exponential Extension Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any bounded integral function $f : A \times B \mapsto \{0,1, \dots, \Delta\}$ with rank $r$ has deterministic communication complexity $\Delta^{O(\Delta)} \cdot \sqrt{r} \cdot \log r$, where the rank of $f$ is defined to be the rank of the $A \times B$ matrix whose entries are the function values. As a corollary, we show that any $n$-dimensional polytope that admits a slack matrix with entries from $\{0,1,\dots,\Delta\}$ has extension complexity at most $\exp(\Delta^{O(\Delta)} \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot \log n)$.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Temporal Vertex Cover in Small-Degree Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs naturally model graphs whose underlying topology changes over time. Recently, the problems TEMPORAL VERTEX COVER (or TVC) and SLIDING-WINDOW TEMPORAL VERTEX COVER(or $\Delta$-TVC for time-windows of a fixed-length $\Delta$) have been established as natural extensions of the classic problem VERTEX COVER on static graphs with connections to areas such as surveillance in sensor networks. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the complexity of TVC and $\Delta$-TVC on sparse graphs. Our main result shows that for every $\Delta\geq 2$, $\Delta$-TVC is NP-hard even when the underlying topology is described by a path or a cycle. This resolves an open problem from literature and shows a surprising contrast between $\Delta$-TVC and TVC for which we provide a polynomial-time algorithm in the same setting. To circumvent this hardness, we present a number of exact and approximation algorithms for temporal graphs whose underlying topologies are given by a path, that have bounded vertex degree in every time step, or that admit a small-sized temporal vertex cover.</description>

      <title>On the Congruency-Constrained Matroid Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a matroid where all elements are labeled with an element in $\mathbb{Z}$. We are interested in finding a base where the sum of the labels is congruent to $g \pmod m$. We show that this problem can be solved in $\tilde{O}(2^{4m} n r^{5/6})$ time for a matroid with $n$ elements and rank $r$, when $m$ is either the product of two primes or a prime power. The algorithm can be generalized to all moduli and, in fact, to all abelian groups if a classic additive combinatorics conjecture by Schrijver and Seymour holds true. We also discuss the optimization version of the problem.</description>

      <title>An Improved Lower Bound on the Number of Pseudoline Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrangements of pseudolines are classic objects in discrete and computational geometry. They have been studied with increasing intensity since their introduction almost 100 years ago. The study of the number $B_n$ of non-isomorphic simple arrangements of $n$ pseudolines goes back to Goodman and Pollack, Knuth, and others. It is known that $B_n$ is in the order of $2^{\Theta(n^2)}$ and finding asymptotic bounds on $b_n = \frac{\log_2(B_n)}{n^2}$ remains a challenging task. In 2011, Felsner and Valtr showed that $0.1887 \leq b_n \le 0.6571$ for sufficiently large $n$. The upper bound remains untouched but in 2020 Dumitrescu and Mandal improved the lower bound constant to $0.2083$. Their approach utilizes the known values of $B_n$ for up to $n=12$.
  We tackle the lower bound by utilizing dynamic programming and the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot lemma. Our new bound is $b_n \geq 0.2721$ for sufficiently large $n$. The result is based on a delicate interplay of theoretical ideas and computer assistance.</description>

      <title>The q-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any positive integer $q\geq 2$ and any real number $\delta\in(0,1)$, let $\alpha_q(n,\delta n)$ denote the maximum size of a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ with minimum Hamming distance at least $\delta n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_q=\{0,1,\dotsc,q-1\}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. The asymptotic rate function is defined by $ R_q(\delta) = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log_q\alpha_q(n,\delta n).$ The famous $q$-ary asymptotic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, obtained in the 1950s, states that \[ R_q(\delta) \geq 1 - \delta\log_q(q-1)-\delta\log_q\frac{1}{\delta}-(1-\delta)\log_q\frac{1}{1-\delta} \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q) \] for all positive integers $q\geq 2$ and $0&lt;\delta&lt;1-q^{-1}$. In the case that $q$ is an even power of a prime with $q\geq 49$, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound was firstly improved by using algebraic geometry codes in the works of Tsfasman, Vladut, and Zink and of Ihara in the 1980s. These algebraic geometry codes have been modified to improve the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ at a specific tangent point $\delta=\delta_0\in (0,1)$ of the curve $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ for each given integer $q\geq 46$. However, the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ at $\delta=1/2$, i.e., $R_\mathrm{GV}(1/2,q)$, remains the largest known lower bound of $R_q(1/2)$ for infinitely many positive integers $q$ which is a generic prime and which is a generic non-prime-power integer. In this paper, by using codes from geometry of numbers introduced by Lenstra in the 1980s, we prove that the $q$-ary Gilbert-Varshamov bound $R_\mathrm{GV}(\delta,q)$ with $\delta\in(0,1)$ can be improved for all but finitely many positive integers $q$. It is shown that the growth defined by $\eta(\delta)= \liminf_{q\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\log q}\log[1-\delta-R_q(\delta)]^{-1}$ for every $\delta\in(0,1)$ has actually a nontrivial lower bound.</description>
