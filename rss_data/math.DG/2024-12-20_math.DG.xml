      <title>Rigidity of the hyperbolic marked energy spectrum and entropy for $k$-surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labourie raised the question of determining the possible asymptotics for the growth rate of compact $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, in negatively curved $3$-manifolds, indicating the possibility of a theory of thermodynamical formalism for this class of surfaces. Motivated by this question and by analogous results for the geodesic flow, we prove a number of results concerning the asymptotic behavior of high energy $k$-surfaces, especially in relation to the curvature of the ambient space.
  First, we determine a rigid upper bound for the growth rate of quasi-Fuchsian $k$-surfaces, counted according to energy, and with asymptotically round limit set, subject to a lower bound on the sectional curvature of the ambient space. We also study the marked energy spectrum for $k$-surfaces, proving a number of domination and rigidity theorems in this context. Finally, we show that the marked area and energy spectra for $k$-surfaces in $3$-dimensional manifolds of negative curvature are asymptotic if and only if the sectional curvature is constant.</description>

      <title>Harmonic metrics of generically regular nilpotent Higgs bundles over non-compact surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rank $n$ Higgs bundle $(E,\theta)$ is called generically regular nilpotent if $\theta^n=0$ but $\theta^{n-1}\neq 0$. We show that for a generically regular nilpotent Higgs bundle, if it admits a harmonic metric, then its graded Higgs bundle admits a unique maximal harmonic metric. The proof relies on a generalization of Kalka-Yang's theorem for prescribed curvature equation over a non-compact hyperbolic surface to a coupled system. As an application, we show that the branched set of a branched minimal disk in $\mathbb{H}^3$ has to be the critical set of some holomorphic self-map of $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Liu's method, we prove a new Witten rigidity theorem of elliptic genus of twisted Dirac operators in even dimensional spin manifolds under the circle action. Combined with the Han-Yu's method, we prove the Witten rigidity theorems of elliptic genus of twisted Toplitz operators of odd-dimensional spin manifolds under the circle action. Moreover, we have obtained several similar Witten rigidity theorems of elliptic genus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study geometric and analytical features of complete noncompact $\rho$-Einstein solitons, which are self-similar solutions of the Ricci-Bourguignon flow. We study the spectrum of the drifted Laplacian operator for complete gradient shrinking $\rho$-Einstein soliton. Moreover, similar to classical results due to Calabi-Yau and Bishop for complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, we prove new volume growth estimates for geodesic balls of complete noncompact $\rho$-Einstein solitons. In particular, the rigidity case is discussed. In addition, we establish weighted volume growth estimates for geodesic balls of such manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relationships between asymptotic geometry of submanifolds in the hyperbolic space and their regularity properties near the ideal boundary, revisiting some of the related results in the literature. In particular, we discuss hypotheses when minimal submanifolds meet the ideal boundary orthogonally, and compute the essential spectrum of the Laplace operator on submanifolds that are asymptotically close to minimal submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Equivariant cohomological rigidity for four-dimensional Hamiltonian $\mathbf{S^1}$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For manifolds equipped with group actions, we have the following natural question: To what extent does the equivariant cohomology determine the equivariant diffeotype? We resolve this question for Hamiltonian circle actions on compact, connected symplectic four-manifolds. They are equivariantly diffeomorphic if and only if their equivariant cohomology rings are isomorphic as algebras over the equivariant cohomology of a point. In fact, we prove a stronger claim: each isomorphism between their equivariant cohomology rings is induced by an equivariant diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>On material-uniform elastic bodies with disclinations and their homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we define material-uniform hyperelastic bodies (in the sense of Noll) containing discrete disclinations and dislocations, and study their properties. We show in a rigorous way that the size of a disclination is limited by the symmetries of the constitutive relation; in particular, if the symmetry group of the body is discrete, it cannot admit arbitrarily small, yet non-zero, disclinations. We then discuss the application of these observations to the derivations of models of bodies with continuously-distributed defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms with conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon transforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray transforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null bicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that, under certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the normal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several Fourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points. These results were first proved for geodesic X-ray transforms by Holman and Uhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494).</description>

      <title>Smoothing a measure on a Riemann surface using Ricci flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.14686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and solve the existence problem for Ricci flow on a Riemann surface with initial data given by a Radon measure as volume measure. The theory leads us to a large class of new examples of nongradient expanding Ricci solitons, including the first example of a nongradient Kaehler Ricci soliton. It also settles the question of whether a smooth flow for positive time that attains smooth initial data in a distance metric sense must be smooth down to the initial time. We disprove this by giving an example of a complete Ricci flow starting with the Euclidean plane that is not the static solution.</description>

      <title>Computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a general procedure for computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we explain the connection between the Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas of Albin and Chang-Qing-Yang for the renormalized volume, and explicitly identify a scalar conformal invariant in the latter formula. Our approach constructs scalar conformal invariants of weight $-n$ on $n$-manifolds, $n \geq 8$, that are natural divergences; these imply that the scalar invariant in the Chang-Qing-Yang formula is not unique in dimension $n \geq 8$. Our procedure also produces explicit conformally invariant Gauss--Bonnet-type formulas for compact Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide a quantitative global Poincar\'e inequality for one forms on a closed Riemannian four manifold, in terms of an upper bound on the diameter, a positive lower bound on the volume, and a two-sided bound on Ricci curvature. This seems to be the first non-trivial result giving such an inequality without any higher curvature assumptions. The proof is based on a Hodge theoretic result on orbifolds, a comparison for fundamental groups, and a spectral convergence with respect to Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, via a degeneration result to orbifolds by Anderson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Painlev\'e theorem for bounded quasiregular curves in Euclidean spaces extending removability results for quasiregular mappings due to Iwaniec and Martin. The theorem is proved by extending a fundamental inequality for volume forms to calibrations and proving a Caccioppoli inequality for quasiregular curves.
  We also establish a qualitatively sharp removability theorem for quasiregular curves whose target is a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above and an injectivity radius lower bound. As an application, we extend a theorem of Bonk and Heinonen for quasiregular mappings to the setting of quasiregular curves: every non-constant quasiregular $\omega$-curve from $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $( N, \omega )$, where the bounded cohomology class of $\omega$ is in the bounded K\"unneth ideal, has infinite energy.</description>

      <title>Principal bundles in the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and examine the notion of principal $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-bundles, i.e., principal bundles in the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds. The latter are higher graded extensions of supermanifolds in which a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-grading replaces $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading. These extensions have opened up new areas of research of great interest in both physics and mathematics. In principle, the geometry of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds is essentially different than that of supermanifolds, as for $n&gt;1$ we have formal variables of even parity, so local smooth functions are formal power series. On the other hand, a full version of differential calculus is still valid. We show in this paper that the fundamental properties of classical principal bundles can be generalised to the setting of this `higher graded' geometry, with properly defined frame bundles of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-vector bundles as canonical examples. However, formulating these concepts and proving these results relies on many technical upshots established in earlier papers. A comprehensive introduction to $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds is therefore included together with basic examples.</description>

      <title>On microlocalisation and the construction of Feynman Propagators for normally hyperbolic operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article gives global microlocalisation constructions for normally hyperbolic operators on a vector bundle over a globally hyperbolic spacetime in geometric terms. As an application, this is used to generalise the Duistermaat-H\"{o}rmander construction of Feynman propagators, therefore incorporating the most important non-scalar geometric operators. It is shown that for normally hyperbolic operators that are selfadjoint with respect to a hermitian bundle metric, the Feynman propagators can be constructed to satisfy a positivity property that reflects the existence of Hadamard states in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. We also give a more direct construction of the Feynman propagators for Dirac-type operators on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Even though the natural bundle metric on spinors is not positive-definite, in this case, we can give a direct microlocal construction of a Feynman propagator that satisfies positivity.</description>

      <title>A geometric take on Kostant's Convexity Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a compact Lie group $G$ and an orthogonal $G$-representation $V$, we give a purely metric criterion for a closed subset of the orbit space $V/G$ to have convex pre-image in $V$. In fact, this also holds with the natural quotient map $V\to V/G$ replaced with an arbitrary submetry $V\to X$.
  In this context, we introduce a notion of "fat section" which generalizes polar representations, representations of non-trivial copolarity, and isoparametric foliations.
  We show that Kostant's Convexity Theorem partially generalizes from polar representations to submetries with a fat section, and give examples illustrating that it does not fully generalize to this situation.</description>

      <title>Runge and Mergelyan theorems on families of open Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the Oka theory for maps from families of open Riemann surfaces to any Oka manifold. Along the way, we prove Runge and Mergelyan approximation theorems and Weierstrass interpolation theorem for families of complex structures on a smooth open surface, with continuous or smooth dependence of the data and the approximating functions on the complex structure. This implies global solvability of the $\overline\partial$-equation on such families. We also obtain an Oka principle for complex line bundles on families of open Riemann surfaces, and we show that the canonical bundles of open Riemann surfaces are holomorphically trivial in families. We include applications to directed holomorphic immersions and conformal minimal immersions.</description>
