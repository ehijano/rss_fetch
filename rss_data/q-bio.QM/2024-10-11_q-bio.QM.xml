      <title>Precision Cancer Classification and Biomarker Identification from mRNA Gene Expression via Dimensionality Reduction and Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene expression analysis is a critical method for cancer classification, enabling precise diagnoses through the identification of unique molecular signatures associated with various tumors. Identifying cancer-specific genes from gene expression values enables a more tailored and personalized treatment approach. However, the high dimensionality of mRNA gene expression data poses challenges for analysis and data extraction. This research presents a comprehensive pipeline designed to accurately identify 33 distinct cancer types and their corresponding gene sets. It incorporates a combination of normalization and feature selection techniques to reduce dataset dimensionality effectively while ensuring high performance. Notably, our pipeline successfully identifies a substantial number of cancer-specific genes using a reduced feature set of just 500, in contrast to using the full dataset comprising 19,238 features. By employing an ensemble approach that combines three top-performing classifiers, a classification accuracy of 96.61% was achieved. Furthermore, we leverage Explainable AI to elucidate the biological significance of the identified cancer-specific genes, employing Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning to learn ecosystems from limited data -- a meta-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing data-driven approaches to ecological systems for tasks such as state estimation and prediction is the paucity of the observational or measurement data. For example, modern machine-learning techniques such as deep learning or reservoir computing typically require a large quantity of data. Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the ``dynamical climate'' of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark population models in ecology, namely the Hastings-Powell model, a three-species food chain, and the Lotka-Volterra system, are used to demonstrate the performance of the meta-learning based prediction framework. In all cases, enhanced accuracy and robustness are achieved using five to seven times less training data as compared with the corresponding machine-learning method trained solely from the ecosystem data. A number of issues affecting the prediction performance are addressed.</description>

      <title>Inferring biological processes with intrinsic noise from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring dynamical models from data continues to be a significant challenge in computational biology, especially given the stochastic nature of many biological processes. We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ODE inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Optimized Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting Using Ziv-Zakai Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) has emerged as a promising quantitative imaging technique within the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), offers comprehensive insights into tissue properties by simultaneously acquiring multiple tissue parameter maps in a single acquisition. Sequence optimization is crucial for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRF. In this work, a novel framework for MRF sequence optimization is proposed based on the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB). Unlike the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB), which aims to enhance the quality of a single fingerprint signal with deterministic parameters, ZZB provides insights into evaluating the minimum mismatch probability for pairs of fingerprint signals within the specified parameter range in MRF. Specifically, the explicit ZZB is derived to establish a lower bound for the discrimination error in the fingerprint signal matching process within MRF. This bound illuminates the intrinsic limitations of MRF sequences, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of existing sequence performance. Subsequently, an optimal experiment design problem based on ZZB was formulated to ascertain the optimal scheme of acquisition parameters, maximizing discrimination power of MRF between different tissue types. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the optimized ZZB scheme outperforms both the conventional and CRB schemes in terms of the reconstruction accuracy of multiple parameter maps.</description>
