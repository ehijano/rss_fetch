      <title>Scalable testing of quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard method for benchmarking quantum error-correction is randomized fault-injection testing. The state-of-the-art tool \stim is efficient for error correction implementations with distances of up to 10, but scales poorly to larger distances for low physical error rates. In this paper, we present a scalable approach that combines stratified fault injection with extrapolation. Our insight is that some of the fault space can be sampled efficiently, after which extrapolation is sufficient to complete the testing task. As a result, our tool scales to distance 17 for a physical error rate of 0.0005 with a two-hour time budget on a desktop. For this case, it estimated a logical error rate of $1.51 \times 10^{-11}$ with high confidence.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Parameter Estimation with Large Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information of a quantum state with respect to a certain parameter quantifies the sensitivity of the quantum state to changes in that parameter. Maximizing the quantum Fisher information is essential for achieving the optimal estimation precision of quantum sensors. A typical quantum sensor involves a qubit(e.g. a spin-1/2) probe undergoing an unknown rotation, here the unknown rotation angle is the parameter to be estimated. A well known limitation is that if the rotation axis is unknown, the maximal quantum Fisher information is impossible to attain. This limitation has been lifted recently by leveraging entanglement between the probe qubit and an ancilla qubit. Namely, through measurement of the ancilla after the axis is revealed, one can prepare the probe that is optimal for any unknown rotation axis. This proposal, however, works only for a spin-1/2. Considering large spin probes can achieve a larger quantum Fisher information, offering enhanced metrological advantage, we here utilize the entanglement between a large spin probe and an ancilla to achieve optimal quantum Fisher information for estimating the rotation angle, without prior knowledge of the rotation axis. Different from the previous spin-1/2 case, achieving the optimal precision with large spins generally requires post-selection, resulting in a success probability dependent on the dimension of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we extend the encoding state from the maximally entangled case to general entangled states, showing that optimal metrology can still be achieved with a certain success probability.</description>

      <title>Instance-optimal high-precision shadow tomography with few-copy measurements: A metrological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime under realistic measurement constraints. Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_i\rho)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $\epsilon$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $\rho$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $\epsilon$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.
  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$, where $\Gamma_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i O_i$ with $\|\alpha\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $\Theta(\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/\epsilon^2)$. We then show $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = \Gamma_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $\Omega(1/c)$.
  Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.</description>

      <title>Efficient time-evolution of matrix product states using average Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the long-standing, highly non-trivial challenges in condensed matter physics and quantum information due to the exponentially growing size of the system's Hilbert space. To date, tensor networks have been an essential tool for studying such quantum systems, owing to their ability to efficiently capture the entanglement properties of the systems they represent. One of the well-known tensor network architectures, namely matrix product states (MPS), is the standard method for simulating one-dimensional QMBS. Here, we propose a simple, yet efficient, method to augment the already available MPS algorithms to simulate the dynamics of time-dependent Hamiltonians with better accuracy and a faster convergence rate, giving a second-order convergence compared to the first-order convergence of the standard method. We apply our proposed method to simulate the dynamics of a chain of single spins associated with nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamonds, which has potential applications for practical and scalable quantum technologies, and find that our method improves the average error for a system of few NV centers by a factor of about 1000 for moderate step sizes. Our work paves the way for efficient simulation of QMBS under the influence of time-dependent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Topological frustration and quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although in general boundary conditions do not affect the bulk properties of a system, some of them are special and defy such expectation. This is the case, for instance, of those inducing geometrical frustration in a classical magnet. Recently, the study of such settings in quantum systems (dubbed topological frustration) has uncovered peculiar features, interesting both from a fundamental and technological point of view. In this work, we present and discuss the behavior of several quantum resources in presence of TF, namely the (disconnected) entanglement entropy and the non-stabilizerness Renyi entropy. We will show that, compared to their non-frustrated counterparts, TF adds a distinct contribution to these resources, due to a stable, delocalized, topological excitation. Remarkably, this contribution can be calculated analytically, due to its similarities with that of a W-state.</description>

      <title>Tighter Asymptotic Key Rates for Intensity-Correlated Decoy-State QKD via Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoy-state QKD with phase-randomized weak coherent pulses is typically analyzed assuming independent, precisely prepared intensities. Real sources, however, can exhibit correlated intensity drift across rounds, potentially leaking intensity information and breaking the standard decoy-state reduction to linear programs. Cauchy--Schwarz (CS) constraints can restore security by coupling $n$-photon yields across intensities, but they introduce nonlinear square-root constraints that are commonly handled via outer linearisation around channel-model-based reference points. We propose a reproducible alternative: first solve the full CS-constrained parameter-estimation problems using the interior-point nonlinear solver IPOPT, then use the resulting candidate solution as the linearisation point for the outer optimisation that certifies a valid lower bound on the asymptotic key rate. Simulations for both coarse-grained model-independent correlations and fine-grained truncated-Gaussian models show consistently tighter key-rate bounds than canonical reference points, and in some cases allow certifying optimality when both optimisation stages coincide.</description>

      <title>Taming multiparty entanglement at measurement-induced phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) give rise to novel dynamical states of quantum matter realized by balancing unitary evolution and measurements. We present large-scale numerical simulations of a trapped-ion native MIPT, argued to belong to the universality class described by the Haar non-unitary conformal field theory. First, through a finite-size analysis we obtained the critical measurement rate, and correlation length exponent, which falls close to the percolation value. Second, by leveraging a monotone computable via semi-definite programming, we uncover robust algebraic decay of genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) versus separation for 2, 3, and 4 parties. The corresponding critical exponents are lower-bounded by those of the multiparty mutual information, which we determine up to 4 parties, and conjecture to be (k+2) for k parties. Additionally, we derive lower bounds for both GME and multiparty mutual information.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Error Mitigation: Global and Local ZNE encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Errors are the primary bottleneck preventing practical quantum computing. This challenge is exacerbated in the distributed quantum computing regime, where quantum networks introduce additional communication-induced noise. While error mitigation techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) have proven effective for standalone quantum processors, their behavior in distributed architectures is not yet well understood. We investigate ZNE in this setting by comparing Global optimization (ZNE is applied prior to circuit partitioning), against Local optimization (ZNE is applied independently to each sub-circuit). Partitioning is performed on a monolithic circuit, which is then transformed into a distributed implementation by inserting noisy teleportation-based communication primitives between sub-circuits. We evaluate both approaches across varying numbers of quantum processing units (QPUs) and under heterogeneous local and network noise conditions. Our results demonstrate that Global ZNE exhibits superior scalability, achieving error reductions of up to $48\%$ across six QPUs. Moreover, we observe counterintuitive noise behavior, where increasing the number of QPUs improves mitigation effectiveness despite higher communication overhead. These findings highlight fundamental trade-offs in distributed quantum error mitigation and raise new questions regarding the interplay between circuit structure, partitioning strategies, and network noise.</description>

      <title>QuantumGS: Quantum Encoding Framework for Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled real-time rendering of complex scenes. However, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmonics, which often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency view-dependent effects such as sharp reflections and transparency. While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data. By replacing classical color-modulating networks with quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher expressivity and better generalization.

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution with Imperfections: Recent Advances in Security Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to classical cryptography, where the security of encoded messages typically relies on the inability of standard algorithms to overcome computational complexity assumptions, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can enable two spatially separated parties to establish an information-theoretically secure encryption, provided that the QKD protocol is underpinned by a security proof. In the last decades, security proofs robust against a wide range of eavesdropping strategies have established the theoretical soundness of several QKD protocols. However, most proofs are based on idealized models of the physical systems involved in such protocols and often include assumptions that are not satisfied in practical implementations. This mismatch creates a gap between theoretical security guarantees and actual experimental realizations, making QKD protocols vulnerable to attacks. To ensure the security of real-world QKD systems, it is therefore essential to account for imperfections in security analyses. In this article, we present an overview of recent analytical and numerical developments in QKD security proofs, which provide a versatile approach for incorporating imperfections and re-establishing the security of quantum communication protocols under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning fermionic linear optics with Heisenberg scaling and physical operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of learning fermionic linear optics (FLO), also known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries. Given black-box query access to an unknown FLO, previous proposals required $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^5 / \varepsilon^2)$ queries, where $n$ is the system size and $\varepsilon$ is the error in diamond distance. These algorithms also use unphysical operations (i.e., violating fermionic superselection rules) and/or $n$ auxiliary modes to prepare Choi states of the FLO. In this work, we establish efficient and experimentally friendly protocols that obey superselection, use minimal ancilla (at most $1$ extra mode), and exhibit improved dependence on both parameters $n$ and $\varepsilon$. For arbitrary (active) FLOs this algorithm makes at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4 / \varepsilon)$ queries, while for number-conserving (passive) FLOs we show that $\mathcal{O}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ queries suffice. The complexity of the active case can be further reduced to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^3 / \varepsilon)$ at the cost of using $n$ ancilla. This marks the first FLO learning algorithm that attains Heisenberg scaling in precision. As a side result, we also demonstrate an improved copy complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n \eta^2 / \varepsilon^2)$ for time-efficient state tomography of $\eta$-particle Slater determinants in $\varepsilon$ trace distance, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian representations based on the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy provide rigorous lower bounds on ground-state energies and facilitate the design of efficient classical and quantum simulation algorithms. This work presents a unified framework connecting SOS decompositions with variational two-particle reduced density matrix (v2RDM) theory. We demonstrate that the ``weighted'' SOS ansatz naturally recovers the dual of the v2RDM program, enabling the strict enforcement of symmetry constraints such as particle number and spin. We provide explicit SOS constructions for the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonians, ranging from spin-free approximations to full rank-2 expansions. We also highlight theoretical connections to block-invariant symmetry shifts. Numerical benchmarks on molecular systems and Iron-Sulfur clusters validate these near frustration-free representations, demonstrating their utility in improving spectral gap amplification and reducing block encoding costs in quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Photonic entanglement enhanced multidimensional spectroscopy for probing exciton correlations: theory and applications to photosynthetic aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear spectroscopic techniques using entangled photon pairs provide an opportunity to exploit non-classical correlations encoded in two-photon wavefunctions to manipulate two-exciton wavefunctions. We propose an entangled photon pair-enhanced multidimensional spectroscopic technique which is sensitive to exciton-exciton interactions and correlations at the ultrafast timescale. Simulations for a dissipative photosynthetic aggregate reveal the superior ability of entangled photon pairs, compared to both transform-limited and frequency-chirped laser pulses, to manipulate excited-state absorption pathways. The corresponding spectral features in the two-dimensional spectrogram are interpreted in terms of one- and two-exciton resonances. The signal scales linearly with the incoming intensity of the photon sources. It is argued that classifying these resonances using entangled photon source at the perturbative limit allow for probing exciton correlations at the natural energy scale. These insights can be used to explore multi-exciton dynamics using multiphoton entanglement.</description>

Abstract: QASMTrans is a lightweight, high-performance, C++-based quantum compiler that bridges abstract quantum algorithms to device-level control and is designed for just-in-time (JIT) deployment on QPU testbeds with tightly integrated FPGAs or CPUs. We focus on achieving fast transpilation times on circuits of interest, we find more than 100x faster compilation than Qiskit in some circuits with similar circuit quality, enabling transpilation of large, high-depth circuits in seconds. Unlike existing tools, QASMTrans offers end-to-end device-pulse compilation and direct quantum control integration with QICK, closing the gap between logical circuits and hardware control enabling closed-loop optimization. QASMTrans supports latency-aware Application-tailored Gate Sets (AGS) at the pulse level, identifying high-impact gate sequences on the circuit critical path and synthesizing optimized pulse schedules using pre-defined robust circuit ansatz. Validated through integrated QuTiP pulse-level simulation, this is found to significantly reduce execution latency and can improve final-state fidelity by up to 12% in some tested circuits. QASMTrans further implements device-aware, noise-adaptive transpilation that uses device calibration data for circuit placement on high-quality qubits and can focus on the circuit critical path to reduce transpilation-pass time while maintaining comparable fidelity. Additionally, it introduces circuit space sharing via calibration-aware device partitioning, enabling concurrent execution of multiple circuits or shots on a single QPU. Moreover, QASMTrans is entirely self-contained and has no external library dependencies, making it easy for practical deployment. By combining fast compilation, pulse-level control, and noise-aware optimization, QASMTrans enables real-time adaptive algorithms such as ADAPT-VQE and ADAPT-QAOA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces and characterizes quantum sequential circuits (QSCs) as a hardware-oriented paradigm for quantum computing, built upon a novel foundational element termed the quantum transistor. Unlike conventional qubit-based architectures, QSCs employ symmetry-protected topological junctions where quantum gates are encoded as Choi states via channel-state duality and activated through bulk measurements, utilizing ebits to realize the functional analog of feedback loops in classical sequential circuits. This framework establishes a universal model for quantum computation that inherently incorporates memory and temporal sequencing, complementing existing combinational quantum circuit model. Our work advances the conceptual bridge towards a quantum von Neumann architecture, underscoring the potential of hybrid and modular design principles for the development of large-scale, integrated quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Broadband Population Transfer Based on Suture Adiabatic Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity coherent population transfer plays a vital role in the realization of quantum memories. However, population transfer with high performance across a broad frequency range is still challenging due to the finite Rabi coupling strength limited by laser powers. Here we propose a novel population-transfer scheme by suturing adiabatic control pulses with each pulse covering certain frequency interval, which are connected in a way that neighboring adiabatic pulses have opposite chirping directions. Taking the widely utilized hyperbolic-square-hyperbolic pulse as an example, we demonstrate that rapid and robust population transfer can be achieved. The transfer bandwidth scales linearly with the number of suture pulses while maintaining high fidelity, even at the suture points where adiabaticity breaks down. Crucially, these pulses can be realized by a single laser by means of temporal multiplexing. For a given bandwidth, this strategy substantially reduces the operational time which is necessary for on demand read-out and suppressing decoherence effects. Our scheme enables a dramatic increase in multimode storage capacity and paves the way for realizing practical quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Practical continuous-variable quantum key distribution using dynamic digital signal processing: security proof and experimental demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital signal processing technology has paved the way for the realization of high-speed continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems. However, existing security proofs are limited to static digital signal processing algorithms, while practical systems rely on dynamic multiple-input multiple-output algorithms to compensate for time-varying channel impairments. Our analysis reveals that the conventional dynamic algorithm, due to its non-unitary nature, systematically underestimates the excess noise, which in turn leads to security issues and the generation of insecure keys. To close this gap, we propose a secure algorithm model, mapping the dynamic algorithm to an equivalent physical optical model whose security can be rigorously assessed. Simulations illustrate the algorithm's non-unitary property and provide a quantitative analysis of the excess noise underestimation caused by the conventional algorithm. We further experimentally validate the necessity of the proposed modeling for dynamic digital signal processing, achieving a secret key rate of 14.4 Mbps based on estimated excess noise of 0.07 shot noise unit; whereas the conventional algorithm would have dangerously overestimated the key rate to 28.2 Mbps with noise of 0.008 shot noise unit. This work provides the essential security framework for dynamic digital signal processing, overcoming a critical impediment for the development of high-performance continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Negativity in the Quantum-to-Classical Transition of Kerr Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the quantum-to-classical transition of the single-mode Kerr nonlinear dynamics in the presence of loss. We establish three time scales that govern the dynamics, each with distinct characteristics. For times short compared to the Ehrenfest time, the evolution is classical, characterized by Gaussian dynamics. For sufficiently long times, as we increase the initial photon number, unitary Kerr evolution would generate macroscopic superpositions of coherent states (so-called kitten states), but this is severely restricted in the presence of small photon loss so that expectation values of observables coincide with their classical values. The intermediate time scale, however, shows resilient quantum behavior in the macroscopic limit. We show that in the mean-field non-Gaussian regime, the Kerr Hamiltonian (with small photon loss) generates a significant amount of Wigner-negativity, and classical flow is recovered only if the loss rate grows with system size. Our results broaden the usual understanding of quantum-to-classical transitions and demonstrate the potential for creating robust nonclassical resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing in the presence of loss.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Classical Spin Hamiltonians Based on Matrix Product Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tensor-network (TN) approach for solving classical optimization problems that is inspired by spectral filtering and sampling on quantum states. We first shift and scale an Ising Hamiltonian of the cost function so that all eigenvalues become non-negative and the ground states correspond to the the largest eigenvalues, which are then amplified by power iteration. We represent the transformed Hamiltonian as a matrix product operator (MPO) and form an immense power of this object via truncated MPO-MPO contractions, embedding the resulting operator into a matrix product state for sampling in the computational basis. In contrast to the density-matrix renormalization group, our approach provides a straightforward route to systematic improvement by increasing the bond dimension and is better at avoiding local minima. We also study the performance of this power method in the context of a higher-order Ising Hamiltonian on a heavy-hexagonal lattice, making a comparison with simulated annealing. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms for solving optimization problems and provide a baseline for assessing and developing quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum scattering in helically twisted geometries: Coulomb-like interaction and Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of a charged quantum particle in a helically twisted background that induces an effective Coulomb-like interaction, in the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux. Starting from the nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger equation in the twisted metric, we derive the radial equation and show that, after including the AB potential, it can be mapped onto the same Kummer-type differential equation that governs the planar $2D$ Coulomb $+$ AB problem, with a geometry-induced Coulomb strength and the azimuthal quantum number shifted as $m\to m-\lambda$. We construct the exact scattering solutions, obtain closed expressions for the partial-wave $S$ matrix and phase shifts, and derive the corresponding scattering amplitude, differential cross section, and total cross section. We also show that the pole structure of the $S$ matrix is consistent with the bound-state quantization previously obtained for the helically twisted Coulomb-like problem.</description>

      <title>Gradient Analysis of Barren Plateau in Parameterized Quantum Circuits with multi-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the Barren Plateau phenomenon poses a significant challenge to quantum machine learning. While most Barren Plateau analyses focus on single-qubit rotation gates, the gradient behavior of Parameterized Quantum Circuits built from multi-qubit gates remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a general theoretical framework for analyzing the gradient properties of Parameterized Quantum Circuits with multi-qubit gates. Our method generalizes the direct computation framework, bypassing the Haar random assumption on parameters and enabling the calculation of the gradient expectation and variance. We apply this framework to single-layer and deep-layer circuits, deriving analytical results that quantify how gradient variance is co-determined by the size of the multi-qubit gate and the number of qubits, layers, and effective parameters. Numerical simulations validate our findings. Our study provides a refined framework for analyzing and optimizing Parameterized Quantum Circuits with complex multi-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology via alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology harnesses quantum entanglement to improve measurement precision beyond standard quantum limit. Although nonlinear interaction is essential for generating entanglement, during signal accumulation, it becomes detrimental and therefore must be suppressed. To address this challenge, we propose an alternating in-phase and quadrature modulation (AIQM) scheme, designed to operate under a fixed nonlinear interaction. During signal accumulation, our time-interleaved approach sequentially applies the in-phase and quadrature driving fields, thereby eliminating the effects of nonlinear interaction on signal accumulation. Our AIQM scheme achieves better metrological performance than conventional schemes, particularly under strong nonlinear interaction and prolonged signal accumulation, with pronounced robustness against parameter variations. By selectively eliminating and utilizing nonlinear interactions via AIQM, our work enables high-precision and high-accuracy entanglement-enhanced sensing without the need for active control of the nonlinear interaction.</description>

      <title>High-order dynamical decoupling in the weak-coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a high-order dynamical decoupling (DD) scheme for arbitrary system-bath interactions in the weak-coupling regime. Given any decoupling group $\mathcal G$ that averages the interaction to zero, our construction yields pulse sequences whose length scales as $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal G| K)$, while canceling all error terms linear in the system-bath coupling strength up to order $K$ in the total evolution time. As a corollary, for an $n$-qubit system with $k$-local system-bath interactions, we obtain an $\mathcal{O}(n^{k-1}K)$-pulse sequence, a significant improvement over existing schemes with $\mathcal{O}(\exp(n))$ pulses (for $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$). The construction is obtained via a mapping to the continuous necklace-splitting problem, which asks how to cut a multi-colored interval into pieces that give each party the same share of every color. We provide explicit pulse sequences for suppressing general single-qubit decoherence, prove that the pulse count is asymptotically optimal, and verify the predicted error scaling in numerical simulations. For the same number of pulses, we observe that our sequences outperform the state-of-the-art Quadratic DD in the weak-coupling regime. We also note that the same construction extends to suppress slow, time-dependent Hamiltonian noise.</description>

      <title>Matchgate synthesis via Clifford matchgates and $T$ gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matchgate unitaries are ubiquitous in quantum computation due to their relation to non-interacting fermions and because they can be used to benchmark quantum computers. Implementing such unitaries on fault-tolerant devices requires first compiling them into a discrete universal gate set, typically Clifford$+T$. Here, we propose a different approach for their synthesis: compile matchgate unitaries using only matchgate gates. To this end, we first show that the matchgate-Clifford group (the intersection of the matchgate and Clifford groups) plus the $\overline{T}$ gate (a $T$ unitary up to a phase) is universal for the matchgate group. Our approach leverages the connection between $n$-qubit matchgate circuits and the standard representation of $\mathbb{SO}(2n)$, which reduces the compilation from $2^n\times 2^n$ unitaries to $2n\times2n$ ones, thus reducing exponentially the size of the target matrix. Moreover, we rigorously show that this scheme is efficient, as an approximation error $\varepsilon_{\mathbb{SO}(2n)}$ incurred in this smaller-dimensional representation translates at most into an $O(n \,\varepsilon_{\mathbb{SO}(2n)})$ error in the exponentially large unitary. In addition, we study the exact version of the matchgate synthesis problem, and we prove that all matchgate unitaries $U$ such that $U\otimes U^*$ has entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}\big[1/\sqrt 2,i\big]$ can be exactly synthesized by a finite sequence of gates from the matchgate-Clifford$+\overline{T}$ set, without ancillas. We then use this insight to map optimal exact matchgate synthesis to Boolean satisfiability, and compile the circuits that diagonalize the free-fermionic $XX$ Hamiltonian on $n=4,\,8$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Deterministic Inference of $k$-Independent Set Instances on Neutral Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy quantum annealing experiments on Rydberg atom arrays produce measurement outcomes that deviate from ideal distributions, complicating performance evaluation. To enable a data-driven benchmarking methodology for quantum devices that accounts for both solution quality and the classical computational cost of inference from noisy measurements, we introduce deterministic error mitigation (DEM), a shot-level inference procedure informed by experimentally characterized noise. We demonstrate this approach using the decision version of the $k$-independent set problem. Within a Hamming-shell framework, the DEM candidate volume is governed by the binary entropy of the bit-flip error rate, yielding an entropy-controlled classical postprocessing cost. Using experimental measurement data, DEM reduces postprocessing overhead relative to classical inference baselines. Numerical simulations and experimental results from neutral atom devices validate the predicted scaling with system size and error rate. These scalings indicate that one hour of classical computation on an Intel i9 processor corresponds to neutral atom experiments with up to $N=250-450$ atoms at effective error rates, enabling a direct, cost-based comparison between noisy quantum experiments and classical algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The no-signalling principle is a fundamental assumption in Bell-inequality and quantum-steering experiments. Nonetheless, experimental imperfections can lead to apparent violations beyond those expected from finite-sample statistics. Here, we propose extensions of local hidden variable and local hidden state theories that allow for bounded, operationally quantifiable, amounts of signalling. We show how non-classicality tests can be developed for these models, both through exact methods based on the full set of observed statistics and through corrections to the standard Bell and steering inequalities. We demonstrate the applicability of these methods via two scenarios that feature apparent signalling: an IBM quantum processor and post-selected data from inefficient detectors.</description>

      <title>Single shot distinguishability of noisy quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the intriguing features of quantum theory, the problem of distinguishing quantum channels is of fundamental interest. In this paper, we focus on the single-shot discrimination of two noisy quantum channels using two distinct classes of probes: single-system (product) probes and entangled probes. Our aim is to identify optimal probing state for specific discrimination tasks and to analyze the necessity and role of entanglement in enhancing channel distinguishability. We show that maximally entangled probes are optimal for discriminating two qubit depolarizing channels, with any nonzero entanglement providing an advantage over single-system probes. In contrast, for dephasing channels in arbitrary dimensions, we prove that single-system probe can be optimal and that entanglement offers no improvement, even when the dephasing unitary is generalized. For qubit amplitude-damping channels, we identify distinct noise-dependent regimes in which either single-system probe outperforms maximally entangled probes and vice-versa. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-maximally entangled probes can act as the optimum probe if the noise parameters restricted to certain values in this task. We also present examples of noisy unitary channels for which discrimination is possible using non-maximally entangled probe, while both single-systems and maximally entangled probes fail. We introduce another class of noisy unitary channels for which perfect discrimination is achievable with a single system, while maximally entangled probes are insufficient. Finally, we show that two erasure channels can be optimally discriminated using any pure single-system probe, with no advantage gained from entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution allows two legitimate parties to share a common secret key and encompasses reconciliation protocols. A relatively new reconciliation protocol, Arithmetic Reconciliation, presents low complexity and has increasing reconciliation efficiency with lower SNRs. In this paper, we obtain reconciliation efficiencies for this protocol in realistic scenarios, by means of estimation of mutual information, and we also present rates for sequence match of secret keys by Alice and Bob. Results show that this technique is feasible and promising to continuous variable quantum key distribution applications.</description>

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental classical computing operation whose efficiency becomes a major challenge at scale, especially for machine learning applications. Quantum computing, with its inherent parallelism and exponential storage capacity, offers a potential solution to these limitations. This work presents a quantum kernel-based matrix multiplication algorithm (QKMM) that achieves an asymptotically optimal computational complexity of $ O(N^2 \log_2 N) $, outperforming the classical optimal complexity of $ O(N^{2.371552}) $, where $N$ denotes the matrix dimension. Through noiseless and noisy quantum simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits superior theoretical efficiency but also shows practical advantages in runtime performance and stability.</description>

      <title>Simulation of boson sampling with optical feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical model of boson sampling with optical feedback, in which a subset of the interferometer's output modes is looped back into the input modes. If the bosons are injected periodically into the input modes of the interferometer and optical feedback lines' length match the period of injection, it allows for interference between bosons injected at the consequent time iterations. We propose several methods methods for computing the output photon distributions in both output spacial and temporal modes, including not only standard spatiotemporal mode-unfolding technique, but also the Kraus-operator formalism, and a correlation-tensor-based approach. The two latter approaches help us to reveal that for random interferometers this system evolves to a unique stationary state over time. Because of the existence of the stationary state, we introduce new computational problem \textit{Stationary Distribution Boson Sampling} which appears to be harder than conventional boson sampling problem and contains it as a special case when there are no optical feedback lines.</description>

      <title>Adaptive controllable architecture of analog Ising machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a quantum-inspired, non-traditional analog solver architecture, the analog Ising machine (AIM) has emerged as a distinctive computational paradigm to address the rapidly growing demand for computational power. However, the mathematical understanding of its principles, as well as the optimization of its solution speed and accuracy, remain unclear. In this work, we for the first time systematically discuss multiple implementations of AIM and establish a unified mathematical formulation. On this basis, by treating the binarization constraint of AIM (such as injection locking) as a Lagrange multiplier in optimization theory and combining it with a Lyapunov analysis from dynamical systems theory, an analytical framework for evaluating solution speed and accuracy is constructed, and further demonstrate that conventional AIMs possess a theoretical performance upper bound. Subsequently, by elevating the binarization constraint to a control variable, we propose the controllable analog Ising machine (CAIM), which integrates control Lyapunov functions and momentum-based optimization algorithms to realize adaptive sampling-feedback control, thereby surpassing the performance limits of conventional AIMs. In a proof-of-concept CAIM demonstration implemented using an FPGA-controlled LC-oscillator Ising machine, CAIM achieves a twofold speedup and a 7\% improvement in accuracy over AIM on a 50-node all-to-all weighted MaxCut problem, validating both the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous reconstruction of quantum process and noise via corrupted sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum processes, including quantum gates and channels, are integral to various quantum information tasks, making the efficient characterization of these processes and their underlying noise critically important. Here, we propose a framework for quantum process tomography in the presence of corrupted noise that is able to simultaneously reconstruct the process and corrupted noise. Firstly, within the Choi-state representation, we derive the corresponding generalized restricted isometry property and demonstrate the simultaneous reconstruction of various quantum gates under sparse noise. Moreover, in comparison with the Choi-state scheme, the process-matrix representation is employed to simultaneously reconstruct sparse noise and a broader range of target quantum gates. Our results demonstrate that significant reduction in experimental configurations is achievable even under corrupted noise.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Benchmark of a Solid-State Spin-Photon Interface for Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interfaces are pivotal for quantum computation and communication. While typically analyzed using single-mode or open-quantum-system approximations, these models often neglect multi-mode field states and light-matter entanglement, hindering exact protocol modeling. Here, we solve the full Hamiltonian dynamics of a solid-state spin-photon interface for three key protocols: the generation of photon-number superpositions, a controlled photon-photon gate, and the production of photonic cluster states. By deriving exact fidelities, we identify fundamental performance limits. Our results reveal that while realistic imperfections severely limit photon-photon gates, they only slightly affect linear photonic clusters and are nearly harmless for photon-number state superpositions.</description>

      <title>Investigations on Quantum Correlations and Open Quantum System Dynamics Through Nuclear Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear spins provide an ideal platform for studying quantum correlations and open quantum system dynamics across diverse areas, including quantum information, quantum foundations, and many-body physics. This is enabled by their long longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) coherence times and precise control using radio frequency pulses. In this thesis, I present my work using nuclear spins to explore these themes.
  First, I study temporal quantum correlations quantified by the Leggett Garg inequality (LGI) for a qubit evolving under a superposition of unitary operators. Using a three qubit quantum register, we experimentally realized superposed unitaries and observed LGI violations exceeding the maximal quantum bound of 1.5, indicating enhanced non-classicality. Notably, this superposed unitary dynamics also showed improved robustness against decoherence.
  Next, I investigate Lee Yang zeros, which are zeros of the partition function in the complex plane that reveal thermodynamic behavior near criticality. We proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method to determine the full set of Lee Yang zeros of an asymmetric Ising model using a single quantum probe in a three-qubit nuclear spin register. We further showed that the mutual information between the probe and system peaks at times corresponding to these zeros.
  I then report our study of the quantum Mpemba effect in nuclear spin relaxation, where systems farther from equilibrium can relax faster than those closer to steady state, verified both theoretically and experimentally using NMR. Finally, I discuss our work on entanglement localization and delocalization induced by local interactions, leading to an apparent violation of the quantum data processing inequality. We showed that this violation is only apparent by constructing a completely positive and trace preserving map describing the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Numerical approaches to entangling dynamics from variational principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the numerical identification of entanglement in dynamical scenarios. To this end, we consider different programs based on the restriction of the evolution to the set of separable (i.e., non-entangled) states, together with the discretization of the space of variables for numerical computations. As a first approach, we apply linear splitting methods to the restricted, continuous equations of motion derived from variational principles. We utilize an exchange interaction Hamiltonian to confirm that the numerical and analytical solutions coincide in the limit of small time steps. The application to different Hamiltonians shows the wide applicability of the method to detect dynamical entanglement. To avoid the derivation of analytical solutions for complex dynamics, we consider variational, numerical integration schemes, introducing a variational discretization for Lagrangians linear in velocities. Here, we examine and compare two approaches: one in which the system is discretized before the restriction is applied, and another in which the restriction precedes the discretization. We find that the "first-discretize-then-restrict" method becomes numerically unstable, already for the example of an exchange-interaction Hamiltonian, which can be an important consideration for the numerical analysis of constrained quantum dynamics. Thereby, broadly applicable numerical tools, including their limitations, for studying entanglement over time are established for assessing the entangling power of processes that are used in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of arbitrary Hermitian-preserving and trace-preserving maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum control has been a cornerstone of quantum information science, driving major advances in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. Over the years, it has enabled the implementation of arbitrary completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) maps; an important next step is to extend control to Hermitian-preserving and trace-preserving (HPTP) maps, which underpin applications such as entanglement detection, quantum error mitigation, quantum simulation, and quantum machine learning. Here we present an efficient and fully constructive method for implementing arbitrary HPTP maps. Unlike existing methods that decompose an HPTP map into multiple CPTP maps or approximate it using bipartite Hamiltonians with large Hilbert spaces, our approach compiles a target HPTP map into a single executable CPTP map whose Kraus rank is guaranteed to be no larger than the intrinsic rank of the target HPTP map plus one, followed by simple classical post-processing. Numerical results for inverse noise channels used in quantum error mitigation, including bosonic photon loss, confirm substantial reductions in resources and highlight scalability in higher-dimensional settings. Together with our numerical benchmarks, these results validate the efficiency and versatility of the proposed framework, opening a route to broader quantum-information applications enabled by HPTP processing.</description>

      <title>Advanced Quantum Communication and Quantum Networks -- From basic research to future applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical communication is the basis for many of our current and future technologies, such as mobile phones, video conferences, autonomous vehicles and particularly the internet. In contrast, quantum communication is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Due to this fundamental difference, it might offer enormous benefits for security applications, more precise measurements, faster computations, and many other fields of application by interconnecting different quantum devices, such as quantum sensors, quantum computers, or quantum memories. This review provides an overview of the specific properties of quantum information networks. This includes the interfaces between the classical and the quantum regime, the transmission of the quantum information by physical implementations, and potential future applications of quantum networks. We aim to provide a starting point based on fundamental concepts of quantum information processing for further research on a future quantum internet.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Message Complexity of Distributed Wake-Up with Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the distributed wake-up problem with advice, where nodes are equipped with initial knowledge about the network at large. After the adversary awakens a subset of nodes, an oracle computes a bit string (``the advice'') for each node, and the goal is to wake up all sleeping nodes efficiently. We present the first upper and lower bounds on the message complexity for wake-up in the quantum routing model, introduced by Dufoulon, Magniez, and Pandurangan (PODC 2025). In more detail, we give a distributed advising scheme that, given $\alpha$ bits of advice per node, wakes up all nodes with a message complexity of $O( \sqrt{\frac{n^3}{2^{\max\{\lfloor (\alpha-1)/2 \rfloor},0\}}}\cdot\log n )$ with high probability. Our result breaks the $\Omega( \frac{n^2}{2^\alpha} )$ barrier known for the classical port numbering model in sufficiently dense graphs. To complement our algorithm, we give a lower bound on the message complexity for distributed quantum algorithms: By leveraging a lower bound result for the single-bit descriptor problem in the query complexity model, we show that wake-up has a quantum message complexity of $\Omega( n^{3/2} )$ without advice, which holds independently of how much time we allow. In the setting where an adversary decides which nodes start the algorithm, most graph problems of interest implicitly require solving wake-up, and thus the same lower bound also holds for other fundamental problems such as single-source broadcast and spanning tree construction.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Sensitivity of Niobium- and Tantalum-Based Superconducting Qubits to Infrared Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of tantalum films for superconducting qubits has recently extended qubit coherence times significantly, primarily due to reduced dielectric losses at the metal-air interface. However, the choice of base material also influences the sensitivity to quasiparticle-induced decoherence. In this study, we investigate quasiparticle tunneling rates in niobium and tantalum-based offset-charge-sensitive qubits. Using a source of thermal radiation, we characterize the sensitivity of either material to infrared radiation and explore the impact of the infrared background through the targeted use of in-line filters in the wiring and ambient infrared absorbers. We identify both radiation channels as significant contributions to decoherence for tantalum but not for niobium qubits and achieve tunneling rates of 100 Hz and 300 Hz for niobium and tantalum respectively upon installation of infrared filters. Additionally, we find a time-dependence in the observed tunneling rates on the scale of days, which we interpret as evidence of slowly cooling, thermally radiating components in the experimental setup. Our findings indicate that continued improvements in coherence times may require renewed attention to radiative backgrounds and experimental setup design, especially when introducing new material platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Adjoints and Petz Recovery Maps for Unknown Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformations of quantum channels, such as the transpose, complex conjugate, and adjoint, are fundamental to quantum information theory. Given access to an unknown channel, a central problem is whether these transformations can be implemented physically with quantum supermaps. While such supermaps are known for unitary operations, the situation for general quantum channels is fundamentally different. In this work, we establish a strict hierarchy of physical realizability for the transposition, complex conjugation, and adjoint transformation of an unknown quantum channel. We present a probabilistic protocol that exactly implements the transpose with a single query. In contrast, we prove no-go theorems showing that neither the complex conjugate nor the adjoint can be implemented by any completely positive supermap, even probabilistically. We then overcome this impossibility by designing a virtual protocol for the complex conjugate based on quasi-probability decomposition, and show its optimality in terms of the diamond norm. As a key application, we propose a protocol to estimate the expectation values resulting from the Petz recovery map of an unknown channel, achieving an improved query complexity compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Entropy Bounds via Hypothesis Testing and Its Applications to Two-Way Key Distillation in Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) achieves information-theoretic security, without relying on computational assumptions, by distributing quantum states. To establish secret bits, two honest parties exploit key distillation protocols over measurement outcomes resulting after the the distribution of quantum states. In this work, we establish a rigorous connection between the key rate achievable by applying two-way key distillation, such as advantage distillation, and quantum asymptotic hypothesis testing, via an integral representation of the relative entropy. This connection improves key rates at small to intermediate blocklengths relative to existing fidelity-based bounds and enables the computation of entropy bounds for intermediate to large blocklengths. Moreover, this connection allows one to close the gap between known sufficient and conjectured necessary conditions for key generation in the asymptotic regime, while the precise finite blocklegth conditions remain open. More broadly, our work shows how advances in quantum multiple hypothesis testing can directly sharpen the security analyses of QKD.</description>

      <title>Thermal-Drift Sampling: Generating Random Thermal Ensembles for Quantum Chaos Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random thermal states of many-body Hamiltonians underpin studies of thermalization, chaos, and quantum phase transitions, yet their generation remains costly when each Hamiltonian must be prepared individually. We introduce the thermal-drift channel, a measurement-based operation that implements a tunable nonunitary drift along a chosen Pauli term. Based on this channel, we present a measurement-controlled sampling algorithm that generates thermal states together with their Hamiltonian "labels" for general physical models. We prove that the total gate count of our algorithm scales cubically with system size, quadratically with inverse temperature, and as the inverse error tolerance to the two-thirds power, with logarithmic dependence on the allowed failure probability. We also show that the induced label distribution approaches a normal distribution reweighted by the thermal partition function, which makes an explicit trade-off between accuracy and effective range. Numerical simulations for a 2D Heisenberg model validate the predicted scaling and distribution. As an application, we compute unfolding-free level-spacing ratio statistics from sampled thermal states of a 2D transverse-field Ising model and observe a crossover toward the Wigner--Dyson prediction, demonstrating a practical and scalable route to chaos diagnostics and random matrix universality studies on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Mitigation at the pre-processing stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers remains a challenging endeavor, forcing state-of-the-art quantum hardware to rely heavily on noise mitigation techniques. Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement on the output state. The main idea is to find an observable $Y$ such that its expectation value on a noisy quantum state $\mathcal{E(\rho)}$ matches the expectation value of a target observable $X$ on the noiseless quantum state $\rho$. Our method requires the execution of a noisy quantum circuit, followed by the measurement of the surrogate observable $Y$. The main enablers of our method in practical scenarios are Tensor Networks. The proposed method improves over Tensor Error Mitigation (TEM) in terms of average error, circuit depth, and complexity, attaining a measurement overhead that approaches the theoretical lower bound. The improvement in terms of classical computation complexity is in the order of $\sim 10^6$ times when compared to the post-processing computational cost of TEM in practical scenarios. Such gain comes from eliminating the need to perform the set of informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (IC-POVM) required by TEM, as well as any other tomographic strategy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization of Integer Graph Problems and Surpassing Semidefinite Programming for Max-k-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for binary optimization problems have been the subject of extensive study. However, the application of quantum algorithms to integer optimization problems remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we study the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to integer problems on graphs, with each integer variable encoded in a qudit. We derive a general iterative formula for depth-$p$ QAOA expectation on high-girth $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary size. The cost of evaluating the formula is exponential in the QAOA depth $p$ but does not depend on the graph size. Evaluating this formula for Max-$k$-Cut problem for $p\leq 4$, we identify parameter regimes ($k=3$ with degree $d \leq 10$ and $k=4$ with $d \leq 40$) in which QAOA outperforms the Frieze-Jerrum semi-definite programming (SDP) algorithm, which provides the best worst-case guarantee on the approximation ratio. To strengthen the classical baseline we introduce a new heuristic algorithm, based on the degree-of-saturation, that empirically outperforms both the Frieze-Jerrum algorithm and shallow-depth QAOA. Nevertheless, we provide numerical evidence that QAOA may overtake this heuristic at depth $p\leq 20$. Our results show that moving beyond binary to integer optimization problems can open up new avenues for quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>One-Way Quantum Secure Direct Communication with Choice of Measurement Basis as the Secret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of the distinguishability of ensembles described by the same compressed density operator, we propose a model for one-way quantum secure direct communication using finite ensembles of shared EPR pairs per bit and a public authenticated classical channel, where the local choice of one of two mutually-unbiased measurement bases is the secret bit. In this model, both the encoding and decoding of classical information in quantum systems are implemented by measurements in either the computational or the Hadamard basis. Using the quantum wiretap channel theory, we study the secure net bit rates and certify information-theoretic security of different implementations of our model when the quantum channel is subjected to BB84-symmetric attacks. Since no local unitary operations need to be performed by the receiver, the proposed model is suitable for real-life implementation of secure direct communication in star network configurations.</description>

      <title>Improved Rodeo Algorithm Performance for Spectral Functions and State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rodeo Algorithm is a quantum computing method for computing the energy spectrum of a Hamiltonian and preparing its energy eigenstates. We discuss how to improve the performance of the rodeo algorithm for each of these two applications. In particular, we demonstrate that using a geometric series of time samples offers a near-optimal optimization space for a given total runtime by studying the Rodeo Algorithm performance on a model Hamiltonian representative of gapped many-body quantum systems. Analytics explain the performance of this time sampling and the conditions for it to maintain the established exponential performance of the Rodeo Algorithm. We finally demonstrate this sampling protocol on various physical Hamiltonians, showing its practical applicability. Our results suggest that geometric series of times provide a practical, near-optimal, and robust time-sampling strategy for quantum state preparation with the Rodeo Algorithm across varied Hamiltonians without requiring model-specific fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Improving Ground State Accuracy of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers with Soft-coded Orthogonal Subspace Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of ground state estimates in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms by employing subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints. As in other subspace-based VQE methods, such as the Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) and Multistate Contracted VQE (MCVQE), once the parameters are optimized to maximize the subspace overlap with the low-energy sector of the Hamiltonian, one diagonalizes the Hamiltonian restricted to the subspace. Unlike these methods, where \emph{hard-coded} orthogonality constraints are enforced at the circuit level among the states spanning the subspace, we consider a subspace representation where orthogonality is \emph{soft-coded} via penalty terms in the cost function. We show that this representation allows for shallower quantum circuits while maintaining high fidelity when compared to single-state (standard VQE) and multi-state (SSVQE or MCVQE) representations, on two benchmark cases: a $3\times 3$ transverse-field Ising model and random realizations of the Edwards--Anderson spin-glass model on a $4\times 4$ lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise scaling in continuously operating multiparameter sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the quantum noise mechanisms that limit continuously operating multiparameter quantum sensors. Using a hybrid rf-dc optically pumped magnetometer, we map the photon shot noise, spin projection noise, and measurement back-action noise over an order of magnitude in probe power and a factor of three in pump power while remaining quantum-noise-limited. We observe linear, quadratic, and cubic scaling of the respective total noise powers with probe photon flux, together with a quadratic dependence of back-action on pump photon flux, in quantitative agreement with a stochastic Bloch-equation model. At higher probe powers, additional probe-induced relaxation modifies the spin-noise spectrum while preserving the integrated noise scaling. Our results reveal fundamental, resource-dependent trade-offs unique to continuously monitored multiparameter sensors and establish experimentally the quantum limits governing their optimal operation.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dicke Time Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the system in the thermodynamic limit, we establish the existence of TQC order in this system for a wide parameter regime. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this behavior persists even in the deep quantum regime with only two qubits. We systematically study the dependence of the TQC lifetime, $\tau^{\ast}$, on the number of qubits and demonstrate that $\tau^{\ast}$ increases monotonically with the system size. Our work demonstrates that quasi-periodically driven dissipative quantum systems can serve as a powerful platform for realizing novel non-equilibrium phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Modeling integrated frequency shifters and beam splitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computing is a strong contender in the race to fault-tolerance. Recent proposals using qubits encoded in frequency modes promise a large reduction in hardware footprint, and have garnered much attention. In this encoding, linear optics, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters, is necessarily not energy-conserving, and is costly to implement. In this work, we present designs of frequency-mode beam splitters based on modulated arrays of coupled resonators. We develop a methodology to construct their effective transfer matrices based on the SLH formalism for quantum input-output networks. Our methodology is flexible and highly composable, allowing us to define $N$-mode beam splitters either natively based on arrays of $N$-resonators of arbitrary connectivity or as networks of interconnected $l$-mode beam splitters, with $l&lt;N$. We apply our methodology to analyze a two-resonator device, a frequency-domain phase shifter and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer obtained from composing these devices, a four-resonator device, and present a formal no-go theorem on the possibility of natively generating certain $N$-mode frequency-domain beam splitters with arrays of $N$-resonators.</description>

      <title>Graph--Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics on a cold-atom quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms have become a powerful platform for quantum-simulating lattice gauge theories in higher spatial dimensions. However, such realizations have been restricted to the lowest possible truncations of the gauge field, which limit the connections one can make to lattice quantum electrodynamics. Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Krylov complexity through quantum walks: An exploration of the quantum origins of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the efficiency with which "dissipated" work can generate distinguishable changes in a quantum many-body state at a finite temperature, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information. The bound follows solely from the analytic structure of equilibrium many-body correlators and is independent of all microscopic details. It takes a frequency-resolved form with a characteristic crossover at the Planckian scale, $\omega_\star\sim k_B T/\hbar$. We find that Planckian scatterers sit at the edge of optimality, displaying maximal relaxation rate before information-dissipation efficiency collapses. This suggests strange metals are not just fast dissipators, but the fastest that remain efficient in generating distinguishability. The bounded quantity can be evaluated directly from optical conductivity measurements in strongly correlated electronic systems, offering a unique window into how dissipation generates distinguishable changes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on stability and renormalization group flows in nonequilibrium matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive constraints on renormalization group (RG) flows and stability of phases in nonequilibrium systems using quantum information inequalities. These constraints involve conditional mutual information (CMI), which quantifies correlations between spatially separated regions not mediated by their surroundings. First, assuming CMI is UV finite, we show that the scaling function associated with CMI is monotonic along the RG flow. This implies a non-perturbative stability criterion: a fixed point with smaller CMI cannot be destabilized toward one with larger CMI. Second, we bound the CMI of a convex mixture of states in terms of the CMI of individual components. We use this inequality to infer perturbative stability of spontaneous symmetry breaking states against quantum channels that explicitly break symmetry. We illustrate these constraints through several examples, including decoherence-driven transitions in classical symmetry-broken states, strong-to-weak symmetry breaking criticality in two dimensions, and even transitions in pure quantum states. We also discuss implications for classical nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Minimal Hamiltonian deformations as bulk probes of effective non-Hermiticity in Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals describe open gain--loss systems, yet at charge neutrality models featuring real spectrum often look Hermitian-like, with NH effects absorbed into renormalized band parameters. Here we show that a response-based diagnostic of effective non-Hermiticity can be formulated using minimal pseudo-Lorentz-symmetry-breaking deformations, which separate observables that remain captured by parameter redefinitions from those that exhibit irreducible NH structure. For a two-dimensional NH Dirac semimetal in the weak-NH, real-spectrum regime, we analyze Dirac-cone tilt and velocity anisotropy and compute representative probes of spectral structure, quantum geometry, optical response, and viscoelasticity at zero temperature. We find that tilt yields an NH-dependent slope of the density of states that cannot be collapsed to a single effective velocity, while velocity anisotropy can be captured by effective-velocity reparametrization. Furthermore, the quantum metric and collisionless optical conductivities provide NH-insensitive benchmarks (with the nonlinear conductivity symmetry selected), whereas the shear viscosity offers a discriminator through its tensor structure. Our results identify minimal deformations and bulk response channels that enable access to effective non-Hermiticity even when the spectrum remains real.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information Revealing Parameter Sensitivity in Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determination of the leptonic CP-violating phase $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$, the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, and the mass-squared difference $\Delta m_{31}^{2}$ constitutes a primary objective of current and next-generation long-baseline neutrino experiments. We employ QFI (QFI) to establish fundamental precision bounds on single-parameter estimation in three-flavor $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillations, treating the neutrino as an evolving pure quantum state. Computing QFI as a function of the baseline-to-energy ratio $L/E$ for benchmark parameter sets from NuFit-6.0, we find distinct sensitivity hierarchies and $L/E$-dependent structures. Specifically, $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and $\theta_{23}$ exhibit bimodal QFI profiles with peaks at $L/E \sim 500$ and $1500~\mathrm{km/GeV}$, corresponding to the first and second oscillation maxima, reaching $F_Q(\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}) \sim 0.15$ and $F_Q(\theta_{23}) \sim 15$, respectively. In contrast, $\Delta m_{31}^{2}$ displays a unimodal structure peaking at $L/E \sim 1000$--$1200~\mathrm{km/GeV}$ with $F_Q(\Delta m_{31}^{2}) \sim 3 \times 10^{6}$, reflecting its role in setting the oscillation length scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a premier solid-state platform for the deterministic generation of nonclassical light, offering a compelling pathway toward scalable quantum photonic systems. While single-photon emission from QDs has reached a high level of maturity, the realization of high-fidelity entangled photon-pair sources remains an active and rapidly evolving frontier. In this review, we survey the recent progress in QD-based entangled photon sources, highlighting the conceptual evolution from the established biexciton-exciton cascade to the emerging paradigm of spontaneous two-photon emission. We further examine how advances in nanophotonic architectures and coherent control strategies are redefining fundamental performance limits, enabling concurrent improvements in source brightness, coherence, and entanglement fidelity. Finally, we discuss the key physical and technological challenges that must be addressed to bridge the gap between laboratory demonstrations and large-scale deployment. We conclude by outlining the future opportunities for integrating QD-based entangled photon sources into practical quantum communication, computation, and sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>More on OTOCs and Chaos in Quantum Mechanics -- Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit thermal out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in single-particle quantum systems, focusing on magnetic billiards. Using the stadium billiard as a testbed, we compute the thermal OTOC $C_T(t) = -\langle [x(t), p]^2 \rangle_\beta$ and extract Lyapunov-like exponents $\lambda_L$ that quantify early-time growth. We map out $\lambda_L(T, B)$, revealing a crossover from quantum chaos to magnetic rigidity. In parallel, we compute an alternative OTOC built from guiding-center operators, which exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics and no exponential growth. Our results offer a controlled framework for probing scrambling, temperature dependence, and the interplay of geometry and magnetic fields in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization for Multi-Objective Supply Chain Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-objective logistics optimization problem from a real-world supply chain is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Problem (QUBO) that minimizes cost, emissions, and delivery time, while maintaining target distributions of supplier workshare. The model incorporates realistic constraints, including part dependencies, double sourcing, and multimodal transport. Two hybrid quantum-classical solvers are proposed: a structure-aware informed tree search (IQTS) and a modular bilevel framework (HBS), combining quantum subroutines with classical heuristics. Experimental results on IonQ's Aria-1 hardware demonstrate a methodology to map real-world logistics problems onto emerging combinatorial optimization-specialized hardware, yielding high-quality, Pareto-optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Topological Phase Transition in non-Hermitian Photonic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While energy band topology in spatial photonic crystals (PCs) and momentum-band topology in temporal crystals have each served as powerful probes of topological phases in their respective domains, their unification in a static platform remains unexplored. In this Letter, we bridge this gap by introducing a waveguide assisted non-Hermitian SSH model, in which controlled tuning of loss and coupling drives PT-symmetry breaking and enables a continuous transition between energy- and momentum-gap regimes. This allows us to construct a complete spatiotemporal topological phase diagram in a unified parameter space. By mapping this phase diagram onto a spatially graded PC, we experimentally observe multiple Bloch momentum-band gaps and a continuous spatiotemporal topological transition via translating across the static sample, enabling real-time control over the evolution pathway of the band topology. Our work creates a versatile, bias-free platform for exploring synthetic spacetime physics and opens new avenues for controlling light via non-Hermitian band engineering.</description>

      <title>Dispersion in nonlinear interferometry: implications for optical coherence tomography with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum interferometers based on non-degenerate optical parametric down-conversion exhibit strong unbalanced group velocity dispersion (GVD). This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Correlation and Relativistic Effects on Atomic Ionization Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interplay between relativistic effects and electron correlation effects on the first ionization energies of heavy atoms (Au through Rn, Z = 79-86). We perform two complementary analyses: (1) comparing relativistic corrections computed at both the Hartree-Fock (HF) and coupled cluster CCSD(T) levels to assess how correlation influences the magnitude of relativistic corrections, and (2) comparing correlation corrections computed within both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks to determine how relativity influences the magnitude of correlation corrections.
  Our results reveal a striking non-linear relationship between these two effects. Specifically, the combined effect of relativity and correlation on ionization energy does not equal the sum of their individual contributions. This non-additivity indicates that relativistic and correlation effects are not independent; they interact in complex ways that depend on the atomic system. We find that for some atoms, the two effects enhance each other, while for others they partially cancel. Moreover, the order in which one may add "separate" effects also counts, in that adding "pure" relativistic effects to the remaining outcome (including correlation) would give a different result than when adding "pure" correlation effects to the remaining outcome (including relativity).
  These findings demonstrate that relativistic and correlation effects are inherently non-additive, reflecting the non-linearity of the quantum many-body problem. Accurate computational predictions of ionization energies in heavy-element systems thus require simultaneous treatment of both effects rather than treating them as independent contributions.</description>

      <title>Color Centers and Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A New Platform for Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) confine mid-infrared light to deep-subwavelength scales and may offer a powerful route to strong light-matter interactions. Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.</description>

      <title>Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Computational Cost Scaling of Tensor Network Algorithms via Field-Programmable Gate Array Parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the computational efficiency of quantum many-body calculations from a hardware perspective remains a critical challenge. Although field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently been exploited to improve the computational scaling of algorithms such as Monte Carlo methods, their application to tensor network algorithms is still at an early stage. In this work, we propose a fine-grained parallel tensor network design based on FPGAs to substantially enhance the computational efficiency of two representative tensor network algorithms: the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) and the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). By employing a quad-tile partitioning strategy to decompose tensor elements and map them onto hardware circuits, our approach effectively translates algorithmic computational complexity into scalable hardware resource utilization, enabling an extremely high degree of parallelism on FPGAs. Compared with conventional CPU-based implementations, our scheme exhibits superior scalability in computation time, reducing the bond-dimension scaling of the computational cost from $O(D_b^3)$ to $O(D_b)$ for iTEBD and from $O(D_b^6)$ to $O(D_b^2)$ for HOTRG. This work provides a theoretical foundation for future hardware implementations of large-scale tensor network computations.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Parity Breaking in Quantum Antiferromagnets on the Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustration on the triangular lattice has long been a source of intriguing and often debated phases in many-body systems. Although symmetry analysis has been employed, the role of the seemingly trivial parity symmetry has received little attention. In this work, we show that phases induced by frustration are systematically shaped by an implicit rule of thumb associated with spontaneous parity breaking. This principle enables us to anticipate and rationalize the regimes and conditions under which nontrivial phases emerge. For the spin-$S$ antiferromagnetic XXZ model, we demonstrate that a controversial parity-broken phase appears only at intermediate values of $S$. In bilayer systems, enhanced frustration leads to additional phases, such as supersolids, whose properties can be classified by their characteristic parity features. Benefiting from our improved tensor network contraction techniques, we confirm these results through large-scale tensor-network calculations. This study offers an alternative viewpoint and a systematic approach for examining the interplay between spin, symmetry, and frustration in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Local measurements and the entanglement transition in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the transition between short-range entangled (SRE) and long-range ordered (and therefore long-range entangled) states of infinite quantum spin chains, which is induced by local measurements. Specifically, we assume that the initial state is in a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phase with local symmetry group $\mathcal{G} = G \times H$, where $G$ is an Abelian subgroup. We show that the on-site measurements of the local $G$-charge on intervals of increasing lengths transform the initial SRE state into a family of states with increasingly long-range correlations. In particular, the post-measurement states cannot be uniformly short-range entangled. In the case where the initial state is obtained from a product state using a quantum cellular automaton, we construct the infinite-volume post-measurement state and exhibit almost local observables that are maximally correlated.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Dynamics of Particles and Quasiparticles in a Bose-Einstein-condensate array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement plays a crucial role in a quantum system beyond just learning about the system state: it changes the post-measurement state and hence influences the subsequent time evolution; further, measurement can even create entanglement in the post-measurement conditional state. In this work, we study how careful choice of parameters for a typical measurement process on cold atoms systems -- phase contrast imaging -- has a strong impact on both what the experimentalist observes but also on the backaction the measurement has on the system, including the creation and diffusion of quasiparticles emerging from the quantum many-body dynamics. We focus on the case of a Bose-Einstein-condensate array, in the low-temperature and low-momentum limit. Our theoretical investigation reveals regimes where the imaging light probes either the bare particle or quasiparticle dynamics. Moreover, we find a path to selectively measuring quasiparticle modes directly, as well as controlling over the measurement-induced creation and diffusion of quasiparticles into different momentum states. This lays a foundation for understanding the effects of both experimental approaches for probing many-body systems, but also more speculative directions such as observable consequences of `spontaneous collapse' predictions from novel models of quantum gravity on aspects of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>"It from Bit": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires neither mixing of alpha sectors nor any modification of the rules of the gravitational path integral. The apparent tension is resolved by sharply distinguishing the baby-universe Hilbert space, namely the space of closed universes viewed from the outside, from the bulk Hilbert space that governs quantum mechanics for an observer inside a single de Sitter universe. The baby-universe Hilbert space, together with its commutative operator algebra, is not a quantum-mechanical Hilbert space: it is merely a mathematical repackaging of classical probability theory and does not carry any quantum-mechanical structure at all, a direct consequence of the one-state property of closed universes. Accordingly, attempting to formulate quantum mechanics directly on the baby-universe Hilbert space conflates classical ensemble data with the quantum mechanics experienced by bulk observers and leads to physically incorrect conclusions. By contrast, the quantum mechanics experienced by an observer inside de Sitter space emerges from the classical statistics encoded in the baby-universe Hilbert space, providing a concrete realization of Wheeler's idea of "It from Bit". We demonstrate these features by completely solving a topological toy model of one-dimensional de Sitter spacetime. Along the way we clarify the physical meaning of de Sitter entropy, showing that it corresponds to the coarse-grained entropy of the underlying state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we identify bound and resonance states in the low-lying $S$-wave sector. Deeply bound states are found exclusively in the isoscalar $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ channel, dominated by color-singlet meson-meson components with non-negligible hidden-color contributions. The resulting masses and binding energies are consistent with classical chiral quark model predictions, establishing quantum simulation as a viable framework for studying exotic multiquark states beyond the reach of conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Schr\"odinger operator describing four particles in two dimensions, interacting solely through short-range three-body forces, can possess infinitely many bound states. This holds under the assumption that each three-body subsystem has a virtual level at zero energy. Our result establishes an analog of the Efimov effect for such four-particle systems in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Extended Rydberg Lifetimes in a Cryogenic Atom Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization of a $^{133}$Cs optical tweezer array in a cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment. By enclosing the array within a 4K radiation shield, we measure long Rydberg lifetimes, up to $406 (36)\,\mu$s for the $55 P_{3/2}$ Rydberg state, a factor of 3.3(3) longer than the room-temperature value. We employ single-photon coupling for coherent manipulation of the ground-Rydberg qubit. We measure a small differential dynamic polarizability of the transition, beneficial for reducing dephasing due to light intensity fluctuations. Our results pave the path for advancing neutral-atom two-qubit gate fidelities as their error budgets become increasingly dominated by $T_1$ relaxation of the ground-Rydberg qubit.</description>

      <title>Does Cosmology require Hermiticity in Quantum Mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of allowing non-Hermitian structures in quantum cosmology by extending the Wheeler DeWitt framework beyond strictly Hermitian dynamics. Using a controlled semiclassical reduction, we show how anti Hermitian contributions propagate into both early universe primordial fluctuations and late-time structure growth as effective damping or gain terms. Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history. We demonstrate that these bounds are mutually consistent between early and late-time probes and can be partially relaxed in theories beyond General Relativity. Our results establish cosmology as a novel arena for testing foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and suggest that Hermiticity may emerge dynamically along the semiclassical branch describing our universe.</description>

      <title>Efficient net-gain integrated optical parametric amplifier in the quantum regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) are promising to overcome the wavelength coverage and noise limitations in conventional optical amplifiers based on rare-earth doping and semiconductor gain. However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA. Our work marks a significant step towards ideal optical amplifiers with strong amplification, high efficiency, quantum-limited noise, large bandwidth, and continuous-wave operation, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation photonic information processing systems.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic-Quantum Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces several new classes of mathematical structures that have close connections with physics and with the theory of dynamical systems. The most general of these structures, called indivisible stochastic processes, collectively encompass many important kinds of stochastic processes, including Markov chains and random dynamical systems. This paper then states and proves a new theorem that establishes a precise correspondence between any indivisible stochastic process and a unitarily evolving quantum system. This theorem therefore leads to a new formulation of quantum theory, alongside the Hilbert-space, path-integral, and quasi-probability formulations. The theorem also provides a first-principles explanation for why quantum systems are based on the complex numbers, Hilbert spaces, linear-unitary time evolution, and the Born rule. In addition, the theorem suggests that by selecting a suitable Hilbert space, together with an appropriate choice of unitary evolution, one can simulate any indivisible stochastic process on a quantum computer, thereby potentially opening up an extensive set of novel applications for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Estimating the electrical energy cost of performing arbitrary state preparation using qubits and qudits in integrated photonic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum photonic hardware scales toward computationally relevant sizes, energy consumption has emerged as a key constraint. Programmable photonic integrated circuits, composed of interferometer meshes with tunable phase modulators, provide a flexible platform for quantum information processing using both qubits and qudits. In this work, we analyze the energetic cost of such devices by focusing on arbitrary quantum state preparation, a resource-intensive task central to quantum simulation and information processing. Using a common hardware, we benchmark qudit-based implementations, gate-based quantum computation, and measurement-based quantum computation. We find that while qudit encodings are attractive at small scale, their footprint and reconfiguration costs grow rapidly with system size, whereas qubit-based approaches incur significant overhead from entangling operations, feedforward, and reprogramming. Across all paradigms, scaling beyond a few tens of qubits renders either the energy consumption or the total preparation time prohibitive on fully programmable PICs. Our results highlight the need for optimized, task-specific photonic architectures to enable energy-efficient scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic ground states are of central importance in chemical simulations, but have remained beyond the reach of efficient classical algorithms except in cases of weak electron correlation or one-dimensional spatial geometry. We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical eigenvalue solver that constructs a wavefunction ansatz from a linear combination of matrix product states in rotated orbital bases, enabling the characterization of strongly correlated ground states with arbitrary spatial geometry. The energy is converged via a gradient-free generalized sweep algorithm based on quantum subspace diagonalization, with a potentially exponential speedup in the off-diagonal matrix element contractions upon translation into compact quantum circuits of linear depth in the number of qubits. Chemical accuracy is attained in numerical experiments for both a stretched water molecule and an octahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms, achieving substantially better correlation energies compared to a unitary coupled-cluster benchmark, with orders of magnitude reductions in quantum resource estimates and a surprisingly high tolerance to shot noise. This proof-of-concept study suggests a promising new avenue for scaling up simulations of strongly correlated chemical systems on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Generalized group designs: constructing novel unitary 2-, 3- and 4-designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary designs are essential tools in several quantum information protocols. Similarly to other design concepts, unitary designs are mainly used to facilitate averaging over a relevant space, in this case, the unitary group $\mathrm{U}(d)$. While it is known that exact unitary $t$-designs exist for any degree $t$ and dimension $d$, the most appealing type of designs, group designs (in which the elements of the design form a group), can provide at most $3$-designs. Moreover, even group $2$-designs can exist only in limited dimensions. In this paper, we present novel construction methods for creating exact generalized group designs based on the representation theory of the unitary group and its finite subgroups that overcome the $4$-design-barrier of unitary group designs. Furthermore, a construction is presented for creating generalized group $2$-designs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Resource state generation for a multispin register in a hybrid matter-photon quantum information processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum architectures that integrate matter and photonic degrees of freedom present a promising pathway toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing. This approach needs to combine well-established entangling operations between distant registers using photonic degrees of freedom with direct interactions between matter qubits within a solid-state register. The high-fidelity control of such a register, however, poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these challenges with pulsed control sequences which modulate all inter-spin interactions to preserve the nearest-neighbor couplings while eliminating unwanted long-range interactions. We derive pulse sequences, including broadband and selective gates, using composite pulse and shaped pulse techniques as well as optimal control methods. This ensures a general pulse sequence in the presence of spin-position bias, and robustness against static offset detunings, and Rabi frequency fluctuations of the control fields. The control techniques developed here apply well beyond the present setting to a broad range of physical platforms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods for the resource state generation for fusion-based quantum computing in four- and six-spin systems encoded in the electronic ground states of nitrogen-vacancy centers or other molecular solid-state qubits. We also outline other elements of the proposed architecture, highlighting its potential for advancing quantum computing technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative stabilization of cat qubits autonomously corrects for bit flip errors by ensuring that reservoir-engineered two-photon losses dominate over other mechanisms inducing phase flip errors. To describe the latter, we derive an effective master equation for an asymmetrically threaded SQUID based superconducting circuit used to stabilize a dissipative cat qubit. We analyze the dressing of relaxation processes under drives in time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory for weakly anharmonic bosonic degrees of freedom, and in numerically exact Floquet theory. We find that spurious single-photon decay rates can increase under the action of the parametric pump that generates the required interactions for cat-qubit stabilization. Our analysis feeds into mitigation strategies that can inform current experiments, and the methods presented here can be extended to other circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Localizing multipartite entanglement with local and global measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the task of localizing multipartite entanglement in pure quantum states onto a subsystem by measuring the remaining systems. To this end, we fix a multipartite entanglement measure and consider two quantities: the multipartite entanglement of assistance (MEA), defined as the entanglement measure averaged over the post-measurement states and maximized over arbitrary measurements; and the localizable multipartite entanglement (LME), defined in the same way but restricted to only local single-system measurements. We choose the n-tangle, the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the concentratable entanglement (CE) as the underlying seed measure, and discuss the resulting MEA and LME quantities. First, we prove easily computable upper and lower bounds on MEA and LME and establish Lipschitz-continuity for the n-tangle and CE-based LME and MEA. Using these bounds we investigate the typical behavior of entanglement localization by deriving concentration inequalities for the MEA evaluated on Haar-random states and performing numerical studies for small tractable system sizes. We then turn our attention to protocols that transform graph states. We give a simple criterion based on a matrix equation to decide whether states with a specified n-tangle value can be obtained from a given graph state, providing no-go theorems for a broad class of such graph state transformations beyond the usual local Clifford plus local Pauli measurement framework. We generalize this analysis to weighted graph states and show that our entanglement localization framework certifies the near-optimality of recently discussed local-measurement protocols to transform uniformly weighted line graph states into GHZ states. Finally, we demonstrate how our MEA and LEA quantities can be used to detect phase transitions in transversal field Ising models.</description>

Abstract: Markovian master equations underlie many areas of modern physics and, despite their apparent simplicity, they encode a rich and complex dynamics which is still under active research. We identify a class of continuous variable Markovian master equations for which positivity and complete positivity become equivalent. We apply this result to characterize the positivity of the partially transposed evolution of bipartite Gaussian systems, which encodes the dynamics of entanglement. Finally, the entangling properties of models of classical gravity interacting with quantum matter are investigated in the context of the experimental proposals to detect gravitationally induced entanglement. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. We prove that entanglement generation can indeed take place within these models. In particular, by focusing on the Di\'osi-Penrose model for two gravitationally interacting masses, we show that entanglement-based experiments have the potential to either falsify the model entirely or constrain the free parameter of the model $R_0$ up to values six orders of magnitude above the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Niobium Air Bridges as Low-Loss Components for Superconducting Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling up superconducting quantum processors requires a high routing density for readout and control lines, relying on low-loss interconnects to maintain design flexibility and device performance. We propose and demonstrate a universal subtractive fabrication process for air bridges based on an aluminum hard mask and niobium as the superconducting film. Using this technology, we fabricate superconducting CPW resonators incorporating multiple niobium air bridges in and across their center conductors. Through rigorous cleaning methods, we achieve mean internal quality factors in the single-photon limit exceeding $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.2 \times 10^6$. Notably, the loss per air bridge remains below the detection threshold of the resonators. Due to the larger superconducting energy gap of niobium compared to conventional aluminum air bridges, our approach enables stable performance at elevated temperatures and magnetic fields, which we experimentally confirm in temperatures up to 3.9 K and in a magnetic field of up to 1.60 T. Additionally, we utilize air bridges to realize low-loss vacuum-gap capacitors and demonstrate their successful integration into transmon qubits by achieving median qubit lifetimes of $T_1 = 51.6 \,\mu\text{s}$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum batteries can be charged by performing a work ``instantaneously'' in the limit of large number of cells. In general, the work exhibits statistics that can be represented by a quasiprobability in the presence of initial quantum coherence in the energy basis. Here we show that these two concepts of quantum thermodynamics, which apparently appear disconnected, show a simple relation. Specifically, if the work distribution shows negativity in some time interval, then we can surely get quantum advantage in the charging process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum non-orthogonal multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements between reference states. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of ansatz that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: linear combinations of orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and linear combinations of states prepared by generalized UCCSD circuits of polynomial depth, for which computing the expectation values of local fermionic observables up to a constant additive error is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. We discuss the implications for achieving practical quantum advantage in resolving the electronic structure of catalytic systems composed from multivalent transition metal atoms using near-term quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) plays a central role in characterizing quantum gates and circuits, diagnosing quantum devices, calibrating hardware, and supporting quantum error correction. However, conventional QPT methods face challenges related to scalability and sensitivity to noise. In this work, we propose a QPT framework based on quantum compilation, which represents quantum processes using optimized Kraus operators and Choi matrices. By formulating QPT as a compilation and optimization problem, our approach significantly reducing measurement and computational overhead while maintaining reconstruction accuracy. We benchmark the method using numerical simulations of Haar-random unitary gates and demonstrate a reliable process reconstruction. We further apply the framework to dephasing channels with both time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous noise, as well as to depolarizing and amplitude-damping channels, where stable performance is observed across different noise regimes. These results indicate that quantum compilation-based QPT can serve as a practical alternative to standard QPT methods for quantum process characterization and device validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we delve into the theory of sheared potentials in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. After defining what we mean by a family of sheared potentials, we consider these families in two particular but emblematic cases, the harmonic oscillator and the symmetric potential well proportional to $|x|$. In both cases, besides determining the spectra, we analyse the impact of the shearing process on the respective eigenfunctions. The latter analysis is typically left aside in the literature, but here we show that the sheared eigenfunctions yield insights that allow for a deeper understanding of the main features exhibited by the spectra. Finally, we make a few comments about the connection between the change in the spectra of a given sheared family and the necessary work that must be made by an external agent to implement such a change.</description>

      <title>Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allows us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of five. This reduction falls four orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While non-reciprocal couplings are ubiquitous in classical systems, their impact on quantum many-body criticality and entanglement remains largely unexplored. Using exact numerical simulations, we study an interacting fermionic chain subject to non-reciprocal gain and loss. We show that the interplay between dissipation and interactions drives a dissipative phase transition, marked by the opening of a many-body gap and a crossover from power-law to exponential relaxation. The weakly-interacting regime displays non-reciprocal signatures, including nonzero currents and directional charge accumulation reminiscent of the skin effect. Notably, despite this localization, quantum trajectories exhibit volume-law entanglement. Finally, reciprocity is dynamically restored above a critical interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Shaping Cold Atom Clouds with a Vortex Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method for shaping a cold atom cloud using a vortex laser beam with a polarization singularity at its center, which creates a point of vanishing intensity. Exploiting this feature we experimentally demonstrate two different schemes to create micron-scaled line- and sheet-like atomic density distributions. In the dynamic scheme, atoms in the bright beam regions are accelerated and therefore effectively removed from the cloud. In the dark-state scheme, these atoms are pumped into a state that does not interact with the shaping light. In both cases, an atomic distribution remains, either as a thin line or as a sheet when an additional polarizer is used. We find good agreement between the experimental results and our theoretical model, which predicts the method to be in principle not diffraction-limited, paving the way for studies of phenomena arising in unconfined atomic ensembles on the micrometer scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a robust pulse optimization method for adiabatic population transfer and adiabatic quantum computation. The approach relies on identifying control pulses that keep the evolving quantum system close to its instantaneous ground state. By combining advanced gradient-free optimization tools with specialized cost functions for adiabatic control, it achieves both efficiency and robustness. To demonstrate its generality, we apply the method to three examples involving both atomic and superconducting qubits. We test different optimization cost functions and discretization bases, showing that the approach outperforms ensemble optimization. Finally, to verify its performance on real quantum hardware, we implement digitized adiabatic qubit control using the optimized pulses on the IBM Quantum cloud.</description>

      <title>Replacement-Type Quantum Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and with neutral atom qubits with error rates predicted near the threshold of the XZZX surface code. By making use of the extended Hilbert space, including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise bias which motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Universality in the Anticoncentration of Noisy Quantum Circuits at Finite Depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present universal properties of anticoncentration in weakly noisy quantum circuits at finite depth. We develop a generic framework for single- and multi-qubit noise channels in the weak-noise limit and introduce an effective description in terms of a random matrix product operator (RMPO). Within this weak-noise regime, we show that distinct noise mechanisms act in a quantitatively similar way, yielding a universal distribution of bit-string probabilities that is largely independent of the microscopic noise channel and of the circuit architecture. We identify three depth-dependent regimes, each characterized by a distinct scaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) with rescaled depth. In the shallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the intermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal footing; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes effectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the noise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for anticoncentration in generic finite-depth circuits and benchmark them against numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement even at shallow depths. Moreover, we show that, contrary to previous expectations, the late-time value of XEB provides direct access to the global circuit fidelity, even at large noise strengths. Our results are directly applicable to current quantum processors and demonstrate universal behavior beyond the pure random-matrix-theory regime, which only emerges at asymptotically large depths.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-free interaction and maximally entangled state generation in giant-atom semi-infinite waveguide systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant atoms are artificial atoms that can couple to a waveguide non-locally. Previous works have shown that two giant atoms in a braided configuration can interact through one-dimensional (1D) infinite and chiral waveguides, with both individual and collective atomic relaxation being fully suppressed. In this paper, however, we show that the decoherence-free interaction (DFI) between two giant atoms can be realized in both braided and nested configurations when the waveguide is semi-infinite. This protected interaction fails to appear in semi-infinite waveguide systems containing two separate giant atoms or two small atoms. We also study the entanglement generation between two giant atoms coupled to a 1D semi-infinite waveguide. The results show that the maximally entangled state is generated in both braided and nested configurations due to the formation of DFI, and in the separate configuration, the maximally achievable entanglement can exceed 0.5. Finally, we generalize the discussion on DFI and entanglement generation to the case involving multiple giant atoms coupled into a semi-infinite waveguide. This study presents a new scheme for realizing DFI and generating maximally entangled states in giant-atom waveguide-QED systems.</description>

      <title>Subspace Variational Quantum Simulation: Fidelity Lower Bounds as Measures of Training Success</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an iterative variational quantum algorithm to simulate the time evolution of arbitrary initial states within a given subspace. The algorithm compresses the Trotter circuit into a shorter-depth parameterized circuit, which is optimized simultaneously over multiple initial states in a single training process using fidelity-based cost functions. After the whole training procedure, we provide an efficiently computable lower bound on the fidelities for arbitrary states within the subspace, which guarantees the performance of the algorithm in the worst-case training scenario. We also show our cost function exhibits a barren-plateau-free region near the initial parameters at each iteration in the training landscape. The experimental demonstration of the algorithm is presented through the simulation of a 2-qubit Ising model on an IBMQ processor. As a demonstration for a larger system, a simulation of a 10-qubit Ising model is also provided.</description>

Abstract: Networks of sensors are a promising scheme to deliver the benefits of quantum technologies in coming years, offering enhanced precision and accuracy for distributed metrology through the use of large entangled states. Recent work has additionally explored the privacy of these schemes, meaning that local parameters can be kept secret while a joint function of these is estimated by the network. In this work, we use the abstract cryptography framework to relate the two proposed definitions of quasi-privacy, showing that both are composable, which enables the protocol to be securely included as a sub-routine to other schemes. We give an explicit example that estimating the mean of a set of parameters using GHZ states is composably fully secure.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the steady-state phases of the one-dimensional quantum contact process model. We present the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit and uncover the metastability of the system. Exploiting the mean-field approximations with a novel self-consistent condition based on the effective field, we capture the avoid the interference of the metastable state. We show the feature of saddle-node bifurcation of the order parameter revealing the discontinuous phase transition of the steady state and extract the transition point for infinite-size system. We show the monotonic decreasing of the steady-state magnetic susceptibility by the linked-cluster expansion, which does not support the divergence of the correlation length at the vicinity of the transition point. The present results may be tested in the quantum simulator of Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Modified Langevin noise formalism for multiple quantum emitters in dispersive electromagnetic environments out of equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of interactions among quantum emitters through nanophotonic structures offers significant opportunities for quantum technologies. However, a rigorous theoretical description of the interaction of multiple quantum emitters with complex, dispersive dielectric objects remains challenging. Here, we introduce an approach based on the modified Langevin noise formalism that unveils the roles of both the noise polarization currents of the dielectrics and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field scattered by the dielectrics. This work extends Refs. \cite{miano_quantum_2025} and \cite{miano_spectral_2025} to the general case of an arbitrary number of emitters. The proposed approach allows us to describe the dynamics of the quantum emitters for arbitrary initial quantum states of the electromagnetic environment, consisting of two independent bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density matrix. Specifically, we examine situations where both reservoirs are initially in thermal quantum states but have different temperatures. Understanding how these reservoirs shape the dynamics of the emitters is crucial for understanding light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments and for improving intrinsic emitter properties within structured environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising tools for demonstrating quantum utility on near-term quantum hardware, with applications in optimisation, quantum simulation, and machine learning. While researchers have studied how easy VQAs are to train, the effect of quantum noise on the classical optimisation process is still not well understood. Contrary to expectations, we find that twirling, which is commonly used in standard error-mitigation strategies to symmetrise noise, actually degrades performance in the variational setting, whereas preserving biased or non-unital noise can help classical optimisers find better solutions. Analytically, we study a universal quantum regression model and demonstrate that relatively uniform Pauli channels suppress gradient magnitudes and reduce expressivity, making optimisation more difficult. Conversely, asymmetric noise such as amplitude damping or biased Pauli channels introduces directional bias that can be exploited during optimisation. Numerical experiments on a variational eigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model confirm that non-unital noise yields lower-energy states compared to twirled noise. Finally, we show that coherent errors are fully mitigated by re-parameterisation. These findings challenge conventional noise-mitigation strategies and suggest that preserving noise biases may enhance VQA performance.</description>

      <title>Limits of Absoluteness of Observed Events in Timelike Scenarios: A No-Go Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wigner's Friend-type paradoxes challenge the assumption that events are absolute -- that when we measure a system, we obtain a single result, which is not relative to anything or anyone else. These paradoxes highlight the tension between quantum theory and our intuitions about reality being observer-independent. Building on a recent result that developed these paradoxes into a no-go theorem, namely the Local Friendliness Theorem, we introduce the Causal Friendliness Paradox, a time-ordered analogue of it. In this framework, we replace the usual locality assumption with Axiological Time Symmetry (ATS), and show that, when combined with the assumptions of Absoluteness of Observed Events (AOE), No Retrocausality (NRC), and Screening via Pseudo Events (SPE), we obtain a causal inequality. We then show that quantum mechanics violates this inequality and is therefore incompatible with at least one of these assumptions. To probe which assumption might be incompatible, we then examine whether AOE in its entirety is essential for this no-go result. We propose a weaker, operational form of AOE that still leads to inequalities that quantum mechanics violates. This result shows that even under relaxed assumptions, quantum theory resists reconciliation with classical notions of absolute events, reinforcing the foundational significance of Wigner's Friend-type paradoxes in timelike scenarios.</description>

      <title>Comparing Schemes for Creating Qudit Graph States from 16- &amp; 128-dimensional Hilbert Space using Donors in Silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we compare two schemes for generating arbitrary qudit graph states using spin qudits in silicon. The first scheme proposes the creation of qudit linear graph states from a single emitter - a silicon spin qudit. By employing fusion - a destructive and non-deterministic measurement technique - these linear graphs can then be combined to form more complex resource states (multi-photon entangled states), such as ring or ladder structures, which are used to carry out the computation. The second scheme employs two spin qudits. Instead of relying on fusion, the two emitters are directly coupled via CZ to generate the same resource states, thereby eliminating the need for fusion. We compare the two schemes in terms of their ability to produce equivalent resource states and discuss their respective advantages and limitations for building scalable architectures.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we propose the Quantum Gradient Flow Algorithm (QGFA), a novel quantum algorithm for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems based on the variational formulation and time-evolution dynamics. Conventional quantum linear solvers, such as the quantum matrix inverse algorithm (QMIA), focus on approximating the matrix inverse through quantum signal processing (QSP). However, QMIA suffers from a crucial drawback: its computational efficiency deteriorates as the condition number increases. In contrast, classical SPD linear solvers, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods, are known for their fast convergence, which stems from the variational optimization principle of SPD systems. Inspired by this, we develop QGFA, which obtains the solution vector through the gradient-flow process of the corresponding quadratic energy functional. To validate the proposed method, we apply QGFA to the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) for two-dimensional linear elastic problems under plane stress conditions. The algorithm demonstrates accurate convergence toward classical FEM solutions even with a moderate number of QSP phase factors. Compared with QMIA, QGFA achieves lower relative errors and faster convergence when initialized with suitable initial states, demonstrating its potential as an efficient preconditioned quantum linear solver. The proposed framework provides a physically interpretable connection between classical iterative solvers and quantum computational paradigms. These findings suggest that QGFA can serve as a foundation for future developments in Quantum Computer-Aided Engineering (Quantum CAE), including nonlinear and multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>A Time-Symmetric Variational Formulation of Quantum Mechanics: Schr\"odinger Dynamics from Boundary-Driven Indeterminism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard quantum mechanics requires two incompatible dynamical principles: unitary evolution and measurement collapse. We present a variational framework that replaces this dualism with a single principle, in which Schr\"odinger dynamics are not postulated; they arise as the unique solution to a two-time boundary-value problem. By expressing the state in terms of hydrodynamic variables $(\rho, \mathbf{j})$ subject to a continuity constraint, we show that a Fisher-information regularization term necessitates the standard Schr\"odinger equation as an optimality condition. This formulation inverts the standard causal logic: rather than evolving an initial state forward, the dynamics arise from minimizing a global action that connects imperfectly specified initial and final boundary constraints. Consequently, the boundary conditions act as the active selectors of the trajectory, selecting a specific hydrodynamic flow from an ensemble of admissible histories. Unlike deterministic formulations such as Bohmian mechanics, which Landsman (2022) has shown requires an external "random oracle" to generate Kolmogorov-random outcome sequences, our framework reframes this oracle problem by accounting for effective randomness through the interplay between boundary uncertainty and global constraint satisfaction. We show that the Born rule emerges naturally as a consistency condition for the closure of the primal-dual equations, where the Fisher penalty acts as an information cost that suppresses simple, differentiable trajectories in favor of complex flows whose coarse-grained statistics effectively mimic stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Composite Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.</description>

      <title>Quantum state exclusion with many copies</title>

Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is the task of identifying at least one state from a known set that was not used in the preparation of a quantum system. A set of quantum states is said to admit state exclusion if there exists a measurement whose outcomes can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the states in the set, such that each outcome rules out its corresponding state with certainty (while possibly also ruling out other states), and each outcome occurs with nonzero probability for at least one state in the set. State exclusion, however, is not always possible in the single-copy setting. In this paper, we investigate whether access to multiple identical copies of the system enables state exclusion. We prove that for any set of three or more pure states, state exclusion becomes possible with a finite number of copies. Moreover, we show that the number of copies required may be arbitrarily large: in particular, for every natural number $N$, we construct sets of states for which state exclusion remains impossible with $N$ or fewer copies.</description>

      <title>Entangled photon pair excitation and time-frequency filtered multidimensional photon correlation spectroscopy as a probe for dissipative exciton kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. This approach alleviates bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics spread across multiple spectral and temporal windows. We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, thereby circumventing transport in mediating one-exciton states. The evolution of these population distributions and cascading transitions can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources with multidimensional photon counting allows promising applications in spectroscopy and sensing.</description>

      <title>Optimized adiabatic-impulse protocol preserving Kibble-Zurek scaling with attenuated anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an optimized adiabatic-impulse (OAI) protocol that substantially reduces the evolution time for crossing a quantum phase transition while preserving Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling. Near criticality, the control parameter is ramped linearly across the critical point at a rate characterized by a quench time $\tau_Q$. Away from criticality, the evolution remains adiabatic and is tuned close to the threshold of adiabatic breakdown, as quantified by an adiabatic coefficient $\zeta$ that scales as $\tau_Q^\alpha$. As a consequence, the total evolution time exhibits a sublinear power-law dependence on $\tau_Q$, and the conventional linear quench is recovered in the limit $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. We apply the OAI protocol to the transverse Ising chain and numerically determine the minimal $\zeta$ required for KZ scaling. We further investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of a noisy field that can induce anti-Kibble-Zurek (AKZ) behavior. Within the OAI protocol, noise-induced defects is significantly attenuated due to the shorter evolution time. The optimal quench time at which the defect density is minimized obeys an altered universal power-law scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we generalize the OAI protocol to the nonlinear quenches and numerically demonstrate a marked reduction in noise-induced defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a principle, implicitly contained in Schroedinger's paper (Schr35), which allows a proof of the non-existence of the EPR-locality paradox in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The paradox is shown to be well-posed already in the simplest example of an entangled state of two spins one-half, independently of the (well-taken) objections by Araki and Yanase that the measurement of spin is not a local measurement. We assume that any measurement results in the collapse of the wave-packet.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on non-local computation from controllable correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding entanglement cost in non-local quantum computation (NLQC) is relevant to complexity, cryptography, gravity, and other areas. This entanglement cost is largely uncharacterized; previous lower bound techniques apply to narrowly defined cases, and proving lower bounds on most simple unitaries has remained open. Here, we give two new lower bound techniques that can be evaluated for any unitary, based on their controllable correlation and controllable entanglement. For Haar random two qubit unitaries, our techniques typically lead to non-trivial lower bounds. Further, we obtain lower bounds on most of the commonly studied two qubit quantum gates, including CNOT, DCNOT, $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$, and the XX interaction, none of which previously had known lower bounds. For the CNOT gate, one of our techniques gives a tight lower bound, fully resolving its entanglement cost. The resulting lower bounds have parallel repetition properties, and apply in the noisy setting.</description>

      <title>Single-site dissipation stabilizes a superconducting nonequilibrium steady state in a strongly correlated system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can superconducting order be engineered as a robust attractor of open-system dynamics in strongly correlated systems? We demonstrate this possibility by proposing a minimal dissipation-engineering protocol for the particle-hole symmetric Hubbard model. By applying a rotated quantum jump operator, specifically a locally transformed $\eta$-pair lowering operator, on a single lattice site only, we show that the Lindblad evolution autonomously pumps the system from the vacuum into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) exhibiting macroscopic $\eta$-pair off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization stands in stark contrast to schemes reliant on spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a single local dissipative seed suffices to establish long-range coherence across the entire interacting lattice system. We elucidate the underlying mechanism via three core features: local dark-state selection, the controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we systematically classify the stability of this NESS with respect to static disorder, and identify a wide regime in which the superconducting attractor remains robust against Hamiltonian perturbations that preserve the effective subspace structure. We also pinpoint specific perturbations that directly cause dephasing of the $% \eta$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO. These findings open up a disorder-tolerant pathway for stabilizing superconducting order as a non-thermal attractor through minimal local quantum-jump control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal light sources exhibiting photon bunching have been suggested for sensing applications that exploit timing correlations of stationary light, including range finding, clock synchronization, and non-line-of-sight imaging. However, these proposals have remained unrealized in practice because available sources of photon bunching either possess coherence times too short to be timing resolved by photodetectors, or produce brightness levels too low to tolerate realistic return losses. In this work, we demonstrate a low-loss method for generating photon bunching with a conversion efficiency nearly 9 orders of magnitude higher than that achieved by many other bunching processes.</description>

Abstract: We present a unified information-theoretic framework elucidating the interplay between stability, privacy, and the generalization performance of quantum learning algorithms. We establish a bound on the expected generalization error in terms of quantum mutual information and derive a probabilistic upper bound that generalizes the classical result by Esposito et al. (2021). Complementing these findings, we provide a lower bound on the expected true loss relative to the expected empirical loss. Additionally, we demonstrate that $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-quantum differentially private learning algorithms are stable, thereby ensuring strong generalization guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to dishonest learning algorithms, introducing Information-Theoretic Admissibility (ITA) to characterize the fundamental limits of privacy when the learning algorithm is oblivious to specific dataset instances.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for building robust, fault-tolerant quantum computers; however, the decoding process often presents a significant computational bottleneck. Tesseract is a novel Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoder for QEC that employs the A* search algorithm to explore an exponentially large graph of error hypotheses, achieving high decoding speed and accuracy. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols. Our results demonstrate consistent speedups of approximately 2x for most code families, often exceeding 2.5x. Notably, we achieved a peak performance gain of over 5x for the most computationally demanding configurations of Bivariate-Bicycle Codes. These improvements make the Tesseract decoder more efficient and scalable, serving as a practical case study that highlights the importance of high-performance software engineering in QEC and providing a strong foundation for future research.</description>

Abstract: Quantum generative models offer a novel approach to exploring high-dimensional Hilbert spaces but face significant challenges in scalability and expressibility when applied to multi-modal distributions. In this study, we explore a Hybrid Quantum-Classical U-Net architecture integrated with Adaptive Non-Local Observables (ANO) as a potential solution to these hurdles. By compressing classical data into a dense quantum latent space and utilizing trainable observables, our model aims to extract non-local features that complement classical processing. We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes. While hardware constraints still impose limitations on resolution, our findings suggest that hybrid architectures with adaptive measurements provide a feasible pathway for mitigating mode collapse and enhancing generative capabilities in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Generation via test-time learning with large language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For the 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorems to optimally design a custom tool in support of research.</description>

Abstract: We study a two-matrix toy model with a BFSS-like interaction term using the collective field formalism. The main technical simplification is obtained by gauge-fixing first, and integrating out the off-diagonal elements, before changing to the collective field variable. We show that the resulting $(2+1)$-dimensional collective field action has novel features with respect to non-locality, and that we need to add a mass term to get a time-local potential. As is expected, one recovers the single matrix quantum mechanical collective field Hamiltonian in the proper limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of light-matter coupling strength on the efficiency of microcavity OLEDs: A unified quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, the Purcell effect can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for microcavity OLEDs. The model is then applied to estimate device performance in the different coupling regimes to determine which one is the best.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the correlation between entanglement and the negative sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo for the simulation of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum many body systems. Entanglement entropy characterizes the difficulty of many-body simulation with tensor network state related methods, while the average sign measures the difficulty in many-body simulation for a variety of quantum Monte Carlo methods. Although there exist cases where one type of method works better than the other, it is desirable to find the possible correlation between entanglement and average sign for general hard strongly correlated systems regarding computational complexity. We take the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example and numerically calculate the doping evolution of both the entanglement in the ground state with Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the average sign in the Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo simulation at low temperature. The results show that they are indeed correlated. The entanglement entropy (average sign) shows a peak (dip) around 20% doping, indicating that it is the difficult region for both methods. The vicinity of 20% doping is also the most intriguing region in both the Hubbard model and cuprate high-Tc superconductors where competing states with close energy intertwine with each other. Recognizing the correlation between entanglement and average sign provides new insight into our understanding of the difficulty in the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the topological spin of Majoranas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution, $e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling a $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge, and hence the topological spin, can be manipulated through the control of device geometry, introducing an additional control knob for topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the presence of this fractional charge through shifts in the critical current.</description>

      <title>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral gapped states are universally non-topological</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an operator generalization of the Li-Haldane conjecture regarding the entanglement Hamiltonian of a disk in a 2+1D chiral gapped groundstate. The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\mathfrak{c}_{\text{tot}})_{\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory. Our formalism also gives an explanation of the modular commutator formula for the chiral central charge.</description>

      <title>MultiAtomLiouvilleEquationGenerator: A Mathematica package for Liouville superoperators and master equations of multilevel atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MulAtoLEG (Multi-Atom Liouville Equation Generator) is an open-source Mathematica package for generating Liouville superoperators and Liouville equations, specialized for multilevel atomic systems comprising an arbitrary number of atoms. This scheme is based on an extension to multilevel atomic systems, originally developed by Lehmberg [R. H. Lehmberg, Phys. Rev. A 2, 883 (1970)] as an adjoint master equation for ensembles of two-level emitters and later reformulated by Genes [M. Reitz, C. Sommer and C. Genes, PRX Quantum 3, 010201 (2022)] as a master equation. The package facilitates the generation of equations for complex transition configurations in alkali atoms. Although primarily designed for atomic systems, it can also generate the master and adjoint master equations for general Hamiltonians and Lindbladians. In addition, it includes functionalities to construct the differential equations in the dressed-state basis, where, in many cases, the non-unitary evolution operator can be determined explicitly. To maximize computational efficiency, the package leverages Mathematica's vectorization and sparse linear algebra capabilities. Since MulAtoLEG produces exact equations without approximations, the feasible system size is naturally limited by the available computational resources.</description>

      <title>AlphaSyndrome: Tackling the Syndrome Measurement Circuit Scheduling Problem for QEC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for scalable quantum computing, yet repeated syndrome-measurement cycles dominate its spacetime and hardware cost. Although stabilizers commute and admit many valid execution orders, different schedules induce distinct error-propagation paths under realistic noise, leading to large variations in logical error rate. Outside of surface codes, effective syndrome-measurement scheduling remains largely unexplored. We present AlphaSyndrome, an automated synthesis framework for scheduling syndrome-measurement circuits in general commuting-stabilizer codes under minimal assumptions: mutually commuting stabilizers and a heuristic decoder. AlphaSyndrome formulates scheduling as an optimization problem that shapes error propagation to (i) avoid patterns close to logical operators and (ii) remain within the decoder's correctable region. The framework uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore ordering and parallelism, guided by code structure and decoder feedback. Across diverse code families, sizes, and decoders, AlphaSyndrome reduces logical error rates by 80.6% on average (up to 96.2%) relative to depth-optimal baselines, matches Google's hand-crafted surface-code schedules, and outperforms IBM's schedule for the Bivariate Bicycle code.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians in dissipative free fermions and the time-dependent GGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Entanglement Hamiltonians (EHs) in dissipative free-fermionic systems using a recent operator-based formulation of the quasiparticle picture. Focusing on gain and loss dissipation, we study the post-quench evolution and derive explicit expressions for the EH at the ballistic scale. In the long-time and weak-dissipation regime, the EH is shown to take the form of a time-dependent Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (t-GGE), with a structure that is universal across different initial states of the quench protocol. Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between classical and quantum resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bifurcations take place in molecular Hamiltonian nonlinear systems as the excitation energy increases, this leading to the appearance of different classical resonances. In this paper, we study the quantum manifestations of these classical resonances in the isomerizing system CN-Li$\leftrightarrows$Li-CN. By using a correlation diagram of eigenenergies versus Planck constant, we show the existence of different series of avoided crossings, leading to the corresponding series of quantum resonances, which represent the quantum manifestations of the classical resonances. Moreover, the extrapolation of these series to $\hbar=0$ unveils the correspondence between the bifurcation energy of classical resonances and the energy of the series of quantum resonances in the semiclassical limit $\hbar\to0$. Additionally, in order to obtain analytical expressions for our results, a semiclassical theory is developed.</description>
