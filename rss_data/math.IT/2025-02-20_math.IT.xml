      <title>Spectral method for low-dose Poisson and Bernoulli phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of phaseless reconstruction from measurements with Poisson or Bernoulli distributed noise. This is of particular interest in biological imaging experiments where a low dose of radiation has to be used to mitigate potential damage of the specimen, resulting in low observed particle counts. We derive recovery guarantees for the spectral method for these noise models in the case of Gaussian measurements. Our results give a quantitative insight in the trade-off between the employed radiation dose per measurement and the overall sampling complexity.</description>

      <title>System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration &amp; Coordination Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.</description>

      <title>First Glimpse on Physical Layer Security in Internet of Vehicles: Transformed from Communication Interference to Sensing Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) plays a crucial role in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), serving as a key factor in enhancing driving safety and traffic efficiency. To address the security challenges of the confidential information transmission caused by the inherent openness nature of wireless medium, different from current physical layer security (PLS) methods, which depends on the \emph{additional communication interference} costing extra power resources, in this paper, we investigate a novel PLS solution, under which the \emph{inherent radar sensing interference} of the vehicles is utilized to secure wireless communications. To measure the performance of PLS methods in ISAC-based IoV systems, we first define an improved security performance metric called by transmission reliability and sensing accuracy based secrecy rate (TRSA\_SR), and derive closed-form expressions of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), success ranging probability (SRP) for evaluating transmission reliability, security and sensing accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the TRSA\_SR by utilizing radar sensing interference and joint design of the communication duration, transmission power and straight trajectory of the legitimate transmitter. Finally, the non-convex feature of formulated problem is solved through the problem decomposition and alternating optimization. Simulations indicate that compared with traditional PLS methods obtaining a non-positive STC, the proposed method achieves a secrecy rate of 3.92bps/Hz for different settings of noise power.</description>

      <title>User Association and Coordinated Beamforming in Cognitive Aerial-Terrestrial Networks: A Safe Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive aerial-terrestrial networks (CATNs) offer a solution to spectrum scarcity by sharing spectrum between aerial and terrestrial networks. However, aerial users (AUs) experience significant interference from numerous terrestrial base stations (BSs). To alleviate such interference, we investigate a user association and coordinated beamforming (CBF) problem in CATN, where the aerial network serves as the primary network sharing its spectrum with the terrestrial network. Specifically, we maximize the sum rate of the secondary terrestrial users (TUs) under the interference temperature constraints of the AUs. Traditional iterative optimization schemes are impractical due to their high computational complexity and information exchange overhead. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based schemes can address these challenges, their performance is sensitive to the weights of the weighted penalty terms for violating constraints in the reward function. Motivated by these issues, we propose a safe DRL-based user association and CBF scheme for CATN, eliminating the need for training multiple times to find the optimal penalty weight before actual deployment. Specifically, the CATN is modeled as a networked constrained partially observable Markov game. Each TU acts as an agent to choose its associated BS, and each BS acts as an agent to decide its beamforming vectors, aiming to maximize the reward while satisfying the safety constraints introduced by the interference constraints of the AUs. By exploiting a safe DRL algorithm, the proposed scheme incurs lower deployment expenses than the penalty-based DRL schemes since only one training is required before actual deployment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher sum rate of TUs than a two-stage optimization scheme while the average received interference power of the AUs is generally below the threshold.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Function Computation Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the $K$-user computation broadcast problem consisting of a master node, that holds all datasets and users for a general class of function demands, including linear and non-linear functions, over finite fields. The master node sends a broadcast message to enable each of $K$ distributed users to compute its demanded function in an asymptotically lossless manner with user's side information. We derive bounds on the optimal $K$-user computation broadcast rate that allows the users to compute their demanded functions by capturing the structures of the computations and available side information. Our achievability scheme involves the design of a novel graph-based coding model to build a broadcast message to meet each user's demand, by leveraging the structural dependencies among the datasets, the user demands, and the side information of each user, drawing on K{\"o}rner's characteristic graph framework. The converse uses the structures of the demands and the side information available at $K$ users to yield a tight lower bound on the broadcast rate. With the help of examples, we demonstrate our scheme achieves a better communication rate than the existing state of the art.</description>

      <title>Secure and Green Rate-Splitting Multiple Access Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the sensing, communication, security, and energy efficiency of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled cognitive radio networks (CRNs) in a challenging scenario where communication quality, security, and sensing accuracy are affected by interference and eavesdropping. Specifically, we analyze the communication and sensing signals of ISAC as well as the communication signal consisting of common and private streams, based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) of multicast network. Then, the sensing signal-tocluster-plus-noise ratio, the security rate, the communication rate, and the security energy efficiency (SEE) are derived, respectively. To simultaneously enhance the aforementioned performance metrics, we formulate a targeted optimization framework that aims to maximizing SEE by jointly optimizing the transmit signal beamforming (BF) vectors and the echo signal BF vector to construct green interference using the echo signal, as well as common and private streams split by RSMA to refine security rate and suppress power consumption, i.e., achieving a higher SEE. Given the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we present an alternative approach that leverages Taylor series expansion, majorization-minimization, semi-definite programming, and successive convex approximation techniques. Specifically, we decompose the original non-convex and intractable optimization problem into three simplified sub-optimization problems, which are iteratively solved using an alternating optimization strategy. Simulations provide comparisons with state-of-the-art schemes, highlighting the superiority of the proposed joint multi-BF optimization scheme based on RSMA and constructed green interference in improving system performances.</description>

      <title>Optimal Overlap Detection of Shotgun Reads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting the overlap between a pair of short fragments sampled in random locations from an exponentially longer sequence, via their possibly noisy reads. We consider a noiseless setting, in which the reads are noiseless, and the sequence is only assumed to be stationary and ergodic. Under mild conditions on the mixing property of the process generating the sequence, we characterize exactly the asymptotic error probability of the optimal Bayesian detector. Similarly, we consider a noisy setting, in which the reads are noisy versions of the sampled fragments obtained via a memoryless channel. We further assume that the sequence is stationary and memoryless, and similarly characterize exactly the asymptotic error probability of the optimal Bayesian detector for this case.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal List-Recovery of Linear Code Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several results on linear codes achieving list-recovery capacity. We show that random linear codes achieve list-recovery capacity with constant output list size (independent of the alphabet size and length). That is, over alphabets of size at least $\ell^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$, random linear codes of rate $R$ are $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, (\ell/\varepsilon)^{O(\ell/\varepsilon)})$-list-recoverable for all $R\in(0,1)$ and $\ell$. Together with a result of Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya, this implies that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes also achieve list-recovery capacity. We also prove that our output list size is near-optimal among all linear codes: all $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, L)$-list-recoverable linear codes must have $L\ge \ell^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$.
  Our simple upper bound combines the Zyablov-Pinsker argument with recent bounds from Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, Wootters, and Tamo on the maximum intersection of a "list-recovery ball" and a low-dimensional subspace with large distance. Our lower bound is inspired by a recent lower bound of Chen and Zhang.</description>

      <title>NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent work have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Meta's SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3). Comparisons on various LLM evaluation benchmarks also show a reduction in performance degradation induced by quantization.</description>

      <title>SearchRAG: Can Search Engines Be Helpful for LLM-based Medical Question Answering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in general domains but often struggle with tasks requiring specialized knowledge. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques typically retrieve external information from static knowledge bases, which can be outdated or incomplete, missing fine-grained clinical details essential for accurate medical question answering. In this work, we propose SearchRAG, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by leveraging real-time search engines. Our method employs synthetic query generation to convert complex medical questions into search-engine-friendly queries and utilizes uncertainty-based knowledge selection to filter and incorporate the most relevant and informative medical knowledge into the LLM's input. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves response accuracy in medical question answering tasks, particularly for complex questions requiring detailed and up-to-date knowledge.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Replica Symmetry Breaking under the Nishimori conditions in epidemic inference on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian inference, computing the posterior distribution from the data is typically a non-trivial problem, which usually requires approximations such as mean-field approaches or numerical methods, like the Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Being a high-dimensional distribution over a set of correlated variables, the posterior distribution can undergo the notorious replica symmetry breaking transition. When it happens, several mean-field methods and virtually every Monte Carlo scheme can not provide a reasonable approximation to the posterior and its marginals. Replica symmetry is believed to be guaranteed whenever the data is generated with known prior and likelihood distributions, namely under the so-called Nishimori conditions. In this paper, we break this belief, by providing a counter-example showing that, under the Nishimori conditions, replica symmetry breaking arises. Introducing a simple, geometrical model that can be thought of as a patient zero retrieval problem in a highly infectious regime of the epidemic Susceptible-Infectious model, we show that under the Nishimori conditions, there is evidence of replica symmetry breaking. We achieve this result by computing the instability of the replica symmetric cavity method toward the one step replica symmetry broken phase. The origin of this phenomenon -- replica symmetry breaking under the Nishimori conditions -- is likely due to the correlated disorder appearing in the epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Breaking the bonds of generative artificial intelligence by minimizing the maximum entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), comprising large language models, text-to-image generators, and AI algorithms for medical drug and material design, had a transformative impact on society. However, despite an initial exponential growth surpassing Moore's law, progress is now plateauing, suggesting we are approaching the limits of current technology. Indeed, these models are notoriously data-hungry, prone to overfitting, and challenging to direct during the generative process, hampering their effective professional employment. To cope with these limitations, we propose a paradigm shift in GenAI by introducing an ab initio method based on the minimal maximum entropy principle. Our approach does not fit the data. Instead, it compresses information in the training set by finding a latent representation parameterized by arbitrary nonlinear functions, such as neural networks. The result is a general physics-driven model, which is data-efficient, resistant to overfitting, and flexible, permitting to control and influence the generative process. Benchmarking shows that our method outperforms variational autoencoders (VAEs) with similar neural architectures, particularly on undersampled datasets. We demonstrate the methods effectiveness in generating images, even with limited training data, and its unprecedented capability to customize the generation process a posteriori without the need of any fine-tuning or retraining.</description>

      <title>Deep-Unfolded Massive Grant-Free Transmission in Cell-Free Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grant-free transmission and cell-free communication are vital in improving coverage and quality-of-service for massive machine-type communication. This paper proposes a novel framework of joint active user detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) for massive grant-free transmission in cell-free wireless communication systems. We formulate JACD as an optimization problem and solve it approximately using forward-backward splitting. To deal with the discrete symbol constraint, we relax the discrete constellation to its convex hull and propose two approaches that promote solutions from the constellation set. To reduce complexity, we replace costly computations with approximate shrinkage operations and approximate posterior mean estimator computations. To improve active user detection (AUD) performance, we introduce a soft-output AUD module that considers both the data estimates and channel conditions. To jointly optimize all algorithm hyper-parameters and to improve JACD performance, we further deploy deep unfolding together with a momentum strategy, resulting in two algorithms called DU-ABC and DU-POEM. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed JACD algorithms via extensive system simulations.</description>

      <title>Quotients of skew polynomial rings: new constructions of division algebras and MRD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We achieve new results on skew polynomial rings and their quotients, including the first explicit example of a skew polynomial ring where the ratio of the degree of a skew polynomial to the degree of its bound is not extremal. These methods lead to the construction of new (not necessarily associative) division algebras and maximum rank distance (MRD) codes over both finite and infinite division rings. In particular, we construct new non-associative division algebras whose right nucleus is a central simple algebra having degree greater than 1. Over finite fields, we obtain new semifields and MRD codes for infinitely many choices of parameters. These families extend and contain many of the best previously known constructions.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR &gt; 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.</description>

      <title>SPEX: Scaling Feature Interaction Explanations for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized machine learning due to their ability to capture complex interactions between input features. Popular post-hoc explanation methods like SHAP provide marginal feature attributions, while their extensions to interaction importances only scale to small input lengths ($\approx 20$). We propose Spectral Explainer (SPEX), a model-agnostic interaction attribution algorithm that efficiently scales to large input lengths ($\approx 1000)$. SPEX exploits underlying natural sparsity among interactions -- common in real-world data -- and applies a sparse Fourier transform using a channel decoding algorithm to efficiently identify important interactions. We perform experiments across three difficult long-context datasets that require LLMs to utilize interactions between inputs to complete the task. For large inputs, SPEX outperforms marginal attribution methods by up to 20% in terms of faithfully reconstructing LLM outputs. Further, SPEX successfully identifies key features and interactions that strongly influence model output. For one of our datasets, HotpotQA, SPEX provides interactions that align with human annotations. Finally, we use our model-agnostic approach to generate explanations to demonstrate abstract reasoning in closed-source LLMs (GPT-4o mini) and compositional reasoning in vision-language models.</description>

      <title>A Theory for Semantic Channel Coding With Many-to-one Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the potential key technologies of 6G, semantic communication is still in its infancy and there are many open problems, such as semantic entropy definition and semantic channel coding theory. To address these challenges, we investigate semantic information measures and semantic channel coding theorem. Specifically, we propose a semantic entropy definition as the uncertainty in the semantic interpretation of random variable symbols in the context of knowledge bases, which can be transformed into existing semantic entropy definitions under given conditions. Moreover, different from traditional communications, semantic communications can achieve accurate transmission of semantic information under a non-zero bit error rate. Based on this property, we derive a semantic channel coding theorem for a typical semantic communication with many-to-one source (i.e., multiple source sequences express the same meaning), and prove its achievability and converse based on a generalized Fano's inequality. Finally, numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed semantic entropy and semantic channel coding theorem.</description>

      <title>Iterative Inversion of Ill-Conditioned MIMO Channels Using Symmetric Rank-$1$ Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While iterative matrix inversion methods excel in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and support for parallel and distributed computing when managing large matrices, their limitations are also evident in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. These methods encounter challenges related to slow convergence and diminished accuracy, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, hindering their application in future MIMO networks such as extra-large aperture array. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel matrix regularization method termed symmetric rank-$1$ regularization (SR-$1$R). The proposed method functions by augmenting the channel matrix with a symmetric rank-$1$ matrix, with the primary goal of minimizing the condition number of the resultant regularized matrix. This significantly improves the matrix condition, enabling fast and accurate iterative inversion of the regularized matrix. Then, the inverse of the original channel matrix is obtained by applying the Sherman-Morrison transform on the outcome of iterative inversions. Our eigenvalue analysis unveils the best channel condition that can be achieved by an optimized SR-$1$R matrix. Moreover, a power iteration-assisted (PIA) approach is proposed to find the optimum SR-$1$R matrix without need of eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed approach exhibits logarithmic algorithm-depth in parallel computing for MIMO precoding. Finally, computer simulations demonstrate that SR-$1$R has the potential to reduce the required iteration by up to $35\%$ while achieving the performance of regularized zero-forcing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance straggler resilience in federated learning (FL) systems, a semi-decentralized approach has been recently proposed, enabling collaboration between clients. Unlike the existing semi-decentralized schemes, which adaptively adjust the collaboration weight according to the network topology, this letter proposes a deterministic coded network that leverages wireless diversity for semi-decentralized FL without requiring prior information about the entire network. Furthermore, the theoretical analyses of the outage and the convergence rate of the proposed scheme are provided. Finally, the superiority of our proposed method over benchmark methods is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Assisted Integrated Data and Energy Transfer: Outage and Multiplexing Gain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10548v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) exploits the spatial opportunities in wireless channels to overcome multiuser interference by position (a.k.a.~port) switching, which can achieve better performance compared to traditional fixed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Additionally, integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is capable of providing both wireless data transfer (WDT) and wireless energy transfer (WET) services towards low-power devices. In this paper, a FAMA-assisted IDET system is investigated, where a base station (BS) equipped with $N$ fixed antennas provides dedicated IDET services towards $N$ user equipments (UEs). Each UE is equipped with a single fluid antenna, while the power splitting (PS) approach is conceived for coordinating WDT and WET. The outage probabilities of both WDT and WET are derived and approximated into closed-forms, where the fluid antenna (FA) at each UE selects the optimal port to achieve the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) or the energy harvesting power (EHP). The IDET outage probabilities are defined and subsequently derived and approximated into closed-forms. Further, multiplexing gains of the proposed system are defined and analyzed to evaluate the performace. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, while also illustrate that the trade-off is achieved between WDT and WET performance by exploiting different port selection strategies. Furthermore, the number of UEs should be optimized to achieve better IDET performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from direct exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha$ is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite quantum state relative to any product state. In this work, we establish several properties of this type of Renyi mutual information, including its additivity for $\alpha\in [1/2,2]$. As an application, we show that the direct exponent of certain binary quantum state discrimination problems is determined by the doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in (1/2,1)$. This provides an operational interpretation of this type of Renyi mutual information, and generalizes a previous result for classical probability distributions to the quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Theoretically Grounded Framework for LLM Watermarking: A Distribution-Adaptive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a crucial method to distinguish AI-generated text from human-created text. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for watermarking Large Language Models (LLMs) that jointly optimizes both the watermarking scheme and the detection process. Our approach focuses on maximizing detection performance while maintaining control over the worst-case Type-I error and text distortion. We characterize \emph{the universally minimum Type-II error}, showing a fundamental trade-off between watermark detectability and text distortion. Importantly, we identify that the optimal watermarking schemes are adaptive to the LLM generative distribution. Building on our theoretical insights, we propose an efficient, model-agnostic, distribution-adaptive watermarking algorithm, utilizing a surrogate model alongside the Gumbel-max trick. Experiments conducted on Llama2-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B models confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we examine incorporating robustness into our framework, paving a way to future watermarking systems that withstand adversarial attacks more effectively.</description>

      <title>Advancing Multi-Connectivity in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Architectures, Challenges, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks, especially the non-terrestrial network (NTN). The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. This article introduces three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, such as cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Subsequently, key technical challenges severely influencing the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes (including the current active VOFDM/OTFS) can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over a decade ago.</description>
