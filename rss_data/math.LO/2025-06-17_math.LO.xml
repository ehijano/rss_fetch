      <title>Nonvanishing Higher Derived Limits without $w\diamondsuit_{\omega_1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a common refinement of theorems of Bergfalk and of Casarosa and Lambie-Hanson, showing that under certain hypotheses, the higher derived limits of a certain inverse system of abelian groups $\mathbf{A}$ do not vanish. The refined theorem has a number of interesting corollaries, including the nonvanishing of the second derived limit of $\mathbf{A}$ in many of the common models of set theory of the reals and in the Mitchell model. In particular, we disprove a conjecture of Bergfalk, Hru\v{s}\'ak, and Lambie-Hanson that higher derived limits of $\mathbf{A}$ vanish in the Miller model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the vanishing of higher derived limits of the system $\mathbf{A}_\kappa$ implies the additivity of strong homology on the class of locally compact metric spaces of weight at most $\kappa$, thereby establishing a converse to a theorem of Marde\v{s}i\'c and Prasolov.</description>

      <title>A Non-Wellfounded and Labelled Sequent Calculus for Bimodal Provability Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a labelled and non-wellfounded calculus for the bimodal provability logic CS. The system is obtained by modelling the Kripke-like semantics of this logic. As in arXiv:2309.00532, we enforce the second-order property of converse wellfoundedness by using techniques from cyclic proof theory. We will prove soundness and completeness of this system with respect to the semantics and provide a primitive decision procedure together with a way to extract countermodels.</description>

      <title>The magic of tensor products of ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor products of ultrafilters have special combinatorial features closely related to Ramsey's Theorem, making them useful tools in applications. Here we first review their fundamental properties and isolate some new ones, including a characterisation of the limit superior and inferior of sequences as limits along tensor products, and an application to the Banach asymptotic density. We then prove a general result on the combinatorial structure of sets belonging to tensor products and, as a result, we obtain several characterisations of the additive properties of sets of natural numbers. Finally, we show that tensor products can be described as idempotents of an appropriate semigroup.</description>

      <title>Higher arity stability and the functional order property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-dimensional functional order property ($\text{FOP}_k$) is a combinatorial property of a $(k+1)$-partitioned formula. This notion arose in work of Terry and Wolf, which identified $\text{NFOP}_2$ as a ternary analogue of stability in the context of two finitary combinatorial problems related to hypergraph regularity and arithmetic regularity. In this paper we show $\text{NFOP}_k$ has equally strong implications in model-theoretic classification theory, where its behavior as a $(k+1)$-ary version of stability is in close analogy to the behavior of $k$-dependence as a $(k+1)$-ary version of $\text{NIP}$. Our results include several new characterizations of $\text{NFOP}_k$, including a characterization in terms of collapsing indiscernibles, combinatorial recharacterizations, and a characterization in terms of type-counting when $k=2$. As a corollary of our collapsing theorem, we show $\text{NFOP}_k$ is closed under Boolean combinations, and that $\text{FOP}_k$ can always be witnessed by a formula where all but one variable have length $1$. When $k=2$, we prove a composition lemma analogous to that of Chernikov and Hempel from the setting of $2$-dependence. Using this, we provide a new class of algebraic examples of $\text{NFOP}_2$ theories. Specifically, we show that if $T$ is the theory of an infinite dimensional vector space over a field $K$, equipped with a bilinear form satisfying certain properties, then $T$ is $\text{NFOP}_2$ if and only if $K$ is stable. Along the way we provide a corrected and reorganized proof of Granger's quantifier elimination and completeness results for these theories.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of pseudofinite and pseudo-amenable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first give simplified and corrected accounts of some results in \cite{PiRCP} on compactifications of pseudofinite groups. For instance, we use a classical theorem of Turing \cite{Turing} to give a simplified proof that any definable compactification of a pseudofinite group has an abelian connected component. We then discuss the relationship between Turing's work, the Jordan-Schur Theorem, and a (relatively) more recent result of Kazhdan \cite{Kazh} on approximate homomorphisms, and we use this to widen our scope from finite groups to amenable groups. In particular, we develop a suitable continuous logic framework for dealing with definable homomorphisms from pseudo-amenable groups to compact Lie groups. Together with the stabilizer theorems of \cite{HruAG,MOS}, we obtain a uniform (but non-quantitative) analogue of Bogolyubov's Lemma for sets of positive measure in discrete amenable groups. We conclude with brief remarks on the case of amenable topological groups.</description>

      <title>Compression of enumerations and gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the compressibility of enumerations in the context of Kolmogorov complexity, focusing on strong and weak forms of compression and their gain: the amount of auxiliary information embedded in the compressed enumeration. The existence of strong compression and weak gainless compression is shown for any computably enumerable (c.e.) set. The density problem of c.e. sets with respect to their prefix complexity is reduced to the question of whether every c.e. set is well-compressible, which we study via enumeration games.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is an amenable group and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>
