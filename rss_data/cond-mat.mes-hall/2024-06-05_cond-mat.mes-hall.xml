      <title>Geometry, anomaly, topology, and transport in Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl fermions are one of the simplest objects that link ideas in geometry and topology to highenergy physics and condensed matter physics. Although the existence of Weyl fermions as elementary particles remains dubious, there is mounting evidence of their existence as quasiparticles in certain condensed matter systems. Such systems are termed Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Needless to say, WSMs have emerged as a fascinating class of materials with unique electronic properties, offering a rich playground for both fundamental research and potential technological applications. This review examines recent advancements in understanding electron transport in Weyl semimetals (WSMs). We begin with a pedagogical introduction to the geometric and topological concepts critical to understanding quantum transport in Weyl fermions. We then explore chiral anomaly (CA), a defining feature of WSMs, and its impact on transport phenomena such as longitudinal magnetoconductance (LMC) and the planar Hall effect (PHE). The Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory extended beyond the standard relaxation-time approximation is then discussed in the context of Weyl fermions, which is used to evaluate various transport properties. Attention is also given to the effects of strain-induced gauge fields and external magnetic fields in both time-reversal broken and inversion asymmetric inhomogeneous WSMs. The review synthesizes theoretical insights, experimental observations, and numerical simulations to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex transport behaviors in WSMs, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Observation of chiral solitary waves in a nonlinear Aharonov-Bohm ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearities can have a profound influence on the dynamics and equilibrium properties of discrete lattice systems. The simple case of two coupled modes with self-nonlinearities gives rise to the rich bosonic Josephson effects. In many-site arrays, nonlinearities yield a wealth of rich phenomena, including a variety of solitonic excitations, the emergence of vortex lattices in the presence of gauge fields, and the general support of chaotic dynamics. Here, we experimentally explore a three-site mechanical ring with tunable gauge fields and nonlinearities. We observe a macroscopic self-trapping transition that is tunable by the magnetic flux, consistent with the equilibrium response. We further observe novel behavior that appears only out of equilibrium, the emergence of interaction-stabilized chiral solitary waves. These results provide a starting point to explore nonlinear phenomena arising in larger mechanical arrays coupled to static and dynamical gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Interface transparency to orbital current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of spin currents across interfaces is relatively well studied, while the transport properties of orbital currents are just starting to be examined. In Cr/Ni bilayers, the spin-orbit torque (SOT) due to the orbital current generated in the Cr layer is believed to dominate over torques of other origins. In this work, we study SOT in Cr/X/Ni trilayers, where X is an ultra-thin spacer of a different material. Using the SOT as a proxy for the orbital current transferred from the Cr to the Ni layer, we compare Cr/X/Ni results to Pt/X/Ni, the system in which spin current generated in the Pt layer plays a dominant role. We find that across 12 different spacers the apparent interface transparency to the orbital current is comparable or larger than to the spin current.</description>

      <title>Diamond molecular balance: Revolutionizing high-accuracy mass spectrometry from MDa to TDa at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of mass spectrometry lies in its unparalleled ability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in complex samples, providing invaluable insights into molecular structures and interactions. Here, we leverage diamond nanostructures as highly sensitive mass sensors by utilizing a self-excitation mechanism under an electron beam in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The diamond molecular balance (DMB) exhibits exceptional mass accuracy of a few MDa and an extensive dynamic range from MDa to TDa, positioning itself as a forefront molecular balance operating at room temperature. Notably, the DMB measures the mass of a single bacteriophage T4, achieving a mass accuracy of 4.7 MDa for an analyte at 184 MDa, while precisely determining their positional information on the device. These findings highlight the groundbreaking potential of the DMB as a revolutionary tool for mass analysis at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Brightened emission of dark trions in transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical emission spectra of semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers highlight fascinating recombination processes of charged excitons (trions). When charge tunable WSe2 monolayers are moderately doped with electrons, a strong luminescence peak emerges just below the well-understood spectral lines associated with the recombination of negatively charged bright and dark trions. Despite previous investigations, its origin remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that this luminescence peak is the result of electron-electron assisted recombination that brightens the dark trion emission. Supporting evidence for this second-order recombination process comes from identifying the equivalent brightened emission of positively charged dark trions when the monolayer is electrostatically doped with holes. Remarkably, the discovered hole-hole assisted luminescence peak emerges in the near infrared, about 500 meV below the well-studied spectral region of excitons and trions. In addition to identifying new recombination channels of these excitonic complexes, our findings accurately determine the spin-split energies of the conduction and valence bands. Both of which play crucial roles in understanding the optical properties of WSe2 based homo- and hetero-structures.</description>

      <title>Near-Room-Temperature Field-Controllable Exchange Bias in 2D van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange bias (EB) is a cornerstone of modern magnetic memory and sensing technologies. Its extension to the realm of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets holds promise for revolutionary advancements in miniaturized and efficient atomic spintronic devices. However, the blocking temperature of EB in 2D vdW magnets is currently well below room temperature ~130 K. This study reports a robust EB phenomenon in Fe3GaTe2 thin-layer devices, which significantly increases the blocking temperature to a near-room-temperature record of 280 K. Both the bias direction and magnitude can be isothermally tuned by adjusting the field sweep range, in striking contrast to the conventional EB in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) bilayers. We propose an exchange spring model in which crystal defects with higher coercivity act as the pivotal pinning source for the observed EB phenomenon, deviating from the conventional FM/AFM interface mechanism. Cumulative growth of minor loops and multiple magnetization reversal paths are observed in field cycles below the saturation field, consistent with the hard FM defects behavior of our exchange spring model. These findings provide insights into the complex magnetic order in 2D ferromagnets and open new avenues for developing practical ultrathin vdW spintronic devices with EB-like properties at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Probing the zero energy shell wave functions of triangular graphene quantum dots with broken sublattice symmetry using a localized impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a method of probing the wave functions of a degenerate shell in a triangular graphene quantum dot, triangulene, using a localized substitutional impurity. We demonstrate its applicability to the example of aza-triangulenes. Using the analytical solution for degenerate states of an all-carbon triangulene as a basis for a triangulene containing a nitrogen impurity, we predict the structure of the zero energy shell in the presence of this impurity. We show that the impurity allows probing of the wave functions of a degenerate shell on a carbon site where it is located. We confirm our predictions by a comparison with the tight-binding and ab-initio calculation as well as with experiment.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Locked Coupling of Localized Microwaves to Magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the photonic spin-orbit coupling known from nano-optics and plasmonics in the microwave regime. The transverse spin $\mathbf{S}$ and momentum $\mathbf{q}$ of microwaves emitted by an excited magnetic dot are locked by $\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{S}=0$ with a fixed chirality $\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot(\hat{\bf S}\times\hat{\bf q})=1$ when evanescent along $\hat{\mathbf{n}}\perp {\bf q}$. This field excites magnons in a nearby magnetic film in the form of directional beams that rotate with the magnetization direction. The exchange of these magnons through a magnetic substrate leads to a highly tunable strong coupling and entanglement between two distant nanomagnets.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent transport through graphene quantum dots due to proximity-induced, staggered spin-orbit couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system composed of graphene decorated with an array of islands with C_3v symmetry that induce quantum dot (IQD) regions via proximity effects and give rise to several spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). We evaluate transport properties for an array of IQDs and analyze the conditions for realizing isolated valley conductances and valley-state localization. The resulting transmission shows a square-type behavior with wide gaps that can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the staggered intrinsic SOCs. Realistic proximity effects are characterized by weak SOC strengths, and the analysis of our results in this regime shows that the Rashba coupling is the important interaction controlling valley properties. As a consequence, a top gate voltage can be used to tune the valley polarization and switch the valley scattering for positive or negative incident energies. A proper choice of SOC strengths leads to higher localization of valley states around the linear array of IQDs. These systems can be implemented in heterostructures composed of graphene and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoSe2, WSe2, MoS2, or WS2. In these setups, the magnitudes of induced SOCs depend on the twist angle, and due to broken valley degeneracy, valley-polarized currents at the edges can be generated in a controllable manner as well as localized valley states. Our findings suggest an alternative approach for producing valley-polarized currents and propose a corresponding mechanism for valley-dependent electron optics and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene hosts competing magnetic order and moir\'e inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in the magic-angle twisted graphene family, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG), is poorly understood. Properties of MATTG, like Pauli limit violation, suggest unconventional superconductivity. Theoretical studies propose proximal magnetic states in the phase diagram, but direct experimental evidence is lacking. We show direct evidence for an in-plane magnetic order proximal to the superconducting state using two complementary electrical transport measurements. First, we probe the superconducting phase by using statistically significant switching events from superconducting to the dissipative state of MATTG. The system behaves like a network of Josephson junctions due to lattice relaxation-induced moir\'e inhomogeneity in the system. We observe non-monotonic and hysteretic responses in the switching distributions as a function of temperature and in-plane magnetic field. Second, in normal regions doped slightly away from the superconducting regime, we observe hysteresis in magnetoresistance with an in-plane magnetic field; showing evidence for in-plane magnetic order that vanishes $\sim$900 mK. Additionally, we show a broadened Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition due to relaxation-induced moir\'e inhomogeneity. We find superfluid stiffness $J_{\mathrm{s}}$$\sim$0.15 K with strong temperature dependence. Theoretically, the magnetic and superconducting order arising from the magnetic order's fluctuations have been proposed - we show direct evidence for both. Our observation that the hysteretic magnetoresistance is sensitive to the in-plane field may constrain possible intervalley-coherent magnetic orders and the resulting superconductivity that arises from its fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in the rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of the rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated by virtue of the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With the help of the detailed numerical analysis, we notice that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct kinds of fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$ and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. Such fixed points principally dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime, which are always associated with some instabilities with specific symmetry breakings and thus accompanied by certain phase transitions. In order to judge the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we bring out a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, it is determined that the dominant states correspond to a spin-singlet superconductivity, a spin-triplet pair-density-wave, and a spin-triplet superconductivity for approaching the fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These results would be helpful to further reveal the low-energy properties of the rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnetic solitons, such as skyrmions, exhibit intriguing particle-like properties that make them attractive for fundamental research and practical applications. While many magnetic systems can host skyrmions as statically stable configurations, chiral magnets stand out for their ability to accommodate a wide diversity of skyrmions with arbitrary topological charges and varied morphologies. Despite extensive investigation, a complete understanding of chiral magnetic skyrmions has remained elusive. We present a classification of all chiral skyrmions, demonstrating three classes based on their response to external magnetic field pulses: stationary, translating, and rotating. We highlight the role of magnetic texture symmetry in this classification. Skyrmions with varied dynamics offer avenues for exploring phenomena like skyrmion-skyrmion scattering that might be crucial for future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetics interacting with a spin-current torque. We extend the previously constructed stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation to the case with spin-current torque, and verify the conditions of detailed balance. Then we construct various thermodynamics quantities such as work and heat, and prove the second law of thermodynamics. Due to the existence of spin-torque and the asymmetry of the kinetic matrix, a novel effect of entropy pumping shows up. As a consequence, the system may behave as a heat engine which constantly transforms heat into magnetic work. Finally, we derive a fluctuation theorem for the joint probability density function of the pumped entropy and the total work, and verify it using numerical simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative systems with decoherence free subspaces, a.k.a. dark spaces (DSs), can be used to protect quantum information. At the same time, dissipation is expected to give rise to coherent information degradation outside the DS. Employed to support quantum information platforms, DSs can be adiabatically modified in a way that resembles adiabatic control of coherent systems. Here we study the slow evolution of a purely dissipative system with a spectral gap $\gamma$, characterized by a strong symmetry, under a cyclic protocol with period $T$. Non-adiabatic corrections to the state evolution give rise to decoherence: the evolution within the instantaneous DS is described by a time-local effective Liouvillian operator that leads to purity degradation over a period, of order $1/\gamma T$. We obtain a closed form of the latter to order $1/(\gamma T)^2$. Our analysis underlines speed limitations in quantum information processing in the absence of corrective measures.</description>

      <title>Tunable $t-t'-U$ Hubbard models in twisted square homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Square lattice Hubbard models with tunable hopping ratio $t'/t$ are highly promising for realizing a variety of quantum phases and for shedding light on key puzzles in correlated quantum materials, including higher-temperature superconductivity. We show that twisted square lattice homo-bilayers generically offer such tunability when the flat bands originate from the corner of the Brillouin zone. We reveal an emergent symmetry at low twist-angles, absent in single layers, that necessitates the vanishing of nearest neighbor hopping ($t=0$). This symmetry can be lifted by an inter-layer displacement field or by an in-plane magnetic field, introducing tunable $t$ and anisotropy, allowing access to a wide range of $t'/t$ ratios for correlated electrons on a moir\'e square lattice.</description>

      <title>Inverse spin-Hall effect and spin-swapping in spin-split superconductors</title>

Abstract: When a spin-splitting field is introduced to a thin film superconductor, the spin currents polarized along the field couples to energy currents that can only decay via inelastic scattering. We study spin and energy injection into such a superconductor where spin-orbit impurity scattering yields inverse spin-Hall and spin-swapping currents. We show that the combined presence of a spin-splitting field, superconductivity, and inelastic scattering gives rise to a strong enhancement of the ordinary inverse spin-Hall effect, as well as unique inverse spin-Hall and spin-swapping signals orders of magnitude stronger than the ordinary inverse spin-Hall signal. These can be completely controlled by the orientation of the spin-splitting field, resulting in a long-range charge and spin accumulations detectable much further from the injector than in the normal-state. While the enhanced inverse spin-Hall signals offer a major improvement in spin detection sensitivity, the unique spin-swap signals can be utilized for designing devices where both the spin and current directions are controlled and altered throughout the geometry.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg machines with programmable spin-circuits</title>

Abstract: We show that we can harness two recent experimental developments to build a compact hardware emulator for the classical Heisenberg model in statistical physics. The first is the demonstration of spin-diffusion lengths in excess of microns in graphene even at room temperature. The second is the demonstration of low barrier magnets (LBMs) whose magnetization can fluctuate rapidly even at sub-nanosecond rates. Using experimentally benchmarked circuit models, we show that an array of LBMs driven by an external current source has a steady-state distribution corresponding to a classical system with an energy function of the form $E = -1/2\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} (\hat{m}_i \cdot \hat{m}_j$). This may seem surprising for a non-equilibrium system but we show that it can be justified by a Lyapunov function corresponding to a system of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations. The Lyapunov function we construct describes LBMs interacting through the spin currents they inject into the spin neutral substrate. We suggest ways to tune the coupling coefficients $J_{ij}$ so that it can be used as a hardware solver for optimization problems involving continuous variables represented by vector magnetizations, similar to the role of the Ising model in solving optimization problems with binary variables. Finally, we train a Heisenberg XOR gate based on a network of four coupled stochastic LLG equations, illustrating the concept of probabilistic computing with a programmable Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Circular motion of non-collinear spin textures in Corbino disks: Dynamics of N\'eel- versus Bloch-type skyrmions and skyrmioniums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nano-scale magnetic whirls that can be driven by currents via spin torques. They are promising candidates for spintronic devices such as the racetrack memory, where a motion along the uniform current is typically desired. However, for spin torque nano-oscillators in Corbino disks, the goal is to achieve a circular motion, perpendicular to the radially applied current. As we show, based on analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations, Bloch skyrmions engage in a circular motion with frequencies in the MHz range when driven by spin-orbit torques. In contrast, N\'eel skyrmions get stuck at the edges of the disk. Our analysis reveals that the antagonistic dynamics between Bloch- and N\'eel-type magnetic textures arise from their helicity. Furthermore, we find that skyrmioniums, which are topologically trivial variations of skyrmions, move even faster and allow an increase in the current density without being pushed toward the edges of the disk. When driven by spin-transfer torques instead, Bloch and N\'eel skyrmions no longer exhibit different dynamics. Instead, they move along a circular trajectory due to the skyrmion Hall effect caused by their topological charge. Consequently, the topologically trivial skyrmioniums inevitably become trapped at the disk edge in this scenario. To provide a comprehensive understanding, our study also examines currents applied tangentially, further enriching our insights into skyrmion dynamics and appropriate current injection methods for skyrmion-based devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Transport Measurements of Lateral p-n Junctions Formed via Precise Spatial Photodoping of Graphene/hBN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doped semiconductors are a central and crucial component of all integrated circuits. By using a combination of white light and a focused laser beam, and exploiting hBN defect states, heterostructures of hBN/Graphene/hBN are photodoped in-operando, reproducibly and reversibly. We demonstrate device geometries with spatially-defined doping type and magnitude. After each optical doping procedure, magnetotransport measurements including quantum Hall measurements are performed to characterize the device performance. In the unipolar (p+-p-p+ and n-n+-n) configurations, we observe quantization of the longitudinal resistance, proving well-defined doped regions and interfaces that are further analyzed by Landauer-Buttiker modeling. Our unique measurements and modeling of these optically doped devices reveal a complete separation of the p- and n-Landau level edge states. The non-interaction of the edge states results in an observed "insulating" state in devices with a bi-polar p-n-p configuration that is uncommon and has not been measured previously in graphene devices. This insulating state could be utilized in high-performance graphene electrical switches. These quantitative magnetotransport measurements confirm that these doping techniques can be applied to any 2D materials encapsulated within hBN layers, enabling versatile, rewritable circuit elements for future computing and memory applications.</description>

      <title>Competing multiferroic phases in monolayer and few-layer NiI$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent experiment reported type-II multiferroicity in monolayer (ML) NiI$_{2}$ based on a presumed spiral magnetic configuration (Spiral-B), which is, as we found here, under debate in the ML limit. Freestanding ML NiI$_{2}$ breaks its C$_{3}$ symmetry, as it prefers a striped antiferromagnetic order (AABB-AFM) along with an intralayer antiferroelectric (AFE) order. However, substrate confinement may preserve the C$_{3}$ symmetry and/or apply tensile strain to the ML. This leads to another spiral magnetic order (Spiral-$IV^X$), while 2L shows a different order (Spiral-$V^Y$) and Spiral-B dominates in thicker layers. Thus, three multiferroic phases, namely, Spiral-B+FE, Spiral-$IV^X$ +FE, Spiral-$V^Y$+FE, and an anti-multiferroic AABB-AFM+AFE one, show layer-thickness-dependent and geometry-dependent dominance, ascribed to competitions among thickness-dependent Kitaev, biquadratic, and Heisenberg spin-exchange interactions and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Our theoretical results clarify the debate on the multiferroicity of ML NiI$_{2}$ and shed light on the role of layer-stacking-induced changes in noncollinear spin-exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy in thickness-dependent magnetism.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. The key concepts of quantum mechanics are quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations of quantum fields confined in a finite-size system induce the zero-point energy shift. This quantum phenomenon, the Casimir effect, is one of the most striking phenomena of quantum mechanics in the sense that there are no classical analogs and has been attracting much attention beyond the hierarchy of energy scales, ranging from elementary particle physics to condensed matter physics, together with photonics. However, the non-Hermitian extension of the Casimir effect and the application to spintronics have not yet been investigated enough, although exploring energy sources and developing energy-efficient nanodevices are its central issues. Here we fill this gap. By developing a magnonic analog of the Casimir effect into non-Hermitian systems, we show that this non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons is enhanced as the Gilbert damping constant (i.e., the energy dissipation rate) increases. When the damping constant exceeds a critical value, the non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons exhibits an oscillating behavior, including a beating one, as a function of the film thickness and is characterized by the exceptional point. Our result suggests that energy dissipation serves as a key ingredient of Casimir engineering.</description>

      <title>Stability of fractional Chern insulators with a non-Landau level continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>
