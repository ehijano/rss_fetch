      <title>Why does Schr\"odinger's cat refuse to be quantic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12488</link>

Abstract: Both at formal and philosophical levels, decades of efforts have been devoted to a deciphering of the `quantum enigma', the `crazy way quantum objects behave', to quote R.P. Feynman's words. We posit that the enigma cannot recede without resorting to a thorough questioning of the quantum ontology. In the current paper this questioning is introduced through a revisitation of the famous Schr\"odinger's cat paradox, and of the main attempts at solving it. Our proposal thereof, is that the quantum world enjoys a sound physical reality (complying, in particular, with the scientifc requirement of experimental reproducibility), but also, that this physical reality calls for an enlarged, and however precise notion of `what is real', such that what is real and actual can be distinguished from what is real but potential</description>

      <title>Cournot's principle revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cournot's principle states that a typical event (i.e., an event with probability very close to $1$) occurs nearly certainly in a single trial of an experiment. This principle has been considered by various authors as the only connection between mathematical probability and the real world of experiments.
  To make its logical structure clearer, in this paper a reformulation of Cournot's principle is proposed, the main novelty of which this is the explicit introduction of $\textit{practical certainty}$ as an objective empirical property of some events. The novel formulation then states that a probability measure $P$ $\textit{governs}$ an experiment $E$ if the events that are typical according to $P$ are practically certain according to $E$, and this property is also required to hold for the $n$-fold product of $P$ and for the experiment consisting of $n$ independent trials of $E$, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
  The proposed reformulation highlights the possibility that two different probability measures govern the same experiment. However, this possibility is excluded by a theorem proven in the paper.</description>
