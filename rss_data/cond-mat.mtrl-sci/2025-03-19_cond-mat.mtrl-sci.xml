      <title>Exciton-polaritons and exciton localization from a first-principles interacting Green's function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</description>

      <title>Atomic dynamics and local structural disorder during ultrafast melting of polycrystalline Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary distinction between solid and liquid phases is mechanical rigidity, with liquids having a disordered atomic structure that allows flow. While melting is a common phase transition, its microscopic mechanisms still remain unclear. This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ultrafast melting in polycrystalline palladium, focusing on the relationship between atomic dynamics quantified by the root-mean-squared displacement (RMSD) and local structural disorder characterized by the deviation from centrosymmetry. In the crystal bulk, melting is preceded by a gradual rise in the RMSD and local disorder. As the Lindemann limit for the RMSD is approached, the increasing concentration of lattice defects is manifested by a discontinuous rise in disorder. On melting, the rise is followed by a rapid increase in displacement, indicative of atomic flow. In contrast, the grain boundaries undergo melting through a continuous increase of both the displacement and the disorder, resembling a glass transition on heating.</description>

      <title>Graphene-hBN interlayer interactions from quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.</description>

      <title>Sn-InAs nanowire shadow-defined Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in hybrid electronic devices for quantum science is driving the research into superconductor-semiconductor materials combinations. Here we study InAs nanowires coated with shells of $\beta$-Sn. The wires grow via the vapor-liquid-solid mechanism out from (001) InAs substrates along two orientations, forming a criss-crossing landscape. This allows us to define nanowire-shadow junctions during the low temperature Sn shell deposition by carefully choosing the deposition angle. We find that the Sn shells are uniform in thickness and the grains have a preferential in-plane epitaxial relationship with InAs. The interface between Sn and InAs is abrupt and we do not observe interdiffusion. In our nanowire devices, Sn induces a superconducting gap of order 600 $\mu$eV, switching currents reaching values up to 500 nA, and critical magnetic fields along the nanowire of up to 1.3 T. These characteristics can be leveraged in the design of superconducting transmon qubits, parametric microwave amplifiers as well as for the investigation of triplet and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Performance Database for Low-Temperature Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature alloys are important for a wide spectrum of modern technologies ranging from liquid hydrogen, and superconductivity to quantum technology. These applications push the limit of material performance into extreme coldness, often demanding a combination of strength and toughness to address various challenges. Steel is one of the most widely used materials in cryogenic applications. With the deployment in aerospace liquid hydrogen storage and the transportation industry, aluminum and titanium alloys are also gaining increasing attention. Emerging medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) demonstrate excellent low-temperature mechanical performance with a much-expanded space of material design. A database of low-temperature metallic alloys is collected from the literature and hosted in an open repository. The workflow of data collection includes automated extraction based on machine learning and natural language processing, supplemented by manual inspection and correction, to enhance data extraction efficiency and database quality. The product datasets cover key performance parameters including yield strength, tensile strength, elongation at fracture, Charpy impact energy, as well as detailed information on materials such as their types, chemical compositions, processing and testing conditions. Data statistics are analyzed to elucidate the research and development patterns and clarify the challenges in both scientific exploration and engineering deployment.</description>

      <title>High emissivity surfaces stable at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal radiative energy transport is essential for high-temperature energy harvesting technologies, including thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) and grid-scale thermal energy storage. However, the inherently low emissivity of conventional high-temperature materials constrains radiative energy transfer, thereby limiting both system performance and technoeconomic viability. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast femtosecond laser-material interactions to transform diverse materials into near-blackbody surfaces with broadband spectral emissivity above 0.96. This enhancement arises from hierarchically engineered light-trapping microstructures enriched with nanoscale features, effectively decoupling surface optical properties from bulk thermomechanical properties. These laser blackened surfaces (LaBS) exhibit exceptional thermal stability, retaining high emissivity for over 100 hours at temperatures exceeding 1000{\deg}C, even in oxidizing environments. When applied as TPV thermal emitters, Ta LaBS double electrical power output from 2.19 to 4.10 W cm-2 at 2200{\deg}C while sustaining TPV conversion efficiencies above 30%. This versatile, largely material-independent technique offers a scalable and economically viable pathway to enhance emissivity for advanced thermal energy applications.</description>

      <title>Reversing Neel Vector in PT-Antiferromagnets by Nonreciprocal Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics has been receiving tremendous attention due to their ultrafast kinetics, zero stray field, immune to external magnetic field, and potential to minimizing magnetic storage devices. The optical control of AFM Neel vector has become a hectic topic during recent years, which could facilitate the AFM utilization in practical systems. In this work, we propose a nonreciprocal light scattering mechanism to flip the Neel vector in parity-time (PT) combined AFM multilayers, by estimating the energy contrast between the bistable Neel polarization configurations. We illustrate our theory using a low energy kp model, and perform ab initio calculations on two typical A-type AFM materials, MnBi2Te4 and CrI3 thin films. We show that varying incident photon frequency could modulate the relative stability between the bistable Neel vector state, which also depends on the light handedness. According to this theory, our parameter-independent calculations on the Neel vector diagram shows consistent predictive results with recent experimental observations. This mechanism provides an effective route to controlling the AFM order parameter through photo-magnetic interaction.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery from Data Assisted by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge driven discovery of novel materials necessitates the development of the causal models for the property emergence. While in classical physical paradigm the causal relationships are deduced based on the physical principles or via experiment, rapid accumulation of observational data necessitates learning causal relationships between dissimilar aspects of materials structure and functionalities based on observations. For this, it is essential to integrate experimental data with prior domain knowledge. Here we demonstrate this approach by combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) data with insights derived from large language models (LLMs). By fine-tuning ChatGPT on domain-specific literature, such as arXiv papers on ferroelectrics, and combining obtained information with data-driven causal discovery, we construct adjacency matrices for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that map the causal relationships between structural, chemical, and polarization degrees of freedom in Sm-doped BiFeO3 (SmBFO). This approach enables us to hypothesize how synthesis conditions influence material properties, particularly the coercive field (E0), and guides experimental validation. The ultimate objective of this work is to develop a unified framework that integrates LLM-driven literature analysis with data-driven discovery, facilitating the precise engineering of ferroelectric materials by establishing clear connections between synthesis conditions and their resulting material properties.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Tunnel Junction Based on above-Room-Temperature Altermagnetic CrSb, Ferroelectric In2Se3 and Ferromagnetic Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered profound fascination. Their idiosyncratic electronic structures facilitate spintronics and electronics, yet room-temperature (RT) AM-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with versatile tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and tunneling electroresistance (TER) regulated by multiferroics remain uncharted frontiers. We herein construct an experiment-fabricable above-RT MTJ, comprising altermagnetic metal/ferroelectric barrier/magnetic metal epitomized by CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2. Magnetism- (Ferroelectricity-) manipulatable TER (TMR) and both approaches-controllable spin filtering are attained. Non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and vacuum layer are exploited as counterpoints to discern the roles of ferroelectric and tangible barrier, respectively. High TMR, TER and spin filtering efficiency of 1031/2308 %, 328 % and ~100 % (near-perfect) can be accomplished, respectively. Our results of the initial investigation for above-RT multiferroic AM-based MTJs avail the evolution of advanced spin transport, sensing and logic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Advances and challenges of SCAN and r2SCAN density functionals in transition-metal compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds (TMCs) with open-shell d-electrons are characterized by a complex interplay of lattice, charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom, giving rise to a diverse range of fascinating applications. Often exhibiting exotic properties, these compounds are commonly classified as correlated systems due to strong inter-electronic interactions called Hubbard U. This inherent complexity presents significant challenges to Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), the most widely used electronic structure method in condensed matter physics and materials science. While KS-DFT is, in principle, exact for the ground-state total energy, its exchange-correlation energy must be approximated in practice. The mean-field nature of KS implementations, combined with the limitations of current exchange-correlation density functional approximations, has led to the perception that DFT is inadequate for correlated systems, particularly TMCs. Consequently, a common workaround involves augmenting DFT with an on-site Hubbard-like U correction. In recent years, the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional, along with its refined variant r2SCAN, has achieved remarkable progress in accurately describing the structural, energetic, electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of TMCs, challenging the traditional perception of DFT's limitations. This review explores the design principles of SCAN and r2SCAN, highlights their key advancements in studying TMCs, explains the mechanisms driving these improvements, and addresses the remaining challenges in this evolving field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly derive the wavefunctions of chiral phonons propagating along the helical axis in chiral crystals and clarify the characteristics of electron-phonon interactions in chiral helical crystals. In particular, we elucidate how the conservation of not only the crystal momentum (CM) but also the crystal angular momentum (CAM) manifests in the interaction vertex. This formulation provides a microscopic framework for describing physical processes involving chiral phonons. Furthermore, we construct a phononic analogue of Zilch, a known measure of chirality carried by light, and discuss its relationship with phonon angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Metal-organic Pulsed Laser Deposition for Complex Oxide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point defects in complex oxide thin films play a critical role in determining material properties but remain challenging to control with precision. This study introduces metal-organic pulsed laser deposition (MOPLD) as a novel synthesis technique for the precise manipulation of these defects, using LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) as a model system. By employing titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) as the titanium precursor, MOPLD achieves refined stoichiometric control in STO layers while preserving their structural integrity, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Depth-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that increasing TTIP flux during STO growth enhances the [TiSr]/[VSr] ratio and reduces the [VO] concentration. These defect modifications lead to a significant improvement in the low-temperature mobility of the two-dimensional electron gas at the LAO/STO interface, evidenced by distinct Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This work underscores the potential of MOPLD to advance defect engineering in complex oxide heterostructures, opening new avenues for quantum material research.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Partial Order Driven by Intermolecular Interactions -- Structure and Dynamics of Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water ice's remarkable properties make it an important material across a range of disciplines. The combination of covalent and hydrogen bonds form a long-range lattice of oxygens, which hosts a disordered yet correlated hydrogen network. We observe hidden strings of 1D order within the disordered manifold of hydrogen atoms - revealed via optical phonons within a large multi-dimensional neutron scattering dataset. Our analysis shows that nearest-neighbor intermolecular interactions drive partial ordering, rather than dipole interactions, and hints at a mechanism for ice Ih's transition into ordered ice XI that may extend to other disordered phases. These insights have broader implications for non-periodic systems exhibiting local-symmetry, while enhancing our knowledge of lattice dynamics of this most intriguing material.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cooperativity on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Light-induced Spin-State Switching of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ Spin-Crossover Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly flexible bistable molecular switches with two distinct spin states that can be switched into each other by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. In the condensed phase, this spin switching phenomenon is determined not only by the chemical and structural properties of the SCO compound but also by intermolecular interactions within the SCO material and their coupling to surfaces. These interactions lead to cooperative effects in the spin switching behavior that are, for instance, reflected in the thermal hysteresis of the spin switching or determine the speed of the thermal and optical spin transition within a thin film of SCO complexes.
  In this study, we shed new light on the cooperativity-driven spatial and temporal dynamics of the collective light-induced spin switching of thin SCO films on a gold single crystal. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transition between the low-spin and high-spin light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) states of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ compound. Using real-time photoemission electron microscopy with millisecond time resolution, we uncover spectroscopic signatures of the light-induced spin state switching to the LIESST state even $200\, \mu$m outside the spot of direct optical excitation. This observation is identical for both continuous wave and femtosecond laser light excitations in the visible spectral range. The timescale of the spin-switching dynamics is indicative of a photothermal process in which molecules far from the laser spot relax back to the low-spin ground state faster than those within the directly illuminated region. All of these observations highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions in the spin state switching of the SCO thin film.</description>

      <title>Flexible manipulation of chiral spin state by chemical bond in Mn triangular lattice magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chemical bonds on the magnetic structure of materials, a less explored area compared to their effect on crystal stability. By analyzing the strength and directionality of chemical bonds using the electron localization function (ELF) and charge density difference (CDD) methods, we examine their impact on magnetic exchange interactions and magnetocrystalline anisotropy under specific interstitial conditions in Mn4X compounds. Our findings indicate that these properties can effectively modulate the magnetic ground state. This work not only elucidates the varied magnetism observed in Mn triangular lattice magnets but also proposes an approach for engineering chiral spin states through chemical bonding manipulation.</description>

      <title>Ferrotoroidal order of the monolayer ice in martyite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beauty of snowflakes, the fractal patterns with the hexagonal symmetry, reflects the crystal structure of ice. The honeycomb network of H2O molecules stacks along the perpendicular direction, composing the hexagonal crystalline ice (ice Ih phase). What can one see if one layer of ice is extracted and confined to a two-dimensional (2D) sheet? Martyite Zn3(V2O7)(OH)2 2H2O, a mineral with the honeycomb lattice of H2O in the porous framework, is an ideal system to study such monolayer ice. Due to the geometrical frustration and 2D nature of the honeycomb lattice, H2O molecules are dynamically disordered at room temperature, and the most stable molecular arrangement is nontrivial. In this study, we reveal disorder-order transitions of H2O in martyite using the single-crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The XRD results visualize the formation of hydrogen-bonded toroidal H2O hexamers, leading to the electric ferrotoroidal order below 200 K. Combined with the MD simulations, we discuss the formation process of the H2O hexamers and how they compromise the molecular arrangement towards lower temperatures. Our results unveil the ground state of monolayer ice, a fundamental knowledge to understand the polymorphism of H2O.</description>

      <title>ARPES studies of Hf(0001) surface: flat bands formation in the dice lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first electronic structure measurements of the Hf(0001) single-crystal surface using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The ARPES results are supported by theoretical calculations performed using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method and the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green function method. In addition to insight into the electronic structure of Hf(0001), our results reveal the impact of surface contamination, particularly oxygen and carbon, on the predicted surface state. Moreover, we observe a flat band induced by both, the presence of oxygen and the dice structure of the surface. The orbital texture of Hf bands is confirmed by linear dichroism studies</description>

      <title>High-efficiency computational methodologies for electronic properties and structural characterization of Ge-Sb-Te based phase change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical simulation to phase change materials such as Ge-Sb-Te has suffered from two methodology issues. On the one hand, there is a lack of efficient band gap correction method for density functional theory, which is suitable for these materials in both crystalline and amorphous phases, though the computational complexity should be kept at the local density approximation level. On the other hand, analysis of the coordination number in amorphous phases relies on an integration involving the radial distribution function, which adds to the complexity. In this work, we find that the shell DFT-1/2 method offers an overall band gap accuracy for phase change materials comparable to HSE06 hybrid functional, though its computational cost is around three orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, the mixed length-angle coordination number theory enables calculating the coordination numbers in the amorphous phase directly from the structure, with definite outcomes. The two methodologies could be helpful for high throughput simulation of phase change materials.</description>

      <title>Sustainable wafer-scale integration of epitaxial ZnO on silicon for piezoelectric devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To sustainably support the ongoing energetic transition, we need functional metal oxides capable of converting energy, and produce storage, and sensing devices. However, these materials suffer from a high economic cost of manufacturing, and their production in a sustainable way is, to date, a milestone. Additionally, the technical challenges, such as scalability and integration of silicon for industrial processing using microelectronic technologies, impose strict conditions for the entire materials process. In this work, we engineer {\alpha}-quartz virtual substrates up to 4 inches facilitating the large-scale and sustainable integration of multifunctional epitaxial ZnO metal oxide microwire films on silicon. These materials are exclusively manufactured on silicon using solution chemistry, providing single-chip solutions that can meet strict economic constraints for developing sustainable devices at a lower cost. Through this integrative technology, we demonstrate the microfabrication of epitaxial (110)ZnO/(100){\alpha}-quartz/(100)silicon piezoelectric membrane resonators at the wafer-scale with potential applications in energy conversion and sensing. We combined four dimensional (4D)-STEM diffraction technology and Piezoelectric Force Microscopy (PFM) to establish a correlation between out of plane crystalline strain and piezoelectric response in epitaxial (110) ZnO at the microscale. Finally, we proved the fabrication of 800 nm thick (110) ZnO suspended membranes that can be transferred to flexible substrates, making them suitable for flexible devices.</description>

      <title>The effect of a band gap gradient on the radiative losses in the open circuit voltage of solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative open circuit voltage loss in a solar cell occurs because the absorptance spectrum near the band gap shows gradual increase rather than sharp step function like transition. This broadening effect has been attributed to band gap fluctuations and or to Urbach tails. In this report, we use modelling based on Planck s generalized law to distinguish between these two effects. Our results demonstrate that Urbach tails have only a minimal effect on the absorptance edge broadening and clarify that even an ideal direct semiconductor with no band gap fluctuations shows broadening at the absorptance onset. Furthermore, state of the art inorganic thin film solar cells often incorporate a band gap gradient across their thickness, which can further contribute to absorptance broadening. Using Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) absorbers as a case study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of voltage losses through absolute photoluminescence and electroluminescence spectroscopy, combined with photospectrometry and high-spatial-resolution cathodoluminescence measurements. We find that the loss analysis based on the combination of radiative, generation and non-radiative losses is complete. Samples with a graded band gap profile show more pronounced broadening of the absorptance onset and up to 16 mV higher radiative losses compared to the samples with uniform band gap. There is indication, that band gap-graded samples also have larger lateral band gap inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Integrated Modeling of Thermal Properties and Relaxation Dynamics in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are a promising class of materials celebrated for their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, accurately predicting and understanding the melting temperature (T_m) and glass transition temperature (T_g) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that integrates machine learning (ML) models with theoretical methods to predict and analyze these key thermal properties in metallic glasses. Our ML models using distributional data derived from elemental composition-based features obtain high accuracy while minimizing data preprocessing complexity. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between T_m and T_g to elucidate their dependence on alloy composition and thermodynamic behavior. When the T_g value of metallic glasses is known, further analysis using the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory provides a deeper understanding of structural relaxation dynamics. This integrated framework establishes a quantitative description consistent with experimental data and previous works and paves the way for the efficient design and discovery of advanced materials with tailored thermal properties.</description>

      <title>PET-MAD, a universal interatomic potential for advanced materials modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have greatly extended the reach of atomic-scale simulations, offering the accuracy of first-principles calculations at a fraction of the effort. Leveraging large quantum mechanical databases and expressive architectures, recent "universal" models deliver qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids, systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials. PET-MAD rivals state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling, out-of-the-box, the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions. It can be efficiently fine-tuned to deliver full quantum mechanical accuracy with a minimal number of targeted calculations.</description>

      <title>Occupation deficiency in layered structures of UNi$_{x}$Sb$_2$ ($ 0 \leq x \leq 1 $) studied by density functional theory supercell calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The five crystal structures of selected UNi$_{x}$Sb$_2$ compositions are investigated by density functional theory supercell calculations. The considered phases are USb$_2$, UNi$_{0.33}$Sb$_2$, UNi$_{0.5}$Sb$_2$, UNi$_{0.66}$Sb$_2$, and UNiSb$_2$ ($x$ = 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1). The occupation deficiency of Ni is modeled by removing the Ni layers from constructed supercells, followed by relaxation of the structures. A linear dependence of the lattice parameter $c$ versus Ni concentration $x$ is observed, same, fulfilling the empirical Vegard's law. The agreement between results of our calculations with the empirical data from literature confirms the validity of our approach of supercells with empty Ni layers, at least in predicting of lattice parameters. The calculated with orbital polarization magnetic moments on uranium atoms decrease from 1.70 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ to 1.61 $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ with increasing Ni concentration $x$. In comparison to available empirical data of USb$_2$ and UNi$_{0.5}$Sb$_2$, the magnetic moments calculated with orbital polarization are less than 10% smaller.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Defect Complex Structures of PL6 in SiC: Insights from First-Principles Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC has attracted significant research attention owing to its remarkable spin and optical properties at ambient temperatures. Unlike many color centers that require cryogenic conditions to function, the PL6 center maintains optical activity even at room temperature or higher, benefiting from the material's high thermal conductivity and chemical stability. To elucidate the origin of PL6's distinctive characteristics and clarify its microscopic structure in the crystal, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation of potential defect complexes through systematic first-principles calculations. Our computational approach rigorously evaluates the electronic structures and spin-related properties of various defect configurations, enabling reasonable identification of the most probable atomic arrangement responsible for the observed characteristics of PL6. Our analysis identifies a limited set of candidate structures with ${\rm C_{3v}}$-like symmetry consistent with known experimental signatures. Among these, two defect complexes emerge as the most likely PL6 candidates. The findings suggest that targeted experimental studies, such as electron spin resonance and optically detected magnetic resonance, could further clarify the nature of the PL6 center, while additional theoretical investigations on transition matrix elements and defect formation dynamics are warranted.</description>

      <title>Curie temperature study of the Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ systems using mean-field theory and Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cubic Laves phases including YFe$_2$, YCo$_2$, ZrFe$_2$, and ZrCo$_2$ are considered as promising candidates for application in hydrogen storage and magnetic refrigeration. While YFe$_2$ and ZrFe$_2$ are ferromagnets, alloying with Co decreases magnetic moments and Curie temperatures ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of pseudobinary Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ systems, leading to the paramagnetic states of YCo$_2$ and ZrCo$_2$. The following study focus on the investigation of Curie temperature of the Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ system from first principles. To do it, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the mean field theory (MFT) based on the disordered local moments (DLM) calculations are used. The DLM-MFT results agree qualitatively with the experiment and preserve the characteristic features of $T_\mathrm{C}(x)$ dependencies for both Y(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$ and Zr(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$. However, we have encountered complications in the Co-rich regions due to failure of the local density approximation (LDA) in describing the Co magnetic moment in the DLM state. The analysis of Fe-Fe exchange couplings for YFe$_2$ and ZrFe$_2$ phases indicates that the nearest-neighbor interactions play the main role in the formation of $T_{\mathrm{C}}$.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Heat Transport in Crystalline Polymers in Real and Reciprocal Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transport can be modelled with a variety of approaches in real space (using molecular dynamics) or in reciprocal space (using the Boltzmann transport equation). Employing two conceptually different approaches of each type, we study heat transport in crystalline polyethylene and polythiophene. We find that consistent results can be obtained when using highly efficient and accurate machine-learned potentials, provided that the physical intricacies of the considered materials and methods are correctly accounted for. For polythiophene this turns out to be comparably straightforward, while for polyethylene we find that the inclusion of higher-order anharmonicities is crucial to avoid a massive overestimation of the thermal conductivity. The responsible long-lived phonons are found at relatively high frequencies between 11 THz and 16 THz. This complicates the use of classical statistics in all molecular-dynamics-based approaches.</description>

      <title>An empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics for simulating and predicting microstructure evolution in materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14294v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nos\'e-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</description>

Abstract: The thermal and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors is underpinned by their vibrational dynamics, yet surface phonons in layered materials remain poorly understood due to limitations in conventional experimental techniques. We employ helium-3 spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy to resolve the lowest energy (&lt;10 meV) dispersions of surface phonons on bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS\textsubscript{2}) with sub-meV energy resolution near $\Gamma$. We identify two low-energy optical modes, E_2g and A_1g, exhibiting unexpected quasi-acoustic dispersion, and crucially do not find evidence of an acoustic mode at the surface. A_1g follows a purely quadratic dispersion (\(\omega_{A_{1g}} \propto q^2\)), while \(E_{2g}\) displays quartic behaviour (\(\omega_{E_{2g}} \propto q^4\)), indicative of strong anharmonicity. These modes, absent in inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) measurements and theoretical predictions of the bulk, exhibit finite-layer confinement equivalent to 4.5 and 6 layers, respectively. Their rapid dispersion yields substantial group velocities at small wavevectors, suggesting a dominant role in surface and few-layer thermal transport. This work establishes optical surface phonons as key drivers of thermal management in 2D materials and highlights the necessity of understanding surface phononics for designing next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantized Magneto-Terahertz Effects in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13651v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes, concentrating photovoltaic cells and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and how this changes with respect to both the time in the excited state of the exciton and its energy. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number only rises to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophoric units that facilitates highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. Our results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is naturally difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised that control exciton-exciton annihilation.</description>

      <title>The effect of variable fibre diameters in unidirectional fibre-reinforced bundles on stress redistributions around fibre breaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite element modelling is conducted to simulate the stress redistribution around a broken fibre (BF) in a bundle with experimentally measured fibre diameter distributions (FDD), followed by a parametric study of the influence of the FDD coefficient of variation on the stress concentration factor (SCF) and ineffective length (IL). Two variants of the SCF definition are considered: based on average and maximum stress in the fibre cross-section. Results demonstrate that bigger fibre diameters show higher SCF and clustering of such fibres increases SCF in nearest neighbour fibres (NNFs). Critically, maximum stress-based SCF (maxSCF_max) significantly exceeds average stress-based SCF (maxSCF_avg), with differences about 40 to 75% in NNFs for FDD bundles compared to FCD bundles. This emphasises the necessity of prioritizing maximum stress criteria over conventional average stress models in failure predictions. The findings challenge benchmark models that rely on averaged SCF values, offering critical insights for improving accuracy in predicting fibre break propagation and composite strength.</description>

      <title>Competing Quantum Orders in 6R-TaS$_2$: Unconventional Superconductivity, Charge Order, and an Anomalous Hall Effect phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition metal dichalcogenide 6R-TaS$_{2}$ offers a natural platform for studying the interplay among charge density wave (CDW) order, superconductivity, and transport anomalies. Recent findings reveal that, in the intermediate temperature range between charge order and superconductivity, a hidden order emerges around $T^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 35 K-as evidenced by strong magnetoresistance and an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). However, the nature of the superconducting pairing, the hidden order, and their relationship with the CDW remain unclear. Using ${\mu}$SR, magnetotransport, susceptibility, and hydrostatic pressure techniques, we identify a nodal superconducting state with low superfluid density at ambient pressure, with no spontaneous magnetic order detected below $T^{*}$. This indicates that the AHE originates from the band structure rather than magnetism. Under pressures up to 2 GPa, the superfluid density rises markedly in correlation with the superconducting transition temperature, the nodal pairing shifts to a nodeless state, and the CDW onset is reduced by half. Notably, AHE is fully suppressed and magnetoresistance drops by 50${\%}$ within just 0.2 GPa, highlighting the fragility of the hidden order. These results reveal an unconventional superconducting pairing in 6R-TaS$_{2}$, competing with both CDW and hidden orders through weakened interlayer coupling and competition for the same electronic states. With a multifaceted approach, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram that reveals the intricate interplay and competition between the intertwined quantum orders in 6R-TaS$_{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable right-circularly polarized state of a two-level atomic system in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Classification of Supercooled Liquids: Critical Cooling Rates and Entropic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate supercooled liquids formed at cooling rates below and above the critical cooling rate (CCR). By analyzing the distribution of short-time averaged potential energies (DoPE) and crystallization behaviors, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes in supercooled liquids: the glass-forming regime (GFR) and the crystal-forming regime (CFR). For systems cooled below CCR (CFR), the DoPE exhibits a sharp peak, indicative of reduced configurational entropy. In contrast, liquids cooled above CCR (GFR) display a broad DoPE distribution, reflecting higher configurational entropy. These findings establish a robust classification framework for supercooled liquids. Further analysis reveals a crossover temperature (T_x) in both regimes, consistent with the freezing temperature (T_f). Near T_x, crystallization barrier-temperature relationships exhibit abrupt changes. Below T_x, CFR crystallizes marginally faster than GFR, whereas above T_x, the influence of cooling rates on crystallization rates diminishes. These results further categorize GFR and CFR into high and low-temperature sub-regimes, highlighting the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in supercooled liquids.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Wang et al. [1] reported on an unusual violation of Wiedemann-Franz law in three semimetals. We compare their observations to our observations in a variety of systems, where the apparent WF law violations in the same temperature range arise as a consequence of electron-phonon decoupling. Given the empirical similarity of their data with these cases, the most plausible explanation for the reported violation is an experimental artefact.</description>

      <title>Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14124v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.</description>

      <title>In situ vs ex situ: Comparing the structure of PNIPAM microgels at the air/water and air/solid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper addresses the vertical and lateral structure of microgels (MGs) layers at the air/water interface and the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer on solid substrates on the structure. The MGs are based on poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) networks. For studying the structure at the air/water interface specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR) allows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. The initial ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid interface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of lateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer. Notably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating the existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate surface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the air/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This indicates the formation of domains at low pressures, that approach each other and only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing results of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study clearly shows a transfer effect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: The distance between the particles decrease during LB-transfer and at high pressures ($\Pi\,&gt;\,22\,\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating small domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface characterisation approaches here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe the vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ, non-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced artefacts.</description>

      <title>In situ engineering hexagonal boron nitride in van der Waals heterostructures with selective SF6 etching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures are at the forefront in materials heterostructure engineering, offering the ultimate control in layer selectivity and capability to combine virtually any material. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), the most commonly used dielectric material, has proven indispensable in this field, allowing the encapsulation of active 2D materials preserving their exceptional electronic quality. However, not all device applications require full encapsulation but rather require open surfaces, or even selective patterning of hBN layers. Here, we report on a procedure to engineer top hBN layers within van der Waals heterostructures while preserving the underlying active 2D layers. Using a soft selective SF6 etching combined with a series of pre and post-etching treatments, we demonstrate that pristine surfaces can be exposed with atomic flatness while preserving the active layers electronic quality. We benchmark our technique using graphene encapsulated with hBN Hall bar devices. Using Raman spectroscopy combined with quantum transport, we show high quality can be preserved in etched regions by demonstrating low temperature carrier mobilities of 200,000 cm2Vs-1, ballistic transport probed through magnetic focusing, and intrinsic room temperature phonon-limited mobilities. Atomic force microscopy brooming and O2 plasma cleaning are identified as key pre-etching steps to obtaining pristine open surfaces while preserving electronic quality. The technique provides a clean method for opening windows into mesoscopic van der Waals devices that can be used for local probe experiments, patterning top hBN in situ, and exposing 2D layers to their environment for sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry-forbidden transitions in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering emission from materials with trapped molecular O$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oxygen resonant inelastic X-ray scattering has become a prominent tool for unveiling the electronic structure of solids, especially redox mechanisms in Li-rich cathode materials. A number of studies have observed a strong absorption feature at 531 eV associated with the anomalous capacity of Li-rich cathodes. The most prominent emission feature arising from absorption at 531 eV occurs at 523 eV and has been attributed to the $^3\Pi_\text{g}$ final state of molecular O$_2$. However, in many materials, this feature exhibits a secondary emission peak at a loss of 4.3 eV loss which is not seen in the spectrum of gas-phase oxygen. This study revisits the spectra of these materials and investigates transitions that are forbidden for an isolated O$_2$ molecule as a possible explanation for the secondary emission peak. A group theoretic analysis and simulation of RIXS cross-sections suggest that this feature is consistent with molecular oxygen in a low-symmetry environment owing to final states descending from the $^3\Sigma_\text{u}^+$ and $^3\Delta_\text{u}$ states of isolated O$_2$. Vibronic coupling and multi-molecule transitions are also discussed as possible mechanisms for enabling transitions to these final states even in a high-symmetry environment. These results support the assignment of the 531 eV absorption peak in these materials exclusively to molecular oxygen and suggest that in materials exhibiting the secondary emission peak, these molecules may reside in low-symmetry environments.</description>

      <title>Identifying Materials-Level Sources of Performance Variation in Superconducting Transmon Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic coupling in intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large van der Waals gap in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers an avenue to host external metal atoms that modify the ground state of these 2D materials. Here, we experimentally and theoretically address the charge correlations in a family of intercalated TMDs. While short-range charge fluctuations develop in Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_{2}$ and Fe$_{1/3}$TaS$_{2}$, long-range charge order switches-on in Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ driven by the interplay of magnetic order and lattice degrees of freedom. The magnetoelastic coupling is demonstrated in Fe$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ by the enhancement of the charge modulations upon magnetic field below T$_\mathrm{N}$, although Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) calculations predict negligible electron(spin)-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show that Co-intercalated TaS$_2$ displays a kagome-like Fermi surface, hence opening the path to engineer electronic band structures and study the entanglement of spin, charge, and spin-phonon mechanisms in the large family of intercalated TMDs.</description>

      <title>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</title>

Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests the deposition occurs via growth of the original grains. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</description>

      <title>Iterative charge equilibration for fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLP) allow to perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration (QEq) step, but the direct solution (dQEq) of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl$_3$ in water.</description>

      <title>Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: direct approach via master diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting material, exhibits complex, anisotropic diffusional characteristics and mass transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments, highlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Amorphous to Crystalline Transformation: How Cluster Aggregation Drives the Multistep Nucleation of ZIF-8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.</description>

      <title>A high-throughput ab initio study of elemental segregation and cohesion at ferritic-iron grain boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.</description>

      <title>Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07378v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using a MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in the prediction of material properties. We assume this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</description>

Abstract: We study a model for lithium (Li) electrodeposition on Li-metal electrodes that leads to dendritic pattern formation. The model comprises of a system of three coupled PDEs, taking the form of an Allen--Cahn equation, a Nernst--Planck equation and a Poisson equation. We prove existence of a weak solution and stability results for this system and present numerical simulations resulting from a finite element approximation of the system, which illustrate the dendritic nature of solutions to the model.</description>

      <title>Disorder Induced Superconductivity in TiSe_1.2S_0.8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder can be utilized as an effective parameter to probe the interplay between two long range orders such as superconductivity and charge density wave. In the present work, we report on the experimental evidence for filamentary superconductivity in polycrystalline TiSe1.2S0.8 with superconducting transition Tc ~ 7K. This is validated from magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. Strain induced dislocations, substitutional defects, and randomly distributed Ti ions (with local moments) are considered as possible sources of disorder. A detailed analysis of the temperature dependent resistivity evaluates the degree of disorder and the consequent localization effects. The findings are in striking contrast to the fact that superconductivity has not been reported in single crystals of TiSe2-xSx system. It is established that disorder serves as a stabilizing factor for the superconducting phase due to in-commensuration of the charge density wave.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the dynamic charge susceptibility near the charge density wave transition in ErTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</description>

      <title>Current Flow Mapping in Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls using Scanning NV-Magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of parallel plate capacitors, with ferroelectric lithium niobate as the dielectric layer, can be extensively and progressively modified by the controlled injection of conducting domain walls. Domain wall-based memristor devices hence result. Microstructures, developed as a result of partial switching, are complex and so simple models of equivalent circuits, based on the collective action of all conducting domain wall channels acting identically and in parallel, may not be appropriate. Here, we directly map the current density in ferroelectric domain wall memristors in-situ, by mapping Oersted fields, using nitrogen vacancy centre microscopy. Current density maps were found to directly correlate with the domain microstructure, revealing that a strikingly small fraction of the total domain wall network is responsible for the majority of the current flow. This insight forces a two order of magnitude correction to the carrier densities, previously inferred from standard scanning probe or macroscopic electrical characterisation.</description>

      <title>Coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamics and viscous thermoelectric equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</description>
