      <title>Numerical characterizations for integral dependence of graded ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R=\oplus_{m\geq 0}R_m$ be a standard graded Noetherian domain over a field $R_0$ and $I\subseteq J$ be two graded ideals in $R$ such that $0&lt;\mbox{height}\;I\leq \mbox{height}\;J &lt;d$. Then we give a set of numerical characterizations of the integral dependence of $I$ and ${J}$ in terms of certain multiplicities. A novelty of the approach is that it does not involve localization and only requires checking computable and well-studied invariants.
  In particular, we show the following: let $S=R[Y]$, $\mathsf{I} = IS$ and $\mathsf{J} = JS$ and $\bf d$ be the maximum generating degree of both $I$ and $J$. Then the following statements are equivalent.
  (1) $\overline{I} = \overline{J}$.
  (2) $\varepsilon(I)=\varepsilon(J)$ and $e_i(R[It]) = e_i(R[Jt])$ for all $0\leq i &lt;\dim(R/I)$.
  (3) $e\big(R[It]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = e\big(R[Jt]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big)$ and $e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = e\big(S[\mathsf{J}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big)$ for some integer $c&gt;{\bf d}$.
  The statement $(2)$ generalizes the classical result of Rees. The statement $(3)$ gives the integral dependence criteria in terms of the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities of certain standard graded domains over $R_0$. As a consequence of $(3)$, we also get an equivalent statement in terms of (Teissier) mixed multiplicities.
  Apart from several well-established results, the proofs of these results use the theory of density functions which was developed recently by the authors.</description>

      <title>On Golomb Topology of Modules over Commutative Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we associate a new topology to a nonzero unital module $M$ over a commutative $R$, which is called Golomb topology of the $R$-module $M$. Let $M\ $be an\ $R$-module and $B_{M}$ be the family of coprime cosets $\{m+N\}$ where $m\in M$ and $N\ $is a nonzero submodule of $M\ $such that $N+Rm=M$. We prove that if $M\ $is a meet irreducible multiplication module or $M\ $is a meet irreducible finitely generated module in which every maximal submodule is strongly irreducible, then $B_{M}\ $is the basis for a topology on $M\ $which is denoted by $\widetilde{G(M)}.$ In particular, the subspace topology on $M-\{0\}$ is called the Golomb topology of the $R$-module $M\ $and denoted by $G(M)$. We investigate the relations between topological properties of $G(M)\ $and algebraic properties of $M.\ $In particular, we characterize some important classes of modules such as simple modules, Jacobson semisimple modules in terms of Golomb topology.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Powers and Symbolic Rees Algebras of Binomial Edge Ideals of Some Classes of Block Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some properties of symbolic powers and symbolic Rees algebras of binomial edge ideals associated with some classes of block graphs. First, it is shown that symbolic powers of binomial edge ideals of pendant cliques graphs coincide with the ordinary powers. Furthermore, we see that binomial edge ideals of a generalization of these graphs are symbolic $F$-split. Consequently, net-free generalized caterpillar graphs are also a class of block graphs with symbolic $F$-split binomial edge ideals. Finally, it turns out that symbolic Rees algebras of binomial edge ideals associated with these two classes, namely pendant cliques graphs and net-free generalized caterpillar graphs, are strongly $F$-regular.</description>

      <title>Radical factorization in higher dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of radical factorization from almost Dedekind domain to strongly discrete Pr\"ufer domains; we show that, for a fixed subset $X$ of maximal ideals, the finitely generated ideals with $\mathcal{V}(I)\subseteq X$ have radical factorization if and only if $X$ contains no critical maximal ideals with respect to $X$. We use these notions to prove that in the group $\mathrm{Inv}(D)$ of the invertible ideals of a strongly discrete Pr\"ufer domains is often free: in particular, we show it when the spectrum of $D$ is Noetherian or when $D$ is a ring of integer-valued polynomials on a subset over a Dedekind domain.</description>

      <title>Enumerative and planar combinatorics of trivariate monomial resolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.09963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The canonical sylvan resolution is a resolution of an arbitrary monomial ideal over a polynomial ring that is minimal and has an explicit combinatorial formula for the differential. The differential is a weighted sum over lattice paths of weights of chain-link fences, which are sequences of faces that are linked to each other via higher-dimensional analogues of spanning trees. Along a lattice path in the three-variable case, these weights can be condensed to a single weight contributing to the combinatorial formula for the differential that bypasses any computation of chain-link fences. The main results in this paper express the sylvan matrix entries for monomial ideals in three variables as a sum over lattice paths of simpler weights that depend only on the number of specific Koszul simplicial complexes that lie along the corresponding lattice path. Certain entries have numerators equal to the number of lattice paths in $\mathbb{N}^2$ that follow specific restrictions.</description>

      <title>A Jacobian criterion for nonsingularity in mixed characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.01996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a version of the usual Jacobian characterization of the defining ideal of the singular locus in the equal characteristic case: the new theorem is valid for essentially affine algebras over a complete local algebra over a mixed characteristic discrete valuation ring. The result makes use of the minors of a matrix that includes a row coming from the values of a $p$-derivation. To study the analogue of modules of differentials associated with the mixed Jacobian matrices that arise in our context, we introduce and investigate the notion of a perivation, which may be thought of, roughly, as a linearization of the notion of $p$-derivation. We also develop a mixed characteristic analogue of the positive characteristic $\Gamma$-construction, and apply this to give additional nonsingularity criteria.</description>

      <title>On converse of the Schur's theorem for nilpotent Lie superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a converse to Schur's theorem for Lie superalgebras \( L \), focusing on cases where the minimal generator number pairs \((p \vert q)\) of \( L/Z(L) \) are considered, and where the superdimension \( \mathrm{sdim} L^{2} \) is finite. We introduce a new invariant \( st(L) \), which plays a key role in the classification of finite-dimensional nilpotent Lie superalgebras. Specifically, we classify the structure of all such Lie superalgebras \( L \) when \( st(L) \in \{(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (0,2), (1,1)\} \).</description>

      <title>Invertibility in partially ordered nonassociative rings and in Hausdorff Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings endowed with an ordered ring valued seminorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, (nonassociative) rings can be endowed with an extra ''structure'' such as order and topology allowing more richness in the theory. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of partially ordered nonassociative rings \textit{and} Hausdorff sequentially Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered nonassociative ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a suitably generalized concept of seminorm from a nonassociative ring to a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. Part of the assumption of the second theorem is that of Hausdorff sequential Cauchy-completeness of the first ring under the topology induced by the seminorm $f$ (which takes values in a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology). Frink's interval topology is an example of a coarse locally-convex $T_1$ topology. Moreover, to our knowledge, the topology induced by a seminorm into a partially ordered nonassociative ring has never been introduced. Some additional original facts, such as the fact that the topology on a nonassociative ring $R_1$ induced by a norm into a totally ordered associative division ring $R_2$ endowed with Frink's interval topology (or equivalently, with the order topology, since the order of $R_2$ is total) is a Hausdorff locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional separate continuity property of the product, are dealt with in the second section ''Preliminaries''.</description>

      <title>The stable category of monomorphisms between (Gorenstein) projective modules with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let (S; n) be a commutative noetherian local ring and let w in n be non-zero divisor. This paper is concerned with the two categories of monomorphisms between finitely generated (Gorenstein) projective S-modules, such that their cokernels are annihilated by w. It is shown that these categories, which will be denoted by Mon(w;P) and Mon(w; G), are both Frobenius categories with the same projective objects. It is also proved that the stable category Mon(w;P) is triangle equivalent to the category of D-branes of type B, DB(w), which has been introduced by Kontsevich and studied by Orlov. Moreover, it will be observed that the stable categories Mon(w;P) and Mon(w; G) are closely related to the singularity category of the factor ring R = S/(w). Precisely, there is a fully faithful triangle functor from the stable category Mon(w; G) to Dsg(R), which is dense if and only if R (and so S) are Gorenstein rings. Particularly, it is proved that the density of the restriction of this functor to Mon(w;P), guarantees the regularity of the ring S.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the behaviour of a free conic-line arrangement with respect to the deletion, respectively addition, of a smooth conic. Along the way we derive some restrictions on the geometry of the conic-line arrangement, induced by the freeness property. We show the same behaviour with respect to the deletion-addition of a smooth conic extends to general free reduced curves in the complex projective plane.</description>
