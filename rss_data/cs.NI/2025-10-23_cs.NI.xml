      <title>Enabling Reconfiguration-Communication Overlap for Collective Communication in Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective communication (CC) is widely adopted for large-scale distributed machine learning (DML) training workloads. DML's predictable traffic pattern provides a great oppotunity for applying optical network technology. Existing optical interconnects-based CC schemes adopt ``one-shot network reconfiguration'', which provisions static high-capacity topologies for an entire collective operation -- sometimes for a full training iteration. However, this approach faces significant scalability limitations when supporting more complex and efficient CC algorithms required for modern workloads: the ``one-shot'' strategies either demand excessive resource overprovisioning or suffer performance degradation due to rigid resource allocation.
  To address these challenges, we propose SWOT, a demand-aware optical network framework. SWOT employs ``intra-collective reconfiguration'' and can dynamically align network resources with CC traffic patterns. SWOT incorporates a novel scheduling technique that overlaps optical switch reconfigurations with ongoing transmissions, and improves communication efficiency. SWOT introduce a lightweight collective communication shim that enables coordinated optical network configuration and transmission scheduling while supporting seamless integration with existing CC libraries. Our simulation results demonstrate SWOT's significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>On the Power Saving in High-Speed Ethernet-based Networks for Supercomputers and Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in computation and storage has led to a significant growth in the scale of systems powering applications and services, raising concerns about sustainability and operational costs. In this paper, we explore power-saving techniques in high-performance computing (HPC) and datacenter networks, and their relation with performance degradation. From this premise, we propose leveraging Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE), with the flexibility to extend to conventional Ethernet or upcoming Ethernet-derived interconnect versions of BXI and Omnipath.
  We analyze the PerfBound proposal, identifying possible improvements and modeling it into a simulation framework. Through different experiments, we examine its impact on performance and determine the most appropriate interconnect. We also study traffic patterns generated by selected HPC and machine learning applications to evaluate the behavior of power-saving techniques.
  From these experiments, we provide an analysis of how applications affect system and network energy consumption. Based on this, we disclose the weakness of dynamic power-down mechanisms and propose an approach that improves energy reduction with minimal or no performance penalty. To our knowledge, this is the first power management proposal tailored to future Ethernet-based HPC architectures, with promising results.</description>

      <title>RailS: Load Balancing for All-to-All Communication in Distributed Mixture-of-Experts Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19262v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models introduces sparse and highly imbalanced all-to-all communication that dominates iteration time. Conventional load-balancing methods fail to exploit the deterministic topology of Rail architectures, leaving multi-NIC bandwidth underutilized. We present RailS, a distributed load-balancing framework that minimizes all-to-all completion time in MoE training. RailS leverages the Rail topology's symmetry to prove that uniform sending ensures uniform receiving, transforming global coordination into local scheduling. Each node independently executes a Longest Processing Time First (LPT) spraying scheduler to proactively balance traffic using local information. RailS activates N parallel rails for fine-grained, topology-aware multipath transmission. Across synthetic and real-world MoE workloads, RailS improves bus bandwidth by 20%--78% and reduces completion time by 17%--78%. For Mixtral workloads, it shortens iteration time by 18%--40% and achieves near-optimal load balance, fully exploiting architectural parallelism in distributed training.</description>

      <title>LAPRAD: LLM-Assisted PRotocol Attack Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be hard to detect.
  LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM (GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation). Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and effectiveness.
  Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to produce a similar effect.
  These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush, circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.</description>

      <title>CommonSense: Efficient Set Intersection (SetX) Protocol Based on Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the set reconciliation (\textsf{SetR}) problem, two parties Alice and Bob, holding sets $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$, communicate to learn the symmetric difference $\mathsf{A} \Delta \mathsf{B}$. In this work, we study a related but under-explored problem: set intersection (\textsf{SetX})~\cite{Ozisik2019}, where both parties learn $\mathsf{A} \cap \mathsf{B}$ instead. However, existing solutions typically reuse \textsf{SetR} protocols due to the absence of dedicated \textsf{SetX} protocols and the misconception that \textsf{SetR} and \textsf{SetX} have comparable costs. Observing that \textsf{SetX} is fundamentally cheaper than \textsf{SetR}, we developed a multi-round \textsf{SetX} protocol that outperforms the information-theoretic lower bound of \textsf{SetR} problem. In our \textsf{SetX} protocol, Alice sends Bob a compressed sensing (CS) sketch of $\mathsf{A}$ to help Bob identify his unique elements (those in $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$). This solves the \textsf{SetX} problem, if $\mathsf{A} \subseteq \mathsf{B}$. Otherwise, Bob sends a CS sketch of the residue (a set of elements he cannot decode) back to Alice for her to decode her unique elements (those in $\mathsf{A \setminus B}$). As such, Alice and Bob communicate back and forth %with a set membership filter (SMF) of estimated $\mathsf{B \setminus A}$. Alice updates $\mathsf{A}$ and communication repeats until both parties agrees on $\mathsf{A} \cap \mathsf{B}$. On real world datasets, experiments show that our $\mathsf{SetX}$ protocol reduces the communication cost by 8 to 10 times compared to the IBLT-based $\mathsf{SetR}$ protocol.</description>

      <title>Transmit What You Need: Task-Adaptive Semantic Communications for Visual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communications have drawn great attention as the groundbreaking concept surpasses the limited capacity of Shannon's theory. Specifically, semantic communications probably become crucial in realizing visual tasks that demand massive network traffic. Although highly distinctive forms of visual semantics exist for computer vision tasks, a thorough investigation of what visual semantics can be transmitted in time and which one is required for completing different visual tasks has not yet been reported. To this end, we first scrutinize the achievable throughput in transmitting existing visual semantics through the limited wireless communication bandwidth. In addition, we further demonstrate the resulting performance of various visual tasks for each visual semantic. Based on the empirical testing, we suggest a task-adaptive selection of visual semantics is crucial for real-time semantic communications for visual tasks, where we transmit basic semantics (e.g., objects in the given image) for simple visual tasks, such as classification, and richer semantics (e.g., scene graphs) for complex tasks, such as image regeneration. To further improve transmission efficiency, we suggest a filtering method for scene graphs, which drops redundant information in the scene graph, thus allowing the sending of essential semantics for completing the given task. We confirm the efficacy of our task-adaptive semantic communication approach through extensive simulations in wireless channels, showing more than 45 times larger throughput over a naive transmission of original data.

      <title>Starlink in Northern Europe: A New Look at Stationary and In-motion Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starlink has introduced the Flat High Performance (FHP) terminal, specifically designed to support the vehicles and the vessels in motion as well as the high-demand stationary users. The research on FHP terminal throughput analysis remains limited, only a few existing studies evaluate FHP, focusing on the limited parameters and scenarios. This paper evaluates the FHP terminal's performance in Finland, Northern Europe. We examine round-trip time (RTT), uplink, and downlink throughput for both stationary and in-motion use. We measure network efficiency across six geographically diverse servers and get insights of network routing strategies. Our results show that Starlink provides high-speed, low-RTT connectivity, however, the throughput experiences fluctuations with slight degradation when in motion. Additionally, we compare Starlink and terrestrial network RTT and possible routing paths.</description>

      <title>Survey of Graph Neural Network for Internet of Things and NextG Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices coupled with 6G pushing towards higher data rates and connected devices has sparked a surge in data. Consequently, harnessing the full potential of data-driven machine learning has become one of the important thrusts. In addition to the advancement in wireless technology, it is important to efficiently use the resources available and meet the users' requirements. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for effectively modeling and extracting insights which inherently exhibit complex network structures due to its high performance and accuracy, scalability, adaptability, and resource efficiency. There is a lack of a comprehensive survey that focuses on the applications and advances GNN has made in the context of IoT and Next Generation (NextG) networks. To bridge that gap, this survey starts by providing a detailed description of GNN's terminologies, architecture, and the different types of GNNs. Then we provide a comprehensive survey of the advancements in applying GNNs for IoT from the perspective of data fusion and intrusion detection. Thereafter, we survey the impact GNN has made in improving spectrum awareness. Next, we provide a detailed account of how GNN has been leveraged for networking and tactical systems. Through this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to learn more about GNN in the context of wireless networks, and understand its state-of-the-art use cases while contrasting to other machine learning approaches. Finally, we also discussed the challenges and wide range of future research directions to further motivate the use of GNN for IoT and NextG Networks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ContraWiMAE, Wireless Contrastive Masked Autoencoder, a transformer-based foundation model that unifies masked reconstruction and masked contrastive learning for wireless channel representation. Our key innovation is a new wireless-inspired contrastive objective that exploits the inherent characteristics of wireless environment, including noise, fading, and partial observability, as natural augmentation. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios and conditions, we demonstrate our method's effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including cross-frequency beam selection, line-of-sight detection, and channel estimation. ContraWiMAE exhibits superior linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and competitive performance compared with supervised baselines under challenging conditions. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning. To foster further work in this direction, we release the model weights and training pipeline for ContraWiMAE.</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Generative AI for Real-time Wireless Prediction in Dynamic Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.</description>

      <title>Forward to Hell? On the Potentials of Misusing Transparent DNS Forwarders in Reflective Amplification Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DNS infrastructure is infamous for facilitating reflective amplification attacks. Various countermeasures such as server shielding, access control, rate limiting, and protocol restrictions have been implemented. Still, the threat remains throughout the deployment of DNS servers. In this paper, we report on and evaluate the often unnoticed threat that derives from transparent DNS forwarders, a widely deployed, incompletely functional set of DNS components. Transparent DNS forwarders transfer DNS requests without rebuilding packets with correct source addresses. As such, transparent forwarders feed DNS requests into (mainly powerful and anycasted) open recursive resolvers, which thereby can be misused to participate unwillingly in distributed reflective amplification attacks. We show how transparent forwarders raise severe threats to the Internet infrastructure. They easily circumvent rate limiting and achieve an additional, scalable impact via the DNS anycast infrastructure. We empirically verify this scaling behavior up to a factor of 14. Transparent forwarders can also assist in bypassing firewall rules that protect recursive resolvers, making these shielded infrastructure entities part of the global DNS attack surface.</description>
