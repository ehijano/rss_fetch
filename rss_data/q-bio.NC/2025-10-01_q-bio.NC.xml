      <title>Neural Receptive Fields, Stimulus Space Embedding and Effective Geometry of Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how neuronal dynamics couple with stimuli space and how receptive fields emerge and organize within brain networks remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Several models attempted to explain these phenomena, often by adjusting the network to empirical manifestations, but struggled to achieve biological plausibility. Here, we propose a physiologically grounded model in which receptive fields and population-level attractor dynamics emerge naturally from the effective hyperbolic geometry of scale-free networks. In particular, we associate stimulus space with the boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, and study the resulting neural dynamics in both rate-based and spiking implementations. The resulting localized attractors faithfully reflect the structure of the stimulus space and capture key properties of the receptive fields without fine-tuning of local connectivity, exhibiting a direct relation between a neuron's connectivity degree and the corresponding receptive field size. The model generalizes to stimulus spaces of arbitrary dimensionality and scale, encompassing various modalities, such as orientation and place selectivity. We also provide direct experimental evidence in support of these results, based on analyses of hippocampal place fields recorded on a linear track. Overall, our framework offers a novel organizing principle for receptive field formation and establishes a direct link between network structure, stimulus space encoding, and neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Spatialized Brain-Body-Environment System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain-body-environment framework studies adaptive be- havior through embodied and situated agents, emphasizing interactions between brains, biomechanics, and environmen- tal dynamics. However, many models often treat the brain as a network of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), neglecting finer spatial properties which can not only increase model complexity but also constrain observable neural dy- namics. To address this limitation, we propose a spatially ex- tended approach using partial differential equations (PDEs) for both the brain and body. As a case study, we revisit a pre- viously developed model of a child swinging, now incorpo- rating spatial dynamics. By considering the spatio-temporal properties of the brain and body, we analyze how input loca- tion and propagation along a PDE influence behavior. This approach offers new insights into the role of spatial organiza- tion in adaptive behavior, bridging the gap between abstract neural models and the physical constraints of embodied sys- tems. Our results highlight the importance of spatial dynam- ics in understanding brain-body-environment interactions.</description>

      <title>Structural Heterogeneity of the Drosophila Brain Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the heterogeneity of biological neural systems is key to understanding the nervous system's complex dynamical behaviors. This study analyzes the comprehensive Drosophila brain connectome, which is the most recent data set, containing over 130,000 neurons and 50 million synapses. We conducted meticulous analyses of both network and spatial structure. Our findings reveal significant heterogeneity in network properties and distinct spatial clustering across functional regions. Besides, our analysis revealed a modular organizational pattern within the neural network, wherein regions with similar functions exhibited higher connection densities, forming distinct community structures. Moreover, we observed spatial clustering within functional regions but was not statistically significant. Additionally, we identify pervasive bilateral symmetry in network topology and spatial organization. Simulations based on the Kuramoto model demonstrate that the functional asymmetry between cerebral hemispheres arises from disparities in the intrinsic frequencies of neurons rather than from structural asymmetry within the neural network itself. Finally, we develop a 3D connectome visualization tool for detailed mapping of neuronal morphology. These insights advance our understanding of neural network organization and complexity in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature Review of EEG in Education: Learning Concepts, Computational Methods, and Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Application of electroencephalography (EEG) in educational research has grown substantially, yet a comprehensive integration of methodological frameworks, educational constructs, computational methods, and research gaps remains limited. This study applies a Bibliometric-enhanced Systematic Literature Review (BenSLR) to provide a systematic overview of EEG in education. Literature was extracted from Scopus, screened, and analyzed, with keyword co-occurrence evaluated using VOSviewer and emerging trends visualized through an Enhanced Strategic Diagram via BiblioPlot. Key findings include engagement, attention, and learning style as prominent constructs, with machine learning and deep learning frequently employed for modeling complex cognitive states. EEG signal processing, feature extraction, and assessment of cognitive and affective states were recurrent across studies. Innovative interventions such as virtual reality and neurofeedback demonstrate EEG's role in supporting adaptive and individualized learning experiences. Challenges remain in linking neural markers with observable learning behaviors, extending measurements beyond attention and working memory, and enhancing predictive model generalizability. The study demonstrates BenSLR's potential to integrate qualitative and quantitative perspectives and offers a transferable approach for other research areas to develop methodologies and evidence-based educational interventions.</description>

      <title>A Chaotic Dynamics Framework Inspired by Dorsal Stream for Event Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensor that encode visual information with high dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and low latency.Current state-of-the-art event stream processing methods rely on end-to-end deep learning techniques. However, these models are heavily dependent on data structures, limiting their stability and generalization capabilities across tasks, thereby hindering their deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a chaotic dynamics event signal processing framework inspired by the dorsal visual pathway of the brain. Specifically, we utilize Continuous-coupled Neural Network (CCNN) to encode the event stream. CCNN encodes polarity-invariant event sequences as periodic signals and polarity=changing event sequences as chaotic signals. We then use continuous wavelet transforms to analyze the dynamical states of CCNN neurons and establish the high-order mappings of the event stream. The effectiveness of our method is validated through integration with conventional classification networks, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the N-Caltech101 and N-CARS datasets, with results of 84.3% and 99.9%, respectively. Our method improves the accuracy of event camera-based object classification while significantly enhancing the generalization and stability of event representation.

      <title>Coexistence of two adaptation processes in a visuomotor rotation task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor adaptation is a learning process that enables humans to regain proficiency when sensorimotor conditions are sustainably altered. Many studies have documented the properties of motor adaptation, yet the underlying mechanisms of motor adaptation remain imperfectly understood. In this study, we propose a computational analysis of adaptation to a visuomotor rotation task and examine it through an experiment. Our analysis suggests that two distinct processes contribute to produce adaptation: one which straightens trajectories, and another which redirects trajectories. We designed a visuomotor rotation task in a 3D virtual environment where human participants performed a pointing task using a head-mounted display controller represented by a cursor that was visually rotated by an angular deviation relative to its actual position. We observed that: (1) the trajectories were initially curved and misdirected, and became straighter and better directed with learning; (2) the straightening process occurred faster than the redirection process. These findings are consistent with our computational analysis and disclose a new and different perspective on motor adaptation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Suboptimality: Resource-Rationality and Task Demands Shape the Complexity of Perceptual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early theories of perception as probabilistic inference propose that uncertainty about the interpretation of sensory input is represented as a probability distribution over many interpretations -- a relatively complex representation. However, critics argue that persistent demonstrations of suboptimal perceptual decision-making indicate limits in representational complexity. We contend that suboptimality arises not from genuine limits, but participants' resource-rational adaptations to task demands. For example, when tasks are solvable with minimal attention to stimuli, participants may neglect information needed for complex representations, relying instead on simpler ones that engender suboptimality. Across three experiments, we progressively reduced the efficacy of resource-rational strategies on a carefully controlled decision task. Model fits favored simple representations when resource-rational strategies were effective, and favored complex representations when ineffective, suggesting that perceptual representations can be simple or complex depending on task demands. We conclude that resource-rationality is an epistemic constraint for experimental design and essential to a complete theory of perception.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dimensionality of Neural Representations from Finite Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality, is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings, including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting the finite samples appropriately.</description>

      <title>Personalized Detection of Stress via hdrEEG: Linking Neuro-markers to Cortisol, HRV, and Self-Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chronic stress is a risk factor for cognitive decline and illness, yet reliable individual markers remain limited. We tested whether two single channel high dynamic range EEG biomarkers, ST4 and T2, index stress responses by linking neural activity to validated physiological and subjective measures.
  Study 1 included 101 adults between 22 and 82 years of age who completed questionnaires on stress, resilience, and burnout, provided salivary cortisol, and performed resting, cognitive load, emotional, and startle conditions. Study 2 included 82 adults between 19 and 42 years who completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, underwent heart rate variability monitoring, and performed auditory, stress inducing, and emotional conditions. Correlations were considered meaningful when r was at least 0.30. Results showed that ST4 reflected physiological arousal and cognitive strain. In Study 1, resting ST4 was positively related to cortisol and lower in more resilient participants. In Study 2, ST4 correlated negatively with heart rate variability during stress and recovery. T2 reflected emotional and autonomic regulation. In Study 1, T2 tracked higher cortisol and was lower with greater resilience. In Study 2, T2 was higher with trait anxiety and correlated negatively with heart rate variability during stress and emotional conditions. Together, ST4 and T2 provide complementary portable markers of stress, supporting individualized assessment in clinical and real world contexts.</description>

      <title>A physical approach to qualia and the emergence of conscious observers in qualia space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose that qualia are physical because they are directly observable, and revisit the contentious link between consciousness and quantum measurements from a new perspective -- one that does not rely on observers or wave function collapse but instead treats physical measurements as fundamental in a sense resonant with Wheeler's it-from-bit. Building on a mathematical definition of measurement space in physics, I reinterpret it as a model of qualia, effectively equating the measurement problem of quantum mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness. The resulting framework falls within panpsychism, and offers potential solutions to the combination problem. Moreover, some of the mathematical structure of measurement spaces, taken for granted in physics, needs justification for qualia, suggesting that the apparent solidity of physical reality is deeply rooted in how humans process information.</description>
