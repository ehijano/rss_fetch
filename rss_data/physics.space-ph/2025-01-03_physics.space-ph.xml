      <title>Magnetic Field Data Calibration with Transformer Model Using Physical Constraints: A Scalable Method for Satellite Missions, Illustrated by Tianwen-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</description>

      <title>Performance Variance of Low Noise Resonant Capacitance Bridges While Replacing their Ungapped MnZn Ferrite Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision AC resonant capacitance bridges, with a planar printed circuit board transformer using an ungapped MnZn ferrite core, have shown excellent noise performance in high-precision measurements. As many applications use an ensemble of bridges, consistency of performance is critical to the functionality of the systems. If part of the same manufacturing batch and scaled to the same frequency, the noise performance of the ferrite cores at 293 K has a weighted mean variance of &lt;0.3%, with all the cores within a +/- 1% band. At 140 K the weighted mean variance is &lt;0.6% and the 90% inclusion band is +/- 1.5%. Ten cores of SIFERRIT Material N41, from TDK Ferrites Accessories, were tested at room temperature, 293 K, and in a liquid nitrogen dewar at 140 K. Fitted to a parabolic function, to + 3dB on both frequency sides, the weighted mean of the noise minima at 293 K was 0.3027 aF/rtHz, with a variance of 0.0012 aF/rtHz spanning a frequency range of 85.0 +/- 2.7 kHz. Scaled to 100 kHz, the weighted mean and variance were 0.2788 aF/rtHz and 0.0008 aF/rtHz. Corresponding noise values at 140 K were 0.1815 aF/rtHz with a variance of 0.0016 aF/rtHz for the range of 152.7 +/- 6.3 kHz, and 0.1835 aF/rtHz with a variance of 0.0011 aF/rtHz when scaled to 150 kHz. Scaled for resonant frequency and temperature these results are consistent with a previous measurement of another ungapped core (same supplier and type, different manufacturing batch) to within 9% and 6% at 293 K and 140 K respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalar, Vector Perturbations and Effective Hawking Radiation of Cylindrical Black Holes in $f(\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates scalar perturbations and quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with cylindrical black holes constructed within the frameworks of $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity and Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) gravity. Moreover, we study the modified Hawking radiation in these black hole solutions and analyze the effects of coupling constants. These modified theories, which extend general relativity by introducing higher-order curvature corrections and additional geometric terms, provide a rich platform for exploring deviations from standard gravitational physics. The study begins by revisiting the cylindrical black holes in these modified gravity theories, where the effective cosmological constants respectively, are represented by $\Lambda_m^{f(\mathcal{R})}$ and $\Lambda_m^{\mathcal{RI}}$ related to the coupling constants unique to each framework. Afterwards, the QNMs, intrinsic damped oscillations of the black hole space-time, are analyzed to probe the stability of the system, with the effective potential $V$ revealing the impact of the modified gravity parameters. Additionally, the thermodynamic properties of the black holes are examined through the lens of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation. The GUP-modified Hawking temperature and entropy are derived, demonstrating significant deviations from classical results and highlighting the quantum gravitational effects in these modified frameworks. By linking QNMs, thermodynamics, and quantum corrections, this work not only deepens the understanding of modified gravity theories but also offers potential observational pathways to test their validity.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Space Weather Event of 1872 February: Sunspots, Magnetic Disturbance, and Auroral Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review observations of solar activity, geomagnetic variation, and auroral visibility for the extreme geomagnetic storm on 1872 February 4. The extreme storm (referred to here as the Chapman-Silverman storm) apparently originated from a complex active region of moderate area (\approx 500 {\mu}sh) that was favorably situated near disk center (S19{\deg} E05{\deg}). There is circumstantial evidence for an eruption from this region at 9--10 UT on 1872 February 3, based on the location, complexity, and evolution of the region, and on reports of prominence activations, which yields a plausible transit time of \approx29 hr to Earth. Magnetograms show that the storm began with a sudden commencement at \approx14:27 UT and allow a minimum Dst estimate of {\pounds} -834 nT. Overhead aurorae were credibly reported at Jacobabad (British India) and Shanghai (China), both at 19{\deg}.9 in magnetic latitude (MLAT) and 24{\deg}. 2 in invariant latitude (ILAT). Auroral visibility was reported from 13 locations with MLAT below |20|{\deg} for the 1872 storm (ranging from |10{\deg}. 0|--|19{\deg}. 9| MLAT) versus one each for the 1859 storm (|17{\deg}. 3| MLAT) and the 1921 storm (|16.{\deg}2| MLAT). The auroral extension and conservative storm intensity indicate a magnetic storm of comparable strength to the extreme storms of 1859 September (25{\deg}.1 \pm 0{\deg}.5 ILAT and -949 \pm 31 nT) and 1921 May (27{\deg}.1 ILAT and -907 \pm 132 nT), which places the 1872 storm among the three largest magnetic storms yet observed.</description>

      <title>Electromotive field in space and astrophysical plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of electromotive field appears in various applications in space and astrophysical plasmas. A review is given on the electromotive field highlighting our current understanding of the theoretical picture and the spacecraft observations in interplanetary space. The electromotive field is a key concept to successfully close the set of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic equations and also to construct a more complete picture of space plasma turbulence. Applications to astrophysical cases (Earth magnetosphere, heliospheric shocks, interstellar medium, and relativistic jets) are also briefly introduced, as well.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Energetics of Resistive, Thermally Conductive, and Radiative Plasma in Coronal Current Sheets due to Asymmetric External Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymmetric interaction of wave-like velocity perturbation with a coronal current sheet (CS) in the presence of resistivity, thermal conduction (TC) and radiative cooling (RC). We analyze the dynamics and energetics of CS in four cases, namely, (i) no energy loss, (ii) TC only, (iii) RC only and, (iv) TC+RC. Before fragmentation, thinning and elongation of the CS are found to be identical in all four cases and therefore independent of presence or absence of energy loss effects. Onset times, corresponding Lundquist numbers and aspect ratios suggest that TC advances the onset of fragmentation while RC has the opposite effect in comparison to absence of energy losses. Reconnection takes place at a higher rate in presence of TC and TC+RC in the tearing unstable CS. The speed of plasmoids are also found to be higher under the effect of TC and TC+RC. In presence of TC and TC+RC, average density becomes higher within the tearing unstable CS than in other two cases. As expected, estimated average temperature is increasing with highest and lowest rate in absence of energy losses and in presence of both TC and RC respectively. After the onset of fragmentation, the rate of decrement of average magnetic energy density and increment of average kinetic energy density becomes higher in presence of TC and TC+RC than in other two cases. Thus we conclude that presence of energy loss mechanisms critically influence the dynamics, energetics, and plasmoid formation within a reconnecting coronal CS.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Geoeffective CMEs Using SOHO Images and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of machine learning to the study of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impacts on Earth has seen significant growth recently. Understanding and forecasting CME geoeffectiveness is crucial for protecting infrastructure in space and ensuring the resilience of technological systems on Earth. Here we present GeoCME, a deep-learning framework designed to predict, deterministically or probabilistically, whether a CME event that arrives at Earth will cause a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is defined as a disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere during which the minimum Dst index value is less than -50 nT. GeoCME is trained on observations from the instruments including LASCO C2, EIT and MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), focusing on a dataset that includes 136 halo/partial halo CMEs in Solar Cycle 23. Using ensemble and transfer learning techniques, GeoCME is capable of extracting features hidden in the SOHO observations and making predictions based on the learned features. Our experimental results demonstrate the good performance of GeoCME, achieving a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.807 and a true skill statistics score of 0.714 when the tool is used as a deterministic prediction model. When the tool is used as a probabilistic forecasting model, it achieves a Brier score of 0.094 and a Brier skill score of 0.493. These results are promising, showing that the proposed GeoCME can help enhance our understanding of CME-triggered solar-terrestrial interactions.</description>

      <title>Probing exoplanetary magnetism via atomic alignment effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic fields of exoplanets affect the structure of their atmospheres and plasmaspheres and, therefore, the observational manifestations of transit absorptions. This work proposes a new method for constraining the presence or absence of relatively weak magnetic fields. The method is based on the quantum effect of atomic alignment of the lower energy level resulting in changing the absorption probabilities of individual transitions of multiplets from the equilibrium 2J+1 value. It appears to be sensitive to fields above ~0.001 G. We applied this method to some available transit observations of exoplanets and demonstrate that we indeed have the possibility to constrain the intrinsic magnetic field of some exoplanets right now. However, more precise and repetitive measurements, which might be available in near future, are needed for definite conclusions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-parallel anti-sunward propagating whistler waves associated to the electron-deficit in the near-Sun solar wind: Particle-in-Cell simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-situ observations of the solar wind have shown that the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) consists of a quasi-Maxwellian core, comprising most of the electron population, and two sparser components: the halo, which are suprathermal and quasi-isotropic electrons, and an escaping beam population, the strahl. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SO) observations have added one more ingredient to the known non-thermal features, the deficit-a depletion in the sunward region of the VDF, already predicted by exospheric models but never so extensively observed. By employing Particle-in-Cell simulations, we study electron VDFs that reproduce those typically observed in the inner heliosphere and investigate whether the electron deficit may contribute to the onset of kinetic instabilities. Previous studies and in-situ observations show that strahl electrons drive oblique whistler waves unstable, which in turn scatter them. As a result, suprathermal electrons can occupy regions of phase space where they fulfil resonance conditions with the parallel-propagating whistler wave. The suprathermal electrons lose kinetic energy, resulting in the generation of unstable waves. The sunward side of the VDF, initially depleted of electrons, is gradually filled, as this wave-particle interaction process, triggered by the depletion itself, takes place. Our findings are compared and validated against current PSP and SO observations: among others, our study provides a mechanism explaining the presence in the heliosphere of regularly observed parallel anti-sunward whistler waves; suggests why these waves are frequently observed in concomitant with distributions presenting an electron deficit; describes a non-collisional heat flux regulating process.</description>
