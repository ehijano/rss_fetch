      <title>Evolution of chirality from transverse wobbling in $^{135}$Pr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is a distinct signature that characterizes triaxial shapes in nuclei. We report the first observation of chirality in the nucleus $^{135}$Pr using a high-statistics Gammasphere experiment with the $^{123}$Sb($^{16}$O,4n)$^{135}$Pr reaction. Two chiral-partner bands with the configuration $\pi(1h_{11/2})^1\otimes \nu(1h_{11/2})^{-2}$ have been identified in this nucleus. Angular distribution analyses of the $\Delta I = 1$ connecting transitions between the two chiral partners have revealed a dominant dipole character. Quasiparticle triaxial rotor model calculations are in good agreement with the experiment. This is the first time that both signatures of triaxiality--chirality and wobbling--have been observed in the same nucleus.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the excitation of the low-lying $^{181\text{m}}$Ta isomer in optical laser-generated plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitation of the $^{181\text{m}}$Ta isomer in the laser-plasma scenario was claimed to have been observed more than two decades ago. However, the reported experimental findings - and the respective high excitation rate - were later questioned as they could not be reproduced theoretically. The controversy has remained open ever since. In this work, we reinvestigate both theoretically and experimentally the $^{181\text{m}}$Ta nuclear excitation in an optical laser-generated plasma. Experimentally we have found no evidence for such an excitation process as consistently predicted by previous and our theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Photoneutron cross section measurements on $^{208}$Pb in the Giant Dipole Resonance region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoneutron reactions on $^{208}$Pb in the Giant Dipole Resonance energy region have been investigated at the $\gamma$-ray beam line of the NewSUBARU facility in Japan. The measurements made use of quasi-monochromatic laser Compton backscattering $\gamma$-ray beams in a broad energy range, from the neutron threshold up to 38 MeV, and of a flat-efficiency moderated $^3$He neutron detection system along with associated neutron-multiplicity sorting methods. We report absolute cross sections and mean photoneutron energies for the $^{208}$Pb$(\gamma,\,inX)$ reactions with $i$~=~1 to 4. The fine structure present in the $^{208}$Pb$(\gamma,\,n)$ cross sections at incident energies lower than 13~MeV has been observed. The photoabsorption cross section has been obtained as the sum of the $(\gamma,\,inX)$ reaction cross sections. By reproducing the measured ring-ratio values at excitation energies below the two neutron separation energy, we were able to extract estimations on the $^{208}$Pb$(\gamma,\,n)$ photoneutron energy spectra and on the partial photoneutron cross sections for leaving the residual $^{207}$Pb in its ground and first two excited states. The present results are compared with data from the literature and statistical model calculations.</description>

      <title>New insights on fission of 235U induced by high energy neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{235}$U(n,f) reaction cross section was measured relative to neutron-proton elastic scattering for the first time in the energy region from 10 MeV to 440 MeV at the CERN n\_TOF facility. Two independent detection systems were used simultaneously to extract the fission cross section. For neutron energies below 200 MeV, the present results agree within one standard deviation with the data available in literature and are well reproduced by the IAEA evaluation. Above 200 MeV, the comparison of model calculations to the present data indicates the need to introduce a transient time in the description of the neutron-induced fission process in order to allow the simultaneous description of (n,f) and (p,f) reactions.</description>

      <title>Systematic shell-model study of structure and isomeric states in $^{204-213}$Bi isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have performed systematic shell-model calculations for Bi isotopes with $A=$ 204-213 using KHH7B and KHM3Y effective interactions. We have reported yrast and non-yrast shell-model states corresponding to the available experimental data. From the comparison with the experimental data, we could assign spin and parity of several unconfirmed states. We have also calculated electromagnetic properties and compared them with the available experimental data and predicted where experimental data are not available. This study also includes a detailed discussion of multiple isomeric states based on computed shell-model configurations and their respective half-lives.</description>

      <title>Development of neutron beamline for laser-driven neutron resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress of laser science provides laser-driven neutron source (LDNS), which has remarkable features such as the short pulse width. One of the key techniques to be developed for more efficient use of the LDNS is neutron collimation tubes to increase the number of neutrons arriving at a detector in the time-of-flight method. However, when a tube with a thick wall is used as a collimator the neutron collection efficiency at the detector increases but the time resolution becomes wider because of multiple scattering inside of the tube. In the present study, we have developed a collimation tube made of Ni-0, which is optimized for the increased neutron collection efficiency and a reasonable time resolution. This collimator has been demonstrated experimentally using neutron resonance spectroscopy with neutrons provided from LFEX laser.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis of the $\beta - \bar{\nu_e}$ Angular Correlation Measurement from the aSPECT Experiment with New Constraints on Fierz Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the basis of revisions of some of the systematic errors, we reanalyzed the electron-antineutrino angular correlation ($a$ coefficient) in free neutron decay inferred from the recoil energy spectrum of the protons which are detected in 4$\pi$ by the aSPECT spectrometer. With $a = -0.10402(82)$ the new value differs only marginally from the one published in 2020. The experiment also has sensitivity to $b$, the Fierz interference term. From a correlated $(b,a)$ fit to the proton recoil spectrum, we derive a limit of $b = -0.0098(193)$ which translates into a somewhat improved 90 \% CL region of $-0.041 \leq b \leq 0.022$ on this hypothetical term. Tighter constraints on $b$ can be set from a combined$^{(c)}$ analysis of the PERKEO~III ($\beta$ asymmetry) and aSPECT measurement which suggests a finite value of $b$ with $b^{(c)}$ = -0.0181 $\pm$ 0.0065 deviating by 2.82$\sigma$ from the standard model.</description>

      <title>High-precision mass measurements of neutron deficient silver isotopes probe the robustness of the $N$ = 50 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision mass measurements of exotic $^{95-97}$Ag isotopes close to the $N = Z$ line have been conducted with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer, with the silver ions produced using the recently commissioned inductively-heated hot cavity catcher laser ion source at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line facility. The atomic mass of $^{95}$Ag was directly determined for the first time. In addition, the atomic masses of $\beta$-decaying 2$^+$ and 8$^+$ states in $^{96}$Ag have been identified and measured for the first time, and the precision of the $^{97}$Ag mass has been improved. The newly measured masses, with a precision of $\approx$ 1 keV/c$^2$, have been used to investigate the $N =$ 50 neutron shell closure confirming it to be robust. Empirical shell-gap and pairing energies determined with the new ground-state mass data are compared with the state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} calculations with various chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians. The precise determination of the excitation energy of the $^{96m}$Ag isomer in particular serves as a benchmark for \textit{ab initio} predictions of nuclear properties beyond the ground state, specifically for odd-odd nuclei situated in proximity to the proton dripline below $^{100}$Sn. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and configuration-interaction shell-model (CISM) calculations are compared with the experimental results. All theoretical approaches face challenges to reproduce the trend of nuclear ground-state properties in the silver isotopic chain across the $N =$50 neutron shell and toward the proton drip-line.</description>

      <title>Electroproduction of the Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperons at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2 in forward angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, the E12-17-003 experiment was conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) to explore the possible existence of an nnLambda state in the reconstructed missing mass distribution from a tritium gas target [K. N. Suzuki et al., Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2022, 013D01 (2022), B. Pandey et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, L051001 (2022)]. As part of this investigation, data was also collected using a gaseous hydrogen target, not only for a precise absolute mass scale calibration but also for the study of Lambda/Sigma^0 electroproduction. This dataset was acquired at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2, W=2.14 GeV, and theta_{gamma K}^{c.m.}~8 deg. It covers forward angles where photoproduction data is scarce and a low-Q^2 region that is of interest for hypernuclear experiments. On the other hand, this kinematic region is at a slightly higher Q^2 than previous hypernuclear experiments, thus providing crucial information for understanding the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross sections for Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperon electroproduction. This paper reports on the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross section for the e + p -&gt; e' + K^+ + Lambda/Sigma^0 reaction in the 0.2-0.8 (GeV/c)^2, and provides comparisons with the currently available theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Extraction of the Parton Momentum-Fraction Dependence of Generalized Parton Distributions from Exclusive Photoproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $x$ dependence of hadrons' generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $\mathcal{F}(x,\xi,t)$ is the most difficult to extract from the existing known processes, while the $\xi$ and $t$ dependence are uniquely determined by the kinematics of the scattered hadron. We study the single diffractive hard exclusive processes for extracting GPDs in the photoproduction. We demonstrate quantitatively the enhanced sensitivity on extracting the $x$ dependence of various GPDs from the photoproduction cross sections, as well as the asymmetries constructed from photon polarization and hadron spin that could be measured at JLab Hall D by GlueX Collaboration and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-introduce, in light of our modern understanding of neutrinos, the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X\to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>
