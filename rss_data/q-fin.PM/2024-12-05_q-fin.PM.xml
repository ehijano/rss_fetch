      <title>MILLION: A General Multi-Objective Framework with Controllable Risk for Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio management is an important yet challenging task in AI for FinTech, which aims to allocate investors' budgets among different assets to balance the risk and return of an investment. In this study, we propose a general Multi-objectIve framework with controLLable rIsk for pOrtfolio maNagement (MILLION), which consists of two main phases, i.e., return-related maximization and risk control. Specifically, in the return-related maximization phase, we introduce two auxiliary objectives, i.e., return rate prediction, and return rate ranking, combined with portfolio optimization to remit the overfitting problem and improve the generalization of the trained model to future markets. Subsequently, in the risk control phase, we propose two methods, i.e., portfolio interpolation and portfolio improvement, to achieve fine-grained risk control and fast risk adaption to a user-specified risk level. For the portfolio interpolation method, we theoretically prove that the risk can be perfectly controlled if the to-be-set risk level is in a proper interval. In addition, we also show that the return rate of the adjusted portfolio after portfolio interpolation is no less than that of the min-variance optimization, as long as the model in the reward maximization phase is effective. Furthermore, the portfolio improvement method can achieve greater return rates while keeping the same risk level compared to portfolio interpolation. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Turnover of investment portfolio via covariance matrix of returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An investment portfolio consists of $n$ algorithmic trading strategies, which generate vectors of positions in trading assets. Sign opposite trades (buy/sell) cross each other as strategies are combined in a portfolio. Then portfolio turnover becomes a non linear function of strategies turnover. It rises a problem of effective (quick and precise) portfolio turnover estimation. Kakushadze and Liew (2014) shows how to estimate turnover via covariance matrix of returns. We build a mathematical model for such estimations; prove a theorem which gives a necessary condition for model applicability; suggest new turnover estimations; check numerically the preciseness of turnover estimations for algorithmic strategies on USA equity market.</description>
