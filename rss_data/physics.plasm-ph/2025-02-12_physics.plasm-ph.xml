      <title>Pashen-Back effect for plasma diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of determining the magnitude of neutral atom density in hydrogen plasma was investigated using Paschen-Back effect and resonant Faraday rotation of the polarization plane of light by residual neutral atoms in the plasma. In strong magnetic fields when the Zeeman shift is greater than the distance of the hyperfine structure energy levels the Paschen-Back effect is observed. In this case, it is no longer possible to speak about the independence of the splitting of each level of a given multiplet term.</description>

      <title>A least Action principle for visco-resistive Hall Magnetohydrodynamic with metriplectic reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new variational formulation for Viscous and resistive Hall Magnetohydrodynamic. We first find a variational principle for ideal HMHD by applying the physical assumptions leading to HMHD at the lagrangian level, and then we add the viscous and resistive terms by the means of constrained variations. We also provide a metriplectic reformulation of our formulation, based on two canonical Lie-Poisson brackets for the ideal part and metric 4-brackets for the dissipative part.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Recirculation Flow Pattern Induced by Nanosecond Discharges and Criterion for its Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium plasmas generated by spark discharges induce chemical, thermal, and flow dynamic effects that are beneficial in many applications such as plasmalysis, plasma-assisted combustion, and plasma flow control. Among the flow dynamic effects generated by these discharges, vorticity is of particular interest because it enhances the mixing of the discharge products with the surrounding environment and accelerates the cooling of the kernel. This article provides a comprehensive examination of the vorticity produced by nanosecond discharges in air. Using computational fluid dynamic simulations of the blast wave resulting from energy deposition in the interelectrode volume during the nanosecond pulse, we analyze the various sources of vorticity during the post-discharge period. The non-uniform strength of the leading shock of the blast wave is found to be the primary promoter of vorticity. Other sources, such as the barocline torque, play a secondary role in explaining the overall recirculation pattern. In addition, the discharge cooling mechanisms are also investigated. The cooling regimes and their efficiencies are classified according to the discharge parameters, such as the inter-electrode gap, the initial kernel temperature, or the frequency of repetitive pulses. Finally, a physics-based, non-dimensional number PI* , equal to the ratio of the initial kernel temperature to the ambient temperature, is introduced. A numerical analysis shows that the transition between the recirculating and non-recirculating flow regimes occurs for PI* on the order of 10. This criterion is validated against experimental and numerical results from the literature.</description>

      <title>New Plasma Sheath Potential Solutions in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading edges of hypersonic vehicles can reach temperatures greater than 2000 {\deg}C, and radii of curvature smaller than 1 cm, at which thermionic emission (also known as electron transpiration) can play a significant role in cooling the leading edge alongside other heat transfer modes such as convection and radiation. Existing theoretical analyses of thermionic cooling with space-charge effects at a leading edge are limited to one-dimensional (1D), analytical and numerical models that do not capture the influences of geometric curvature of the leading edge or temperature gradients along the leading edge. The key to understanding space-charge effects is development of the plasma sheath potential, and to that end we demonstrate a generalized methodology to calculate the sheath potential space in one-dimensional Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems. We accomplish this by extending Takamura's approach beyond the Cartesian system, and motivate sheath formation conditions for potential sheathes with and without a virtual cathode similar in nature to how Bohm originally presented his criterion of minimum Mach number for a valid 1D Cartesian sheath. By observing for what parameter inputs we satisfy the sheath formation conditions, we illustrate parameter spaces of minimum Mach number, potential derivative at the wall, and net current, for each coordinate system and for two different input work functions; we also show example potential spaces for each coordinate system. With our numerical approach, generalized to multiple coordinate systems, we enable computationally efficient and higher fidelity analysis of thermionic emission with space-charge effects for more realistic system geometries.</description>

      <title>Numerical Model of Thermionic- and Photo- emission Electron Heat Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermionic emission has been exploited to give rise to the theory of thermionic cooling also known as electron transpiration cooling, which can potentially serve as a powerful and engineerable cooling mode for hypersonic leading edges that can reach temperatures exceeding 2000 {\deg}C. However, the contribution to this cooling mode by photoexcited electrons remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present a numerical model of thermionic emission and photoemission driven cooling and heat spreading, examining the trajectories of electrons emitted based on a random energy model within a prescribed potential space. By simulating surfaces with two different temperature gradients, and imposing potential spaces derived for Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems, we demonstrate that heat spreading can be significant for temperature gradients on a length scale comparable to the electron spreading distance. Additionally, by testing two different leading edge radii, we find that heat spreading affects a larger percentage of surface area for a smaller leading edge radius.</description>

      <title>5D Neural Surrogates for Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Simulations of Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade plasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma scenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental machines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically is extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge, making it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies. In this work, we propose a method for training neural surrogates for 5D gyrokinetic simulations. Our method extends a hierarchical vision transformer to five dimensions and is trained on the 5D distribution function for the adiabatic electron approximation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately infer downstream physical quantities such as heat flux time trace and electrostatic potentials for single-step predictions two orders of magnitude faster than numerical codes. Our work paves the way towards neural surrogates for plasma turbulence simulations to accelerate deployment of commercial energy production via nuclear fusion.</description>

      <title>Planar Coil Optimization for the Eos Stellarator using Sparse Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenge in the design of stellarators for confining plasma at conditions relevant to fusion energy generation is designing a feasible set of magnetic field coils which can create the necessary confining field. One active direction of investigation involves the creation of a set of simplified planar coils to approximate the desired magnetic field, split between large plasma encircling coils which generate the majority of the field and small shaping coils near the plasma surface which correct remaining errors in the field geometry. The problem of optimizing currents in these coils is inherently ill-posed due to the Biot-Savart Law. In this work, the problem of optimizing the current distribution of the shaping coils is posed as a sparse regression to minimize coil count while targeting $B_n = \langle\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n}\rangle$, a metric of confinement quality, as a least-squares objective. The goal is to improve manufacturability and conductor efficiency by using fewer coils at higher currents. Using an ensemble of sparse optimization algorithms such as LASSO, relax-and-split, and heuristic methods, Pareto fronts between coil sparsity and $B_n$ properties are identified. Differences between the optimization algorithms are evaluated, demonstrating up to 20% reductions in mean $B_n$ at the same sparsity compared to a previously used heuristic method. The perturbation sensitivity of the sparse solutions to manufacturing misalignment is also evaluated. The results from the study demonstrate the potential and diversity of sparse optimization strategies in stellarator coil design problems.</description>

      <title>Ion acceleration from micrometric targets immersed in an intense laser field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental study of proton acceleration by intense laser irradiation of micrometric bar targets, whose dimensions are transversely immersed in the laser focal volume and longitudinally smaller than half its wavelength. Using only 120 mJ of laser energy, we recorded proton energies in excess of 6 MeV, exceeding those reported with any other experimental method by a factor of 3. 3D particle-in-cell simulations revealed that the efficient energy transfer from the diffracted laser fields to electrons on both sides of the target, combined with its reduced surface area, results in a thicker electron sheath and higher accelerating electric field gradients. We demonstrated numerically how this ion acceleration technique opens up the possibility of laser ion acceleration in multiple stages, allowing manipulation of the accelerated ion spectrum by optical means.</description>

      <title>Higher-order moment convergent method in weakly anisotropic plasma and the NLVFP code for solution of the 0D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusion plasma and space plasma are typical non-equilibrium and nonlinear systems, with the interactions between different species well described by the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equations. The transport of mass, momentum, energy, and temperature relaxation are important issues, which are affected by the collision term of VFP even in so-called collisionless plasma domain. Hence, nonlinearity and collisions are important features in large regime. A successful numerical simulation for non-equilibrium plasma has to be able to conserve mass, momentum and energy, while satisfying Boltzmann's H-theorem and higher-order moment convergence. An expansion of the distribution function in spherical harmonics (Legendre basis when the velocity space exhibits axisymmetry) in angle coordinate and in King basis in speed coordinate of velocity space is well suited to address these requirements. This paper reviews the formulation of the 0D-2V VFP equation in terms of spherical harmonics coupled with King function and its solution in our NLVFP code. In this topic review, we will introduce the background physics related to the nonlinear VFP simulation, then describe NLVFP for 0D-2V homogeneous, weakly anisotropic plasma with utilization of the Shkarofsky's form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FPRS) collision operator.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library (petsc.org).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the separation of matter and antimatter driven by the growth of the Weibel instability in a matter-antimatter plasma. The plasma under consideration comprises protons and antiprotons initially at rest, along with a relativistic stream of leptons (electrons and positrons). This stream is maintained by an external force, potentially originating from phenomena such as a photon wind. Our findings reveal the rapid onset of a Weibel-type instability, leading to a distinct separation of matter and antimatter. Results from our particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are compared with an analytical model based on the linearized magnetohydrodynamics equations.</description>

      <title>Numerical study on wave attenuation via 2D fully kinetic electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation and absorption of electromagnetic waves in plasma is one of the fundamental issues in plasma physics. The electromagnetic particle-in-cell method with the finite-difference time-domain solver plus Monte Carlo collision model would be the most accurate method to simulate the wave-plasma interaction. However, the numerical effects of this method have not been carefully investigated especially in two dimensions. In this paper, the 2D PIC method is used to study the electromagnetic wave attenuation by fluorescent lamp plasma tubes. The study finds that the number of macro-particles and the incident electromagnetic wave amplitude have minor effects on the wave attenuation within a certain appropriate parameter range. Furthermore, the effects of electromagnetic wave frequency, the plasma distribution structures, and collision types on wave attenuation are investigated. Particularly, it is found that the staggered way of arranging the plasma distribution structures can achieve better wave attenuation than the parallel way, which agrees with our recent experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme allowing coherent shaping, i.e., controlling both the amplitude and phase, of attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the Wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production and control of phase-stable pulse trains using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source II.</description>

Abstract: We present a pioneering model of the interaction between the solar wind and the surrounding interstellar medium that includes the possibility of different pressures in directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. The outer heliosheath region is characterized by a low rate of turbulent scattering that would permit development of pressure anisotropy. The effect is best seen on the interstellar side of the heliopause, where a narrow region develops with an excessive perpendicular pressure resembling a plasma depletion layer typical of planetary magnetspheres. The magnitude of this effect for typical heliospheric conditions is relatively small owing to proton-proton collisions. We show, however, that if the circumstellar medium is warm and tenuous, a much broader anisotropic boundary layer can exist, with a dominant perpendicular pressure in the southern hemisphere and a dominant parallel pressure in the north.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for the Analysis of Traced Particles in Kinetic Plasma Simulations</title>

Abstract: Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.</description>
