      <title>Hardness and Approximation Schemes for Discrete Packing and Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present polynomial-time approximation schemes based on local search} technique for both geometric (discrete) independent set (\mdis) and geometric (discrete) dominating set (\mdds) problems, where the objects are arbitrary radii disks and arbitrary side length axis-parallel squares. Further, we show that the \mdds~problem is \apx-hard for various shapes in the plane. Finally, we prove that both \mdis~and \mdds~problems are \np-hard for unit disks intersecting a horizontal line and axis-parallel unit squares intersecting a straight line with slope $-1$.</description>

      <title>Flexible and Probabilistic Topology Tracking with Partial Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a flexible and probabilistic framework for tracking topological features in time-varying scalar fields using merge trees and partial optimal transport. Merge trees are topological descriptors that record the evolution of connected components in the sublevel sets of scalar fields. We present a new technique for modeling and comparing merge trees using tools from partial optimal transport. In particular, we model a merge tree as a measure network, that is, a network equipped with a probability distribution, and define a notion of distance on the space of merge trees inspired by partial optimal transport. Such a distance offers a new and flexible perspective for encoding intrinsic and extrinsic information in the comparative measures of merge trees. More importantly, it gives rise to a partial matching between topological features in time-varying data, thus enabling flexible topology tracking for scientific simulations. Furthermore, such partial matching may be interpreted as probabilistic coupling between features at adjacent time steps, which gives rise to probabilistic tracking graphs. We derive a stability result for our distance and provide numerous experiments indicating the efficacy of our framework in extracting meaningful feature tracks.</description>

      <title>A PTAS for Travelling Salesman Problem with Neighbourhoods Over Parallel Line Segments of Similar Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Travelling Salesman Problem with Neighbourhoods (TSPN) on the Euclidean plane ($\mathbb{R}^2$) and present a Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) when the neighbourhoods are parallel line segments with lengths between $[1, \lambda]$ for any constant value $\lambda \ge 1$. In TSPN (which generalizes classic TSP), each client represents a set (or neighbourhood) of points in a metric and the goal is to find a minimum cost TSP tour that visits at least one point from each client set. In the Euclidean setting, each neighbourhood is a region on the plane. TSPN is significantly more difficult than classic TSP even in the Euclidean setting, as it captures group TSP. A notable case of TSPN is when each neighbourhood is a line segment. Although there are PTASs for when neighbourhoods are fat objects (with limited overlap), TSPN over line segments is APX-hard even if all the line segments have unit length. For parallel (unit) line segments, the best approximation factor is $3\sqrt2$ from more than two decades ago [DM03]. The PTAS we present in this paper settles the approximability of this case of the problem. Our algorithm finds a $(1 + \epsilon)$-factor approximation for an instance of the problem for $n$ segments with lengths in $ [1,\lambda] $ in time $ n^{O(\lambda/\epsilon^3)} $.</description>
