      <title>Geometric Bloch oscillations and transverse displacement in flat band systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate transport phenomena and dynamical effects in flat bands where the band dispersion plays no role. We show that wavepackets in geometrically non-trivial flat bands can display dynamics when inhomogeneous electric fields are present. This dynamics is revealed both for the wavepacket trajectory and for its variance, for which we derive semiclassical equations extended to the non-Abelian case. Our findings are tested in flat band models in one- and two-dimensional lattices where the dynamics is solely determined by geometric effects, in the absence of band dispersion. In particular, in the one-dimensional case, we show the existence of Bloch oscillations for the wavepacket position and for the wavepacket variance, whereas in the two-dimensional case we observe a transverse displacement of the wavepacket in the absence of Berry curvature. This work paves the way for understanding quantum-geometry-induced dynamical effects in flat band materials and also opens the possibility for their observation with synthetic matter platforms.</description>

      <title>Emergent gravity and gravitational lensing in quantum materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent gravity gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Chern insulators in two and three dimensions: A global perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a second-quantized continuum model for bulk Chern insulators wherein the Hamiltonian features a static magnetic field that has the periodicity of the crystal's lattice and spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry even in the electronic ground state at zero temperature. The topological invariants characterizing the bulk band structure of Chern insulators in both two and three dimensions are written entirely in terms of the quantities in this Hamiltonian and are globally defined across the Brillouin zone. We discuss the symmetry properties of these systems, including the discrete symmetries in the "tenfold way" classification scheme, inversion symmetry, and gauge transformations. We also study the long-wavelength response of Chern insulators to both static and finite-frequency electric fields in the linear regime, using an expression for the conductivity tensor that was derived in recent work. And we discuss how our global expressions for the Chern invariants are modified when electron spin is considered.</description>

      <title>Correlating Superconducting Qubit Performance Losses to Sidewall Near-Field Scattering via Terahertz Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating dielectric losses, structural heterogeneity, and interface imperfections is critical for improving coherence in superconducting qubits. However, most diagnostics rely on destructive electron microscopy or low-throughput millikelvin quantum measurements. Here, we demonstrate noninvasive terahertz (THz) nano-imaging/-spectroscopy of encapsulated niobium transmon qubits, revealing sidewall near-field scattering that correlates with qubit coherence. We further employ a THz hyperspectral line scan to probe dielectric responses and field participation at Al junction interfaces. These findings highlight the promise of THz near-field methods as a high-throughput proxy characterization tool for guiding material selection and optimizing processing protocols to improve qubit and quantum circuit performance.</description>

      <title>Buried unstrained Ge channels: a lattice-matched platform for quantum technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge and Si strained quantum wells have enabled the most advanced spin-qubit quantum processors, but they are deposited on defective, metamorphic SiGe substrates, which may impact device performance and scaling. Here we introduce an alternative platform, based on a heterojunction between unstrained Ge and a strained SiGe barrier, which is lattice-matched to a Ge substrate. In a structure with a 52-nm-thick strained SiGe barrier, we demonstrate a low-disorder two-dimensional hole gas with a high-mobility of 1.33$\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$/Vs and a low percolation density of 1.4(1)$\times$10$^1$$^0$ cm$^-$$^2$. Quantum transport measurements show that confined holes have a strong density-dependent in-plane effective mass and out-of-plane $g$-factor, pointing to a significant heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in agreement with theory. The expected strong spin-orbit interaction, possibility of isotopic purification, and ability to host superconducting pairing correlations make this platform appealing for fast quantum hardware and hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Kondo effect under arbitrary spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo effect originates from the spin exchange scattering of itinerant electrons with a localized magnetic impurity. Here, we consider generalization of Weyl-type electrons with their spin locked on a spherical Fermi surface in an arbitrary way and study how such spin-momentum locking affects the Kondo effect. After introducing a suitable model Hamiltonian, a simple formula for the Kondo temperature is derived with the second-order perturbation theory, which proves to depend only on the spin averaged over the Fermi surface. In particular, the Kondo temperature is unaffected as long as the average spin vanishes, but decreases as the average spin increases in its magnitude, and eventually vanishes when the spin is completely polarized on the Fermi surface, illuminating the role of spin-momentum locking in the Kondo effect.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that clearly indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable spectrum and charge dispersion mitigation in a graphene superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the energy spectrum of quantum-coherent superconducting circuits, i.e. the energies of excited states, the circuit anharmonicity and the states' charge dispersion, is essential for designing performant qubits. This control is usually achieved by adjusting the circuit's geometry. In-situ control is traditionally obtained via an external magnetic field, in the case of tunnel Josephson junctions. More recently, semiconductor-weak-links-based Josephson junctions have emerged as an alternative building block with the advantage of tunability via the electric-field effect. Gate-tunable Josephson junctions have been succesfully integrated in superconducting circuits using for instance semiconducting nanowires or two-dimensional electron gases. In this work we demonstrate, in a graphene superconducting circuit, a large gate-tunability of qubit properties: frequency, anharmonicity and charge dispersion. We rationalize these features using a model considering the transmission of Cooper pairs through Andreev bound states. Noticeably, we show that the high transmission of Cooper pairs in such weak link strongly suppresses the charge dispersion. Our work illustrates the potential for graphene-based qubits as versatile building-blocks in advanced quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Field-controlled Electronic Breathing Modes and Transport in Nanoporous Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous graphene (NPG) has been fabricated by on-surface-self assembly in the form of arrays of apporx. 1 nm-wide graphene nanoribbons connected via molecular bridges in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. It is predicted that NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we demonstrate how the electronic wave guidance may be controlled by the use of electrical fields transverse to the ribbons; at low fields, point injected currents display spatially periodic patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of the self-repeating patterns under disorder demonstrate that the breathing modes of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Hole spin qubits in unstrained Germanium layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strained germanium heterostructures are one of the most promising material for hole spin qubits but suffer from the strong anisotropy of the gyromagnetic factors that hinders the optimization of the magnetic field orientation. The figures of merit (Rabi frequencies, lifetimes...) can indeed vary by an order of magnitude within a few degrees around the heterostructure plane. We propose to address this issue by confining the holes at the interface of an unstrained, bulk Ge substrate or thick buffer. We model such structures and show that the gyromagnetic anisotropy is indeed considerably reduced. In addition, the Rabi frequencies and quality factors can be significantly improved with respect to strained heterostructures. This extends the operational range of the qubits and shall ease the scale-up to many-qubit systems.</description>

Abstract: I study electron transport through a Y-shaped junction of helical edge states in a two-dimensional topological insulator (2DTI), focusing on the strongly interacting regime. An experimentally accessible device geometry is proposed, and the corresponding conductance tensor is calculated.

      <title>Estimation of Exciton Binding Energy and lifetime for Mono-layer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical model for the Wannier-Mott exciton in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides such as $WS_2$, $WSe_2$, $MoS_2$, $MoSe_2$ that estimates the radiation lifetime in the effective mass approximation. We calculate exciton energy, and binding energy by solving the Schrodinger wave equation with open boundary conditions to obtain quasi-bound states in the confined direction in the monolayer and decay rates by the Fermi-Golden rule. The proposed model uses only the physical parameters such as band offsets, effective mass, and dielectric constants for the monolayers of $WS_2$, $WSe_2$, $MoS_2$, and $MoSe_2$. The model is validated against III-V material quantum well heterostructure, and the estimated effective lifetime considering the thermalization of the exciton has been compared with photoluminescence decay for the TMD heterostructure. Our calculated values show good agreement with the time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements and DFT estimations.</description>

      <title>Delicate Wannier insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The defining feature of topological insulators is that their valence states are not continuously deformable to a suitably defined atomic limit without breaking the symmetry or closing the energy gap. When the atomic limit is given by symmetric exponentially-localized Wannier orbitals, one finds stable and fragile topological insulators characterized by robust bulk-boundary correspondence. More recently, delicate topological insulators (DIs) have been introduced, whose metallic states are guaranteed only at sharply terminated edges and surfaces. Although Wannierizable, their Wannier orbitals necessarily span multiple unit cells, thus refining the notion of the atomic limit. In this work, we extend delicate topological invariants from Bloch states to hybrid Wannier functions. The resulting models, dubbed delicate Wannier insulators (DWIs), are deformable to unicellular atomic limit in the absence of edges and surfaces; nevertheless, they exhibit obstructions to such deformations as well as topological boundary states in the presence of sharply terminated hinges and corners. We present a layering construction that allows us to elevate a DI in $d$ dimensions into a DWI in $(d\,{+}\,1)$ dimensions. We illustrate the phenomenology of DWIs by deploying the layering construction on three concrete models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a semiclassical theory for electrons in a non-Hermitian periodic system subject to perturbations varying slowly in space and time. We derive the energy of the wavepacket to first order in the gradients of the perturbations. Applying the theory to the specific case of a uniform external magnetic field, we obtain an expression for the orbital magnetization energy. Using the principles of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful non-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it is compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary part of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate from an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a non-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>Superconducting antiqubits achieve optimal phase estimation via unitary inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A positron is equivalent to an electron traveling backward through time. Casting transmon superconducting qubits as akin to electrons, we simulate a positron with a transmon subject to particular resonant and off-resonant drives. We call positron-like transmons "antiqubits." An antiqubit's effective gyromagnetic ratio equals the negative of a qubit's. This fact enables us to time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement, to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field. We prove this result theoretically and observe it experimentally. This work shows how antimatter, whether real or simulated, can enable platform-specific unitary inversion and benefit quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Demonstration of non-Abelian statistics of zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) is crucial for long-sought-after decoherence-free topological quantum computing. The ability to move the MBS on a two-dimensional platform such as a planar Josephson junction is practically constrained by a fixed direction of applied magnetic field. In addition, the detrimental effects of the magnetic field on proximity-induced superconductivity in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures is an outstanding problem for the realization of topological superconductivity. Here we show that these problems can be solved in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which generates the MBS without the need of any external magnetic field, phase biasing, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using a high-temperature superconductor having $d$-wave pairing symmetry, we confirm that our planar junction can support the MBS at high temperatures. We propose protocols for performing non-trivial fusion, exchange and non-Abelian braiding of multiple MBS in our field-free platforms. The proposed geometries and MBS movement protocols open a path towards successful experimental detection of the MBS via confirmation of their non-Abelian statistics.</description>

      <title>Substrate pre-sputtering for layer-by-layer van der Waals epitaxy of 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenides, with their atomically layered structure, favourable electronic and mechanical properties, and often strong spin-orbit coupling, are ideal systems for fundamental studies and for applications ranging from spintronics to optoelectronics. Their bottom-up synthesis via epitaxial techniques such as molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) has, however, proved challenging. Here, we develop a simple substrate pre-treatment process utilising exposure to a low-energy noble gas plasma. We show how this dramatically enhances nucleation of an MBE-grown epilayer atop, and through this, realise a true layer-by-layer growth mode. We further demonstrate the possibility of tuning the resulting growth dynamics via control of the species and dose of the plasma exposure.</description>

      <title>Rigorous theory of coupled resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the general failure of the famous concept of tight binding and mode hybridization underlying modern theories of coupled open resonators. In spite of sophisticated examples in the literature, successfully illustrating these theories, the latter fail to describe any planar systems. This includes the simplest possible case of two dielectric slabs placed next to each other or separated by a distance, which is straightforward for verification, due to its analytical solvability. We present a rigorous theory capable of calculating correctly the eigenmodes of arbitrary three-dimensional dispersive coupled resonators in terms of their individual modes, providing insight into the proper mode hybridization and formation of bonding and antibonding supermodes. Planar optical resonators, such as coupled slabs and Bragg-mirror microcavities, are used for illustrative purposes as they allow precise and reliable verification of the theory.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Gradient Training: A novel training paradigm for bridging the gap between deep neural networks and physical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with normal state field trainability in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and chirality in the superconducting state and its relation to the symmetry and topology in the normal state are important issues in modern condensed matter physics. Here, we report the observation of nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents (Ic) at zero applied magnetic field: Ic exhibits different values in opposite directions, in both flakes and micro-bridges of the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. Such spontaneous nonreciprocity requires TRS and inversion symmetry breakings. We find that the direction of asymmetry changes randomly in repeated sample heating to 300 K and cooling into the zero-resistance state, consistent with the expected behavior arising from spontaneous TRS breaking. Crucially, on applying a perpendicular magnetic field at 300 K, above the charge density wave (CDW) transition at TCDW in this compound and removing it to zero well above the superconducting onset critical temperature (Tc), the direction of the Ic asymmetry consistently flips on changing the direction of the field. This magnetic field training ascertains that the CDW state above the superconducting transition temperature may also break the Z2 TRS and has a macroscopic directionality which can be changed by a uniform training field. The symmetry breaking continues into the superconducting state and gives rise to the nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents. These results indicate the loop-current CDW normal state with topological features in CsV3Sb5. Our observations provide direct evidence for the TRS breaking in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, and offer new insights into the mechanism of TRS breaking in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Stub Length Influence on Dispersion Relations and Parity Effect in Aharonov-Bohm Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm (AB) rings with side-attached stubs are model systems for quantum-interference studies in mesoscopic physics. The geometry of such systems, particularly the ratio of stub length ($v$) to ring circumference ($u$), can significantly alter their electronic states. In this work, we solve Deo's transcendental mode-condition equation (Eq. 2.15 from Deo, 2021 [Deo2021]) numerically -- using Python's NumPy and SciPy libraries -- for ring-stub geometries with $v/u = 0.200, 0.205,$ and $0.210$ to generate dispersion relations ($ku$ vs. $\Phi/\Phi_{0}$) and the underlying function $\text{Re}(1/T)$. We find that changing $v/u$ shifts several of the six lowest calculated dispersion branches, with $\Delta(ku)$ up to approximately $0.34$ for the 6th branch at $\Phi=0$ when comparing $v/u=0.200$ and $v/u=0.210$. This also alters gap widths. Notably, for $v/u=0.205$ and $v/u=0.210$, the 5th and 6th consecutive calculated modes both exhibit paramagnetic slopes near zero Aharonov-Bohm flux, indicating the parity breakdown initiates at or below $v/u=0.205$. This directly demonstrates a breakdown of the simple alternating parity effect predicted by Deo (2021) [Deo2021]. These results highlight the sensitivity of mesoscopic ring spectra to fine-tuning of stub length, with potential implications for experimental control of persistent currents, as further illustrated by calculations of the net current.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generated trinitreno-s-heptazine, a small molecule featuring three nitrene centers, by tip-induced chemistry from the precursor 2,5,8-triazido-s-heptazine on bilayer NaCl on Au(111). The precursor's azide groups were dissociated to form mono-, di- and trinitreno-s-heptazine, yielding molecules with one to three nitrene centers. The precursor and its products are characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy. Broken-symmetry DFT and configuration interaction calculations of inter- and intra-nitrene exchange couplings suggest a ferromagnetic coupling of the S = 1 nitrene centers, resulting in a high-spin septet ground state for neutral trinitreno-s-heptazine in the gas phase. On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), the combined results of experiments and theory suggest trinitreno-s-heptazine to be an anion with a sextet ground state.</description>

      <title>Impact of border defects on the magnetic flux penetration in superconducting films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in superconducting systems are ubiquitous and nearly unavoidable. They can vary in nature, geometry, and size, ranging from microscopic-size defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, twin planes, and oxygen vacancies, to macroscopic-size defects such as segregations, indentations, contamination, cracks, or voids. Irrespective of their type, defects perturb the otherwise laminar flow of electric current, forcing it to deviate from its path. In the best-case scenario, the associated perturbation can be damped within a distance of the order of the size of the defect if the rigidity of the superconducting state, characterized by the creep exponent $n$, is low. In most cases, however, this perturbation spans macroscopic distances covering the entire superconducting sample and thus dramatically influences the response of the system. In this work, we review the current state of theoretical understanding and experimental evidence on the modification of magnetic flux patterns in superconductors by border defects, including the influence of their geometry, temperature, and applied magnetic field. We scrutinize and contrast the picture emerging from a continuous media standpoint, i.e. ignoring the granularity imposed by the vortex quantization, with that provided by a phenomenological approach dictated by the vortex dynamics. In addition, we discuss the influence of border indentations on the nucleation of thermomagnetic instabilities. Assessing the impact of surface and border defects is of utmost importance for all superconducting technologies, including superconducting resonators, superconducting single-photon detectors, superconducting radio-frequency cavities and accelerators, superconducting cables, superconducting metamaterials, superconducting diodes, and many others.</description>

      <title>Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>

Abstract: The topological quantum phases in antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ hold promise for next-generation spintronics, but their experimental realization has been constrained by challenges in preparing high-quality devices. In this work, we report a new wax-assisted exfoliation and transfer method that enables the fabrication of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ heterostructures with both surfaces encapsulated by AlO$_x$. This strategy strongly enhances the topological quantum phases in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ flakes. We observe the robust axion insulator state in even-layer device with wide zero Hall plateau and high longitudinal resistivity, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect in odd-layer device with large hysteresis and sharp plateau transition. These results demonstrate that the combination of wax exfoliation and AlO$_x$ encapsulation provides great potentials for exploring novel topological quantum phenomena and potential applications in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and other two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bilayer triple-Q state driven by interlayer higher-order exchange interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations and an atomistic spin model we predict the stabilization of a bilayer triple-Q state in an atomic Mn bilayer on Ir(111) due to interlayer higher-order exchange interactions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) we study the magnetic interactions and ground state in a Mn monolayer and bilayer on the Ir(111) surface. We calculate the energy dispersion of spin spirals (single-Q states) to scan a large part of the magnetic phase space and to obtain constants of pair-wise exchange interactions. By including spin-orbit coupling we determine the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. To reveal the role of higher-order exchange interactions in these films, we consider multi-Q states obtained by a superposition of spin spirals. For the Mn monolayer in fcc stacking on Ir(111), the triple-Q state exhibits the lowest total energy in DFT, while the N\'eel state is most favorable for hcp stacking. For the Mn bilayer on Ir(111), two types of the triple-Q state are possible. In both magnetic configurations, a triple-Q state occurs within each of the Mn layers. However, only in one of them the spin alignment between the layers is such that nearest-neighbor spins of different layers also exhibit the tetrahedron angles which characterize the triple-Q state. We denote this state -- which has the lowest total energy in our DFT calculations -- as the ideal bilayer triple-Q state. This state exhibits significant topological orbital moments within each of the two Mn layers which are aligned in parallel resulting in a large topological orbital magnetization. We interpret the DFT results within an atomistic spin model which includes pair-wise Heisenberg exchange, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as well as higher-order exchange interactions....</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Metallicity in {\AA}ngstr\"om-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the {\aa}ngstr\"om-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repeated quantum non-demolition measurement is a cornerstone of quantum error correction protocols. In superconducting qubits, the speed of dispersive state readout can be enhanced by increasing the power of the readout tone. However, such an increase has been found to result in additional qubit state transitions that violate the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Recently, the readout of a transmon superconducting qubit was improved by using a tone with frequency much larger than the qubit frequency. Here, we experimentally identify the mechanisms of readout-induced transitions in this regime. In the dominant mechanism, the energy of an incoming readout photon is partially absorbed by the transmon and partially returned to the transmission line as a photon with lower frequency. Other mechanisms involve the excitation of unwanted package modes, decay via material defects, and, at higher qubit frequencies, the activation of undesired resonances in the transmon spectrum. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of superconducting qubit state transitions caused by a strong drive.</description>

      <title>Capacitance-based Fermion parity read-out and predicted Rabi oscillations in a Majorana nanowire</title>

Abstract: Recent experiments have measured flux dependent capacitance at radio frequencies leading to the potential for a fast parity read-out of a Majorana qubit. In this work we argue that the quantum dot used in the capacitance measurement can be reasonably approximated by a non-interacting weakly coupled orbital. We then predict the measured flux and parity dependent capacitance for several parameter regimes of the disordered Majorana nanowire model that are both topological and trivial. Following this we study how such a fast capacitance read-out can be used to characterize the quantum coherence of a Majorana nanowire-based qubit using Rabi oscillations. We additionally show that such measurements, if made possible by coherent inter-wire tunneling, would provide a valuable way of characterizing the low energy states in the frequency domain.</description>

Abstract: The quantum conductance of circuits built on flat (Euclidean) two-dimensional electron gases in known to show a symmetric response to the inversion of Rashba spin-orbit coupling fields in Aharonov-Casher interference patterns. Here, we show that this symmetry breaks down in curved (non-Euclidean) circuits defined on a spherical two-dimensional electron gas. We demonstrate that this is a consequence of parallel spin transport and holonomy on the surface of the sphere, and that a symmetric response can be recovered when considering the parallel transport condition as an offset. We discuss triangular circuits defined along geodesic arcs on the sphere as a case study, and generalize it to regular polygons and parallel curves of given latitude.</description>

      <title>Exceptional magic angles in non-Hermitian twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) features strongly correlated and topological phases due to its flat bands emerging near the magic angle. However, the effects of the non-Hermiticity, arising from the coupling to the environment and dissipation, have remained unexplored. We here develop a simple non-Hermitian (NH) version of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by considering relative twisting of two NH graphene monolayers with non-Hermiticity encoded in the imbalance of in-plane nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes. Remarkably, by generalizing the Bistritzer-MacDonald approach to NH systems, we discover exceptional magic angles where the band structure changes from purely real to purely imaginary thus featuring flat bands with infinite lifetime. Between them, the bands remain flattened, and a Hermitian magic angle emerges at which the imaginary part of energy is maximal, and corresponds to the usual magic angle in non-dissipative, purely Hermitian TBG. We propose an optical lattice setup with gain and loss where our theoretical predictions can be verified. These results suggest the robustness of the flat bands in open systems, paving the way for the further studies on the interplay of dissipative effects, electronic topology, and interactions in such NH moir\'e bands.</description>

      <title>Modeling of the micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although micro-focused Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has been used for more than twenty years, it lacks a complete theoretical description. This complicates the analysis of experimental data and significantly limits the information that can be obtained. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a semi-analytical model based on the mesoscopic continuous medium approach. The model consists of the following steps: calculation of the incident electric field and the dynamic susceptibility, calculation of the induced polarisation, and calculation of the emitted electric field and its propagation towards the detector. We demonstrate the model on the examples of the measurements of thermal and coherently excited spin waves. However, the used approach is general and can describe any micro-focused Brillouin light scattering experiment. The model can also bring new analytical approaches to mechanobiology experiments or to characterization of acoustic wave based devices.</description>

      <title>Wave-packet dynamics in a graphene with periodic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Dirac continuum model to study the propagation of electronic wave packets in graphene with periodically arranged circular potential steps. The time propagation of the wave packets are calculated using the split-operator method for different size, height and separation of the barriers. The time propagation of the wave packets is calculated using the split-operator method for various barrier sizes, heights, and separations. We found that, despite the pronounced Klein tunneling effect in graphene, the presence of a lattice of defects significantly impacts the propagation properties of the wave packets. For example, depending on the height and size of the incident wave packet, the transmission probability can decrease by more than 20\%. The alteration of the polarity of the potential barriers also contributes to the transmission probabilities of the wave packet in graphene. The obtained results could provide valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of charge carrier dynamics in graphene-based nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Three-body Fermi liquid corrections for an infinite-$U$ SU($N$) Anderson impurity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the three-body Fermi liquid effects in the SU($N$) Anderson impurity model in the strong interaction limit where the occupation number $N_d^{}$ of the impurity levels varies over the range of $0&lt;N_d^{}&lt;1$. The three-body correlation of impurity electrons contributes to the next-to-leading order terms of transport coefficients at low energies when the electron-hole symmetry, the time-reversal symmetries, or both are broken by external fields or potentials. Using the numerical renormalization group approach, we calculate the differential conductance and the nonlinear current noise through quantum dots, as well as the thermal conductivity of both quantum dots and magnetic alloys. Specifically, we focus on the SU(2) and SU(4) cases and demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve in the limit of $U\to\infty$, across the $1/N$-filling Kondo regime and the valence fluctuation regime. Our results clarify how the three-body correlation affects low-energy transport, with a crucial dependence on the occupation number $N_d^{}$. We also show that the three-body correlation strongly couples with asymmetries in the tunnel couplings between quantum dots and reservoirs; in particular it significantly affects the nonlinear current through the quarter-filling Kondo state for $N=4$.</description>

      <title>Propagation of ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherent transport of time-resolved ultrafast excitations in nanoelectronic interferometers is expected to exhibit an interesting interplay between the interferences and the time-dependent drive. However, the typical frequencies required to unlock this physics are in the THz range, making its observation challenging. In this work, we consider the propagation of the excitation generated by ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot, a system which we argue can display similar physics at significantly lower frequencies. We model the system with a single resonant level connected to two infinite electrodes subjected to a time-dependent voltage bias. For short pulses, we predict that the behaviour of the dot contrasts sharply with the long pulse (adiabatic) limit: the current actually oscillates with the amplitude of the voltage pulse. In the ultrafast limit, we predict that the current can even be negative, i.e. flow against the voltage drop. Our results are obtained by a combination of two approaches that are in quantitative agreement: explicit analytical expressions in the ultrafast and ultraslow limits and exact numerical simulations. We discuss the applicability of our findings and conclude that this system should be within reach of existing experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Exchange-phase erasure in anyonic Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-particle interferometry is an important tool for extracting the exchange statistics of quantum particles. We theoretically investigate the prospects of such interferometry to probe the statistics of point-like anyonic excitations injected in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) setup based on a quantum point contact device in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We compute the standard HOM ratio, i.e., the ratio of tunneling noises for two- and one-particle injections, and find that for point-like anyons, it only depends on the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension. Importantly, the latter is not necessarily related to the exchange phase. In fact, we establish that the HOM ratio does not reveal the exchange phase of the injected anyons: For injection-time delays that are small compared to the thermal time scale, we find that the exchange phase accumulated due to time-domain braiding between injected and thermally activated anyons is erased due to two mutually canceling sub-processes. In contrast, for time delays large compared to the thermal time, only a single sub-process contributes to the braiding, but the accumulated phase is canceled in the HOM ratio. These findings suggest caution when interpreting HOM interferometry experiments with anyons and approaches beyond the standard HOM ratio are thus necessary to extract anyonic statistics with two-particle interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our $\mathbb{Z}$ Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we report a prominent quantum oscillation in the conductance of 2H-MoTe2 based resonant tunneling structure. In this work, a n-WSe2/HfO2/i-MoTe2/HfO2/Au resonant tunneling device (RTD) with a symmetric and asymmetric double barrier has been fabricated using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown 2H-MoTe2 and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) grown 2H-WSe2 along with theoretical modeling by adopting non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) formalism. The impact of MoTe2-quantum well widths equal, and above its excitonic Bohr radius (EBR:0.7 nm) on resonant tunneling current is investigated at cryogenic temperatures. Such peak values increase with downscaling of the well width up to a certain value and then it decreases with further miniaturization. The corresponding maximum peak-to-valley current ratio (PVR) is estimated to be 4 at 4K in the low voltage range for the very first time in MoTe2 based RTD. Therefore, the present work may provide the route for fabrication of WSe2/MoTe2-based high performance resonant tunneling devices integrable with HEMT device for modern Qubit architecture operational at ultra-low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Broken Symmetry in Ideal Chern Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the fractional anomalous quantum Hall effect in moir\'e materials have reignited the interest in fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). The chiral limit in which analytic Landau level-like single-particle states form an ``ideal" Chern band and local interactions lead to Laughlin-like FCIs at $1/3$ filling, has been very useful for understanding these systems by relating them to the lowest Landau level. We show, however, that, even in the idealized chiral limit, a fluctuating quantum geometry is associated with strongly broken symmetries and a phenomenology very different from that of Landau levels. In particular, particle-hole symmetry is strongly violated and e.g. at $2/3$ filling an emergent interaction driven Fermi liquid state with no Landau level counterpart is energetically favoured. In fact, even the exact Laughlin-like zero modes at $1/3$ filling have a non-uniform density tracking the underlying quantum geometry. Switching to a Coulomb interaction, the ideal Chern band with electron filling of $1/4$ features trivial charge density wave states. Moreover, applying a particle-hole transformation reveals that the ideal Chern band with hole filling of $3/4$ supports a quantum anomalous Hall crystal with quantized Hall conductance of $e^2/h$. These phenomena have no direct lowest Landau level counterpart.</description>

Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the average amplitude of the optical field in optomechanical systems are obtained, in which, in addition to the linear interaction, quadratic and cubic interactions of the vibrational mode of the mechanical resonator with the mode of the optical resonator are considered. In the framework of the non-secular perturbation theory, using the Bogoliubov averaging method, it is shown that the effects of photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations in such systems can be realized. The main contribution to the formation of revivals is provided by the Kerr self-action of the optical mode and the cross-Kerr interaction of the fourth degree in optical and mechanical amplitudes. The cross-Kerr interactions of the sixth- and eighth-order in amplitudes destroy the regular structure of revivals. The influence of these cross-Kerr nonlinearities disappears with an increase in the decay rate of the optical mode and is also completely suppressed at zero temperature. It is shown that the asymmetry of the spectral line of the optical field intensity in the cavity is most pronounced with an increase in the degree of nonlinearity and is explained by Fano interference.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge-neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ (bosonic) \updated{ and $1/3$ (fermionic) fractional Chern insulator (FCI)} on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor acquires a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. As the system approaches the FCI-to-CDW transition point, we observe a pronounced sharpening of the roton mode, suggesting that the magnetoroton behaves more like a quasiparticle as it softens. Notably, this occurs while the single-particle gap remains finite. Besides the magnetoroton at finite momentum, we also construct quadrupolar chiral operators in a discrete lattice and resolve the chiral graviton mode around the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we show the different chiralities of the gravitons of FCIs with opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time.</description>

      <title>Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>

Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Imprinting of skyrmions and bimerons in an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic states in condensed matter physics, particularly antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions (Sks) and bimerons (Bms), offer promising prospects for terahertz dynamics and sustained current-induced motion, thanks to their compensating multiple sub-lattice structure. However, nucleating AFM Sks and Bms is challenging due to the lack of net magnetization. Previous attempts to imprint pre-defined Sks and Bms in a ferromagnet (FM) and transfer them to an AFM using interfacial exchange bias in FM/AFM heterostructures have been hindered by complex multilayers with discontinuities, polycrystallinity, or multipartite chiral AFMs. Employing atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate the viability of texture imprinting for nucleating Sks and Bms in AFMs, using a prototypical bipartite AFM layer in a multilayer structure free from discontinuities. Such imprinting is a crucial step towards understanding the static and dynamic properties of natural antiferromagnetic textures and their unique properties.</description>

      <title>Ordering the topological order in the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possible topological order/topological quantum field theory of different quantum Hall systems. Given the value of the Hall conductivity, we constrain the global symmetry of the low-energy theory and its anomaly. Specifically, the one-form global symmetry and its anomaly are presented as the organizing principle of these systems. This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</description>

      <title>Phase engineering of MoS$_2$ monolayers: A pathway to enhanced lithium-polysulfide battery performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li--S) batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li--S interactions, greater charge transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart, effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li--S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.</description>

      <title>Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic materials combine compensated magnetic order with momentum-dependent spin splitting, offering a fundamentally new route for spintronic functionality beyond conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. While most studies have focused on three-dimensional compounds, the emergence of altermagnetism in few-layer two-dimensional materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that bilayer MnPS$_3$, a prototypical 2D van der Waals magnet, can host stacking-induced altermagnetic phases. Using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis, we show that interlayer spin alignment and lateral displacement act as coupled symmetry control parameters that switch the system between Type II (collinear AFM) and Type III (altermagnetic) phases. Our systematic exploration reveals how specific stacking geometries enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. These results establish stacking engineering as a powerful, purely structural route for designing tunable altermagnetic states in 2D magnets, opening pathways toward symmetry-driven spintronic and magnetoelectronic devices.</description>
