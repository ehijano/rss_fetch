      <title>A Unified Intracellular pH Landscape with SITE-pHorin: a Quantum-Entanglement-Enhanced pH Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate map of intracellular organelle pH is crucial for comprehending cellular metabolism and organellar functions. However, a unified intracellular pH spectrum using a single probe is still lack. Here, we developed a novel quantum entanglement-enhanced pH-sensitive probe called SITE-pHorin, which featured a wide pH-sensitive range and ratiometric quantitative measurement capabilities. Subsequently, we measured the pH of various organelles and their sub-compartments, including mitochondrial sub-spaces, Golgi stacks, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and endosomes in COS-7 cells. For the long-standing debate on mitochondrial compartments pH, we measured the pH of mitochondrial cristae as 6.60 \pm 0.40, the pH of mitochondrial intermembrane space as 6.95 \pm 0.30, and two populations of mitochondrial matrix pH at approximately 7.20 \pm 0.27 and 7.50 \pm 0.16, respectively. Notably, the lysosome pH exhibited a single, narrow Gaussian distribution centered at 4.79 \pm 0.17. Furthermore, quantum chemistry computations revealed that both the deprotonation of the residue Y182 and the discrete curvature of deformed benzene ring in chromophore are both necessary for the quantum entanglement mechanism of SITE-pHorin. Intriguingly, our findings reveal an accurate pH gradient (0.6-0.9 pH unit) between mitochondrial cristae and matrix, suggesting prior knowledge about \Delta pH (0.4-0.6) and mitochondrial proton motive force (pmf) are underestimated.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking structure-based three-dimensional molecular generative models using GenBench3D: ligand conformation quality matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) deep molecular generative models offer the advantage of goal-directed generation based on 3D-dependent properties, such as binding affinity for structure-based design within binding pockets. Traditional benchmarks created to evaluate SMILES or molecular graphs generators, such as GuacaMol or MOSES, are limited to evaluate 3D generators as they do not assess the quality of the generated molecular conformation. In this work, we hence developed GenBench3D, which implements a new benchmark for models producing molecules within a binding pocket. Our main contribution is the Validity3D metric, evaluating the conformation quality using the likelihood of bond lengths and valence angles based on reference values observed in the Cambridge Structural Database. The LiGAN, 3D-SBDD, Pocket2Mol, TargetDiff, DiffSBDD and ResGen models were benchmarked. We show that only between 0% and 11% of generated molecules have valid conformations. Performing local relaxation of generated molecules in the pocket considerably improved the Validity3D for all models by a minimum increase of 40%. For LiGAN, 3D-SBDD, or TargetDiff, the set of valid relaxed molecules shows on average higher Vina score (i.e. worse) than the set of raw generated molecules, indicating that the binding affinity of raw generated molecules might be overestimated. Using the other scoring functions, that give higher importance to ligand strain, only yield improved scores when using valid relaxed molecules. Using valid relaxed molecules, TargetDiff and Pocket2Mol show better median Vina, Glide and Gold PLP scores than other models. We have publicly released GenBench3D on GitHub for broader use: https://github.com/bbaillif/genbench3d</description>

      <title>LinearAlifold: Linear-Time Consensus Structure Prediction for RNA Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the consensus structure of a set of aligned RNA homologs is a convenient method to find conserved structures in an RNA genome, which has many applications including viral diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the most commonly used tool for this task, RNAalifold, is prohibitively slow for long sequences, due to a cubic scaling with the sequence length, taking over a day on 400 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related genomes (~30,000nt). We present LinearAlifold, a much faster alternative that scales linearly with both the sequence length and the number of sequences, based on our work LinearFold that folds a single RNA in linear time. Our work is orders of magnitude faster than RNAalifold (0.7 hours on the above 400 genomes, or ~36$\times$ speedup) and achieves higher accuracies when compared to a database of known structures. More interestingly, LinearAlifold's prediction on SARS-CoV-2 correlates well with experimentally determined structures, substantially outperforming RNAalifold. Finally, LinearAlifold supports two energy models (Vienna and BL*) and four modes: minimum free energy (MFE), maximum expected accuracy (MEA), ThreshKnot, and stochastic sampling, each of which takes under an hour for hundreds of SARS-CoV variants. Our resource is at: https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearAlifold (code) and http://linearfold.org/linear-alifold (server).</description>

      <title>L+M-24: Building a Dataset for Language + Molecules @ ACL 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language-molecule models have emerged as an exciting direction for molecular discovery and understanding. However, training these models is challenging due to the scarcity of molecule-language pair datasets. At this point, datasets have been released which are 1) small and scraped from existing databases, 2) large but noisy and constructed by performing entity linking on the scientific literature, and 3) built by converting property prediction datasets to natural language using templates. In this document, we detail the $\textit{L+M-24}$ dataset, which has been created for the Language + Molecules Workshop shared task at ACL 2024. In particular, $\textit{L+M-24}$ is designed to focus on three key benefits of natural language in molecule design: compositionality, functionality, and abstraction.</description>
