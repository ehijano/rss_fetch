      <title>Quantum correlation dynamics and in-medium 3$\leftrightarrow$3 collisions of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we aim for quantifying the role of in-medium 3$\leftrightarrow$3 collisions for systems of fermions which initially are out-off equilibrium. The formulation of the 3-body dynamics is based on the equations of motion method for identical fermions -- also denoted as quantum correlation dynamics -- and presented in detail. The on-shell 2-body collision integral is briefly reviewed and the on-shell 3-body collision integral is derived on the basis of the same two-body interaction in leading order. The resulting equations obey particle number as well as energy-momentum conservation. For a quantification of the relative impact of 3-body interactions we employ a model study for a homogeneous system in space in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions. We address spin-isospin symmetric nuclear matter systems with momentum distributions that are given by shifted Fermi spheres (without overlap) as encountered in the initial phase of nucleus-nucleus collisions after contact. The results for the relaxation times -- employing an effective 2-body interaction -- are compared to Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) transport calculations in the continuum limit for the same bombarding energies and are found to agree on the level of a few percent. We find that the additional 3-body interactions reduce the relaxation times up to a factor of 3 at 130 A$\cdot$MeV. Furthermore, it is shown in BUU transport calculations that an enhanced stopping by 3$\leftrightarrow$3 collisions shows up in the angular distribution of energetic nucleons ($&gt;$ 60 MeV) e.g. in central $^{97}_{45}Rh$ collisions at 40 A$\cdot$MeV that lead to the formation of a compound nucleus. The angular distribution of the energetic nucleons changes from a slightly forward peaked angular distribution to a slightly sidewards peaked angular distribution which might be controlled experimentally.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the strength of first-order phase transition in the low density region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically studied the first-order phase transitions in the low-density region of neutron star matter using a unified framework combining the parity doublet model for hadronic matter, an NJL-type quark model for high-density quark matter, and a model-independent intermediate region treatment. By confronting with recent neutron star observation constraints, we find it possible to have the early phase transitions (PT) at low densities ($n_B \leq 2n_0$) in a way consistent with existing neutron star observations. We also establish the upper limits of the PT strength for each chiral invariant mass in parity doublet model. We find that larger chiral invariant mass lead to smaller allowed phase transition strengths, providing new insights and clue into nucleon mass origin. This connection between the microscopic structure of nucleons and macroscopic neutron star properties shows how astrophysical observations can constrain fundamental QCD mechanisms underlying hadron mass generation.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the $ppp$ correlation function within the hyperspherical adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of the three-particle correlation function involving three hadrons started just recently after the first publications of ALICE measurements. Key elements to be considered are the correct description of the asymptotics, antisymmetrization issues and, in most cases, the treatment of the Coulomb interaction. In the case of the $ppp$ correlation function, a first analysis was done where the hyperspherical adiabatic method was used to determine the $ppp$ wave function at different energies. Although the asymptotic behavior, antisymmetrization issues and the treatment of the Coulomb interaction were discussed in detail, the convergence properties of the adiabatic basis were studied at low energies around the formation of the correlation peak determined mainly by the $J^\pi=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ three-body states. Since many and very precise data have been taken or are planned to be measured at energies beyond the peak, we present an analysis of the convergence characteristics of the basis as the energy of the process increases. We show that in order to describe correctly the correlation tail it is necessary to consider three-body states up to $J^\pi=21/2^-$ whereas higher states can be considered as free. Once those states are incorporated solving the associate dynamical equations, the agreement with the experimental data is found to be excellent.</description>

      <title>Neutron Magic Numbers in $sd$ Shell from Nuclear Charge Radii within Neutron-Proton Correction around the Fermi Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge radii are sensitive indicators to identify the nuclear structure phenomena throughout the whole nuclide chart. In particular, the shrunken trend of changes of charge radii along a long isotopic chain is intimately associated with the shell quenching effect. In this work, the systematic evolution of charge radii along the proton numbers $Z=8$, $10$, $12$, $14$, $18$ isotopes is investigated by a relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov model. A ansatz about neutron-proton correlation around Fermi surface is considered for describing the abnormal behavior of nuclear charge radii. Our results show that the neutron-proton pairing corrections around the Fermi surface lead to a sudden strengthening of the charge radii of these isotopic chains at $N=8$, 20 and 28, reflecting the fact that this correction enhances the shell closure across $N=8$, 20 and 28. The reproduction of the $N=14$ charge radius in the Mg isotopes is affected by the way in which pairing correlations are handled, with BCS theory overestimating the shell effect of $N=14$, and the Bogoliubov quasiparticle transformation suggests a stronger pairing correlation near the proton Fermi surface, which is more consistent with experimental results. An analysis of the deviations from the theoretical and available experimental data for the charge radii of the 24 selected even-even nuclei shows that the neutron-proton pairing correction around the Fermi surface has an improved effect on the calculation of the charge {radii} using the meson-exchange effective interactions, but it does not help to significantly improve the results calculated by the density-dependent effective interactions.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Constraining the EoS of Neutron Stars Using Post-Merger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\sim$1 km ( $\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of holographic baryon in strongly coupled fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin polarization for baryon in a hydrodynamic medium has been extensively studied in the weakly coupled regime using quantum kinetic theory. As a first study of this problem in the strongly coupled regime, we investigate holographically the spectral function of a probe baryon in the fluid-gravity background. This is done by carefully performing gradient expansion of the Dirac equation in the fluid-gravity background. Different contributions in the expansion are understood in terms of density matrices of the probe baryon and the medium. The resulting spectral functions indicate that the holographic baryonic is polarized as responses to fluid acceleration, shear stress and vorticity. The structures of the responses are similar to those found in weakly coupled studies.</description>

      <title>Probing nuclear structure in relativistic p-O and O-O collisions at the LHC through the measurement of anisotropic flow coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RHIC and LHC plan to inject $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei with a focus to investigate collectivity and the origin of quark-gluon plasma signatures in small collision systems. $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei is known to possess clusters of $\alpha$-particles ($^{4}\rm He$) inside the nucleus. In this paper, we study the anisotropic flow coefficients such as elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), which are sensitive to the nuclear geometry of colliding nuclei, for p-O and O-O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=9.61$ TeV and 7 TeV respectively. The study is performed employing a hybrid model encompassing IPGlasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD. The results of the clustered nuclear geometry are compared with those of the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. Both initial and final state anisotropies are explored. This study is thus one of its first kind, where the study of anisotropic flow coefficients for p-O and O-O collisions is presented using a hybrid hydrodynamics model. We find a small effect of $\alpha$-clustering in p-O, while a significant one for O-O collisions. It is also observed that the magnitude of the effect correlates with the size of the $^{4}$He.</description>

      <title>Renormalizing the Quark-Meson-Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark (QMD) model by comparing a renormalization approach with a renormalization-group (RG) consistent mean-field formulation based on the functional renormalization group (FRG). The renormalized QMD allows analytical investigations of key quantities such as the zero-temperature diquark gap and the critical temperature for color superconductivity, ultimately reproducing the exact BCS relation in the high-density limit. We carry out the same analysis for different schemes of RG-consistent QMD models. We show that the RG-consistent approach yields a phase diagram and thermodynamic properties qualitatively similar to those of the renormalization model, provided both are embedded within a unified scheme that ensures consistent vacuum properties. In particular, both treatments recover the expected high-density features characterized by the BCS relation and the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Our results highlight the relevance of renormalization and RG-consistent methods for accurately capturing the thermodynamics of QMD and related effective models with diquark degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: We have done a systematic no-core shell-model study of $^{20-23}$Na isotopes. The low-energy spectra of these sodium isotopes consisting of natural and un-natural parity states were reported, considering three realistic interactions: inside nonlocal outside Yukawa (INOY), charge-dependent Bonn 2000 (CDB2K), and the chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO). We also present the mirror energy differences in the low-energy spectra of $|T_z|$ = 1/2 mirror pair ($^{21}$Na - $^{21}$Ne). Apart from the energy spectra, we have also reported the electromagnetic transition strengths and moments. Finally, considering all three realistic interactions, we report the point-proton radii and neutron skin thicknesses.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of prompt fission $\gamma$ emission due to the presence of ns to ms isomers in the fragments produced in the neutron-induced fission of $^{233,235}$U and in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf. Calculations performed with the CGMF fission event generator are compared with recent experimental data on $^{252}$Cf(sf) and $^{235}$U($n$,f) obtained with the DANCE+NEUANCE setup at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center. Of particular interest are the average $\gamma$-ray energy spectrum as a function of time since scission, $\phi(\epsilon_\gamma,t)$, the increase of the average $\gamma$-ray multiplicity over time, $N_\gamma(t)$, and its evolution in time as a function of the fission fragment mass, $N_\gamma(A,t)$. The time evolution of isomeric ratios in post-neutron emission fission fragments can be defined and used to test and reveal some deficiencies in our knowledge of the low-lying levels of neutron-rich nuclei produced in fission reactions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic emission from strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dilepton production in heavy-ion, proton-proton, and proton-nucleus collisions from low energies of 1 AGeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies (LHC) using the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. PHSD is a microscopic, non-equilibrium approach that integrates hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom, providing a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions from initial nucleon-nucleon interactions to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation, hadronization, and final-state interactions. Key dilepton sources in PHSD include hadronic decays, bremsstrahlung, QGP radiation ($q+\bar q \to e^+e^-$, \ $q+\bar q \to g+ e^+e^-$, \ $q+g \to q+ e^+e^-$), primary Drell-Yan production, and semileptonic decays of correlated charm and bottom pairs. PHSD well describes dilepton data from HADES, STAR, and ALICE experiments. We examine in-medium effects, such as the vector meson spectral function broadening, and present the excitation function for the dilepton "excess" in the invariant mass range $0.4&lt;M_{ee}&lt;0.75$ GeV/c$^2$. For the first time we report on the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP radiation calculated on a basis of the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) in PHSD. The influence of $\mu_B$ on the QGP yield grows at lower collision energies, where $\mu_B$ becomes large, however, its impact on the total dilepton spectra is small due to the lowering of the QGP volume with decreasing energy. The excitation function of QGP dileptons, is presented versus correlated charm, confirming that the QGP radiation overshines charm contributions at $\sqrt{s} \simeq 25-30$ GeV in central Au+Au collisions, providing access to thermal QGP dileptons at BES RHIC and FAIR.</description>

      <title>Impact of strong magnetic field, baryon chemical potential, and medium anisotropy on polarization and spin alignment of hadrons</title>

Abstract: The recent observation of global spin polarization of $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) hyperons and the spin alignment of $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ vector mesons create remarkable interest in investigating the particle polarization in the relativistic fluid produced in heavy-ion collisions at GeV/TeV energies. Among other sources of spin polarization phenomena, the Debye mass of a medium plays a crucial role in particle polarization. Any modification brought to the effective mass due to the temperature, strong magnetic field ($eB$), baryonic chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$), medium anisotropy ($\xi$), and vorticity, etc., certainly affects the particle spin polarization. In this work, we explore the global hyperon spin polarization and the spin alignment of vector mesons corresponding to the strong magnetic field, baryonic chemical potential, and medium anisotropy. We find that the degree of spin polarization is flavor-dependent for hyperons. Meanwhile, vector meson spin alignment depends on the hadronization mechanisms of initially polarized quarks and anti-quarks. Medium anisotropy significantly changes the degree of spin polarization compared to the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Dark matter admixed neutron stars with a realistic nuclear equation of state from chiral nuclear interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and other stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions at zero temperature and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling.

      <title>Unveiling the jet angular broadening with photon-tagged jets in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The medium modification of jet substructure in hot and dense nuclear matter has garnered significant interest from the heavy-ion physics community in recent years. Measurements of inclusive jets show an angular narrowing in nucleus-nucleus collisions, while recent CMS results for photon-tagged jets ($\gamma$+jets) suggest evidence of broadening. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the angular structure of inclusive jets and $\gamma$+jets using a transport approach that accounts for jet energy loss and the medium response in the quark-gluon plasma. We examine the girth modification of $\gamma$+jets in $0-30\%$ PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, achieving satisfactory agreement with recent CMS measurements. We explore the relationship between selection bias and jet kinematics by varying the threshold for $x_{j\gamma} = p_T^{\rm jet}/p_T^{\gamma}$. Notably, we quantitatively demonstrate that $\gamma$+jets significantly reduce selection bias and can effectively select jets that have been sufficiently quenched in PbPb collisions, which is crucial for capture the jet angular broadening. Additionally, we estimate the contributions of medium-induced gluon radiation and the medium response to the broadening of the jet angular substructure. Lastly, we analyze the modification patterns of jet $R_g$ and $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ in PbPb collisions, which indicate slight broadening for $\gamma$+jets and noticeable narrowing for inclusive jets compared to pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions for bound states in antiprotonic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of bound antiprotons in close proximity to the atomic nucleus. Using experimental data from X-ray spectroscopy measurements of antiprotonic atom transitions, we tune a minimal theoretical framework and estimate parameter ranges where the strong or electromagnetic decay channels govern the stability of the deepest bound states. In this way, we present an overview of the dominant decay mechanism of antiprotonic orbits for a given principle quantum number, to assist future spectroscopic experiments on antiprotonic atoms.</description>

      <title>Isospin asymmetry and neutron stars in V-QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is introduced to V-QCD, a bottom-up holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model. Using a small isospin chemical potential we extract the symmetry energy in the model, finding excellent agreement with experimental results for some of the potentials. Extending the calculation for finite and arbitrary sized isospin chemical potentials, we construct beta-equilibrated neutron stars via the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations. We find, pleasingly, that the neutron stars passing the mass/radius and tidal deformability constraints are those with the potentials that also lead to excellent symmetry energies.</description>
