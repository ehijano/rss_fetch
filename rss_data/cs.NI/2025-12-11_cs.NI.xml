      <title>Tyche: A Hybrid Computation Framework of Illumination Pattern for Satellite Beam Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) use beam hopping to handle non-uniform and time-varying ground traffic demand. A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Eunomia: A Multicontroller Domain Partitioning Framework in Hierarchical Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of mega-satellite constellations, the integration of hierarchical non-terrestrial and terrestrial networks has become a cornerstone of 6G coverage enhancements. In these hierarchical satellite networks, controllers manage satellite switches within their assigned domains. However, the high mobility of LEO satellites and field-of-view (FOV) constraints pose fundamental challenges to efficient domain partitioning. Centralized control approaches face scalability bottlenecks, while distributed architectures with onboard controllers often disregard FOV limitations, leading to excessive signaling overhead. LEO satellites outside a controller's FOV require an average of five additional hops, resulting in a 10.6-fold increase in response time. To address these challenges, we propose Eunomia, a three-step domain-partitioning framework that leverages movement-aware FOV segmentation within a hybrid control plane combining ground stations and MEO satellites. Eunomia reduces control plane latency by constraining domains to FOV-aware regions and ensures single-hop signaling. It further balances traffic load through spectral clustering on a Control Overhead Relationship Graph and optimizes controller assignment via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. We implement Eunomia on the Plotinus emulation platform with realistic constellation parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Eunomia reduces request loss by up to 58.3%, control overhead by up to 50.3\%, and algorithm execution time by 77.7% significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>BlockFLEX: An Adaptive and Survivable Architecture with Hierarchical Routing for LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents \textbf{BlockFLEX}, an adaptive and survivable architecture with a hierarchical routing scheme for Low Earth Orbit satellite networks, designed to address dynamic topology changes and severe link failures.
  By organizing satellites into autonomous blocks, BlockFLEX establishes a survivable underlay network that masks network volatility and offers a stable overlay view. The architecture employs a hierarchical routing scheme integrating both convergence-free geographic routing and convergence-isolated routing. Furthermore, BlockFLEX adaptively switches between stateful and stateless forwarding modes, enabling efficient, resilient, and stable routing via a dedicated protection mechanism and an optimized source satellite selection algorithm.
  Experimental evaluations on current operational LEO satellite networks (LSNs) demonstrate that under scenarios with up to 30\% random link failures, the proposed method achieves a $2\times$ improvement in reachability compared to current leading schemes, while maintaining near-100\% routing availability. Moreover, the overhead of control messages and forwarding information base (FIB) updates remains below $0.2\%$ of that in OSPF, accompanied by a $\geq 36\%$ reduction in routing computation time and a $\geq 50\%$ decrease in latency jitter.</description>

      <title>M3Net: A Multi-Metric Mixture of Experts Network Digital Twin with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of 5G/6G network technologies promises to enable applications like autonomous vehicles and virtual reality, resulting in a significant increase in connected devices and necessarily complicating network management. Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow</description>

      <title>Towards Practical and Usable In-network Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09809v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-network machine learning enables real-time classification directly on network hardware, offering consistently low inference latency. However, current solutions are limited by strict hardware constraints, scarce on-device resources, and poor usability, making them impractical for ML developers and cloud operators. To this end, we propose ACORN, an end-to-end system that automates the distributed deployment of practical machine learning models across the network. ACORN provides a fully automated pipeline that loads and deploys Python ML models on network devices using an optimized deployment plan from an ILP planner. To support larger models under hardware constraints and allow runtime programmability, ACORN adopts a novel data plane representation for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models. We implement ACORN prototype in P4 and run it on real programmable hardware. Our evaluation shows ACORN can deploy classification ML models with 2-4x more features than state-of-the-art solutions, while imposing negligible overhead on network performance and traffic. We will make our data plane program, model translator, optimizer, and all related scripts publicly available.</description>

      <title>Link-Sharing Backpressure Routing In Wireless Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is an established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, noted for its fully distributed operation and maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead. Numerical results show that MaxU SP-BP substantially mitigates the last-packet problem and slightly expands the network capacity region.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Bayesian Optimization for Quantum Circuit Architecture Search with Uncertainty Calibrated Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.</description>

      <title>CardioLive: Empowering Video Streaming with Online Cardiac Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Cardiac Monitoring (OCM) emerges as a compelling enhancement for the next-generation video streaming platforms. It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.</description>
