      <title>Analysis of Fractional Vegetation Coverage and its Dynamic Change in the Yalong River Basin based on Dimidiate Pixel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and its spatio-temporal variations are critical indicators of regional ecological changes, which are of great significance to study the laws of surface variation and analyze regional ecosystem. Under the development of RS and GIS technology, this analysis employs Landsat satellite images in 1994, 2008, 2013 and 2016 to estimate FVC in Yalong River Basin based on the Dimidiate Pixel Model. With consideration of the vegetation coverage condition and land surface law in the study area, the research further analyzes the Spatio-temporal variations as well as the influencing factors of FVC in terms of topography and land use types respectively. The results show that since 1994, FVC in Yalong River Basin has experienced a downward trend yet displaying an uptick from 2013. Moreover, different land use types indicate the versatility of land covers in Yalong River Basin, with grassland and forest performing probably the most important factors that can induce changes to the stability of FVC in whole basin. Overall, the research reflects the impact of human activities on vegetation in Yalong River Basin, and provides available data and theoretical basis for ecological assessment, ecological restoration and environmental protection.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Impulsive Releases in Species Competition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on optimizing species release $S_2$ to control species population $S_1$ through impulsive release strategies. We investigate the conditions required to remove species $S_1$, which is equivalent to the establishment of $S_2$. The research includes a theoretical analysis that examines the positivity, existence, and uniqueness of solutions and the conditions for the global stability of the $S_1$-free solution. In addition, we formulate an optimal control problem to maximize the effectiveness of $S_2$ releases, manage the population of $S_1$, and minimize the costs associated with this intervention strategy. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the proposed theories and allow visualization of population dynamics under various releases scenarios.</description>

      <title>A new stochastic SIS-type modelling framework for analysing epidemic dynamics in continuous space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic epidemiological model defined in a continuous space of arbitrary dimension, based on SIS dynamics implemented in a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot (SLFV) process. The model can be described by as little as three parameters, and is dual to a spatial branching process with competition linked to genealogies of infected individuals. Therefore, it is a possible modelling framework to develop computationally tractable inference tools for epidemics in a continuous space using demographic and genetic data.
  We provide mathematical constructions of the process based on well-posed martingale problems as well as driving space-time Poisson point processes. With these devices and the duality relation in hand, we unveil some of the drivers of the transition between extinction and survival of the epidemic. In particular, we show that extinction is in large parts independent of the initial condition, and identify a strong candidate for the reproduction number $R_0$ of the epidemic in such a model.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the incidence rate and mortality rate ratio for chronic conditions based on aggregated current status data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that the transition rates of the illness-death model (IDM) for chronic conditions are related to the percentages of people in the states by a three-dimensional system of differential equations [Bri24]. The aim of this article is to introduce a method to estimate the age-specific incidence rate together with the mortality rate ratio from aggregated current status (ACS) data. By ACS data we mean counts of (non-necessarily different) people in the three states of the IDM at different points in time. ACS data stem from epidemiological studies where only current disease status and vital status data need to be collected without following-up people (as, for example, in cohort studies). As an application, we use the theory in a simulation study about diabetes in Germany with 600 study subjects at eleven repeated cross-sections each of which with 50% participation quote. Special focus is given to stochastic dependency of the sampled participants. We find a good agreement between the estimates and the input parameters used for the simulation.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of random-matrix universality in persistent Lotka--Volterra communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of a random matrix often only depends on the first and second moments of its elements, but not on the specific distribution from which they are drawn. The validity of this universality principle is often assumed without proof in applications. In this letter, we offer a pertinent counterexample in the context of the generalised Lotka--Volterra equations. Using dynamic mean-field theory, we derive the statistics of the interactions between species in an evolved ecological community. We then show that the full statistics of these interactions, beyond those of a Gaussian ensemble, are required to correctly predict the eigenvalue spectrum and therefore stability. Consequently, the universality principle fails in this system. We thus show that the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices can be used to deduce the stability of `feasible' ecological communities, but only if the emergent non-Gaussian statistics of the interactions between species are taken into account.</description>

      <title>A path integral approach to sparse non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of large random matrices has proved an invaluable tool for the study of systems with disordered interactions in many quite disparate research areas. Widely applicable results, such as the celebrated elliptic law for dense random matrices, allow one to deduce the statistical properties of the interactions in a complex dynamical system that permit stability. However, such simple and universal results have so far proved difficult to come by in the case of sparse random matrices. Here, we perform an expansion in the inverse connectivity, and thus derive general modified versions of the classic elliptic and semi-circle laws, taking into account the sparse correction. This is accomplished using a dynamical approach, which maps the hermitized resolvent of a random matrix onto the response functions of a linear dynamical system. The response functions are then evaluated using a path integral formalism, enabling one to construct Feynman diagrams, which facilitate the perturbative analysis. Additionally, in order to demonstrate the broad utility of the path integral framework, we derive a generic non-Hermitian generalization of the Marchenko-Pastur law, and we also show how one can handle non-negligible higher-order statistics (i.e. non-Gaussian statistics) in dense ensembles.</description>
