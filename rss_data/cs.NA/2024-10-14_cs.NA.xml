      <title>Matrix-free stochastic calculation of operator norms without using adjoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of computing the operator norm of a linear map between finite dimensional Hilbert spaces when only evaluations of the linear map are available and under restrictive storage assumptions.
  We propose a stochastic method of random search type for the maximization of the Rayleigh quotient and employ an exact line search in the random search directions.
  Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to the global maximum (the operator norm) almost surely and illustrate the performance of the method with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Computing Generalized Eigenfunctions in Rigged Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, general, and convergent scheme to compute generalized eigenfunctions of self-adjoint operators with continuous spectra on rigged Hilbert spaces. Our approach does not require prior knowledge about the eigenfunctions, such as asymptotics or other analytic properties. Instead, we carefully sample the range of the resolvent operator to construct smooth and accurate wave packet approximations to generalized eigenfunctions. We prove high-order convergence in key topologies, including weak-star convergence for distributional eigenfunctions, uniform convergence on compact sets for locally smooth generalized eigenfunctions, and convergence in seminorms for separable Frechet spaces, covering the majority of physical scenarios. The method's performance is illustrated with applications to both differential and integral operators, culminating in the computation of spectral measures and generalized eigenfunctions for an operator associated with Poincare's internal waves problem. These computations corroborate experimental results and highlight the method's utility for a broad range of spectral problems in physics.</description>

      <title>The Proof of Kolmogorov-Arnold May Illuminate Neural Network Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov and Arnold, in answering Hilbert's 13th problem (in the context of continuous functions), laid the foundations for the modern theory of Neural Networks (NNs). Their proof divides the representation of a multivariate function into two steps: The first (non-linear) inter-layer map gives a universal embedding of the data manifold into a single hidden layer whose image is patterned in such a way that a subsequent dynamic can then be defined to solve for the second inter-layer map. I interpret this pattern as "minor concentration" of the almost everywhere defined Jacobians of the interlayer map. Minor concentration amounts to sparsity for higher exterior powers of the Jacobians. We present a conceptual argument for how such sparsity may set the stage for the emergence of successively higher order concepts in today's deep NNs and suggest two classes of experiments to test this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A Flexible GMRES Solver with Reduced Order Model Enhanced Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioenr for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) occurs in multi-query applications such as uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, and sensitivity analysis, requiring the solution of the RTE multiple times for a range of parameters. Consequently, efficient iterative solvers are highly desired.
  Classical Synthetic Acceleration (SA) preconditioners for RTE build on low order approximations to an ideal kinetic correction equation such as its diffusion limit in Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA). Their performance depends on the effectiveness of the underlying low-order approximation. In addition, they do not leverage low-rank structures with respect to the parameters of the parametric problem.
  To address these issues, we proposed a ROM-enhanced SA strategy, called ROMSAD, for Source Iteration in Peng (2024). In this paper, we further extend the ROMSAD preconditioner to flexible general minimal residual method (FGMRES). Specifically, We identify the ideal correction equation within the FGMRES framework and develop an iterative procedure to construct a ROM for this ideal correction equation without directly solving it. Additionally, we introduce a greedy algorithm to more efficiently build the underlying ROM for the ROMSAD preconditioner.
  Our numerical examples demonstrate that FGMRES with the ROMSAD preconditioner (FGMRES-ROMSAD) is more efficient than GMRES with the right DSA preconditioner. Furthermore, when the underlying ROM in ROMSAD is not highly accurate, FGMRES-ROMSAD exhibits greater robustness compared to Source Iteration accelerated by ROMSAD.</description>

      <title>Solvers for mixed finite element problems using Poincar\'e operators based on spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explicit construction of Poincar\'e operators for the lowest order finite element spaces, by employing spanning trees in the grid. In turn, a stable decomposition of the discrete spaces is derived that leads to an efficient numerical solver for the Hodge-Laplace problem. The solver consists of solving four smaller, symmetric positive definite systems. We moreover place the decomposition in the framework of auxiliary space preconditioning and propose robust preconditioners for elliptic mixed finite element problems. The efficiency of the approach is validated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The velocity jump Langevin process and its splitting scheme: long time convergence and numerical accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Langevin dynamics is a diffusion process extensively used, in particular in molecular dynamics simu-lations, to sample Gibbs measures. Some alternatives based on (piecewise deterministic) kinetic velocity jumpprocesses have gained interest over the last decade. One interest of the latter is the possibility to split forces(at the continuous-time level), reducing the numerical cost for sampling the trajectory. Motivated by this, anumerical scheme based on hybrid dynamics combining velocity jumps and Langevin diffusion, numericallymore efficient than their classical Langevin counterparts, has been introduced for computational chemistry in [42]. The present work is devoted to the numerical analysis of this scheme. Our main results are, first, theexponential ergodicity of the continuous-time velocity jump Langevin process, second, a Talay-Tubaro expan-sion of the invariant measure of the numerical scheme, showing in particular that the scheme is of weak order2 in the step-size and, third, a bound on the quadratic risk of the corresponding practical MCMC estimator(possibly with Richardson extrapolation). With respect to previous works on the Langevin diffusion, newdifficulties arise from the jump operator, which is non-local.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of a Schrodinger Problem with Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the mathematical analysis of the convergence of the linearized Crank-Nicolson Galerkin method for a nonlinear Schrodinger problem related to a domain with a moving boundary. The convergence analysis of the numerical method is carried out for both semi-discrete and fully discrete problems. An optimal error estimate in the $L^2$-norm with order ${O}(\tau^2+ h^s),~ 2\leq s\leq r$, where $h$ is the finite element mesh size parameter, $\tau$ is the time step, and $r-1$ represents the degree of the finite element polynomial basis. Numerical simulations are provided to confirm the consistency between theoretical and numerical results, validating the method and the order of convergence for different degrees $p\geq 1$ of the Lagrange polynomials and also for Hermite polynomials (degree $p=3$), which form the basis of the approximate solution.</description>

      <title>Rapid Grassmannian Averaging with Chebyshev Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new algorithms to efficiently average a collection of points on a Grassmannian manifold in both the centralized and decentralized settings. Grassmannian points are used ubiquitously in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing to represent data through (often low-dimensional) subspaces. While averaging these points is crucial to many tasks (especially in the decentralized setting), existing methods unfortunately remain computationally expensive due to the non-Euclidean geometry of the manifold. Our proposed algorithms, Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (RGrAv) and Decentralized Rapid Grassmannian Averaging (DRGrAv), overcome this challenge by leveraging the spectral structure of the problem to rapidly compute an average using only small matrix multiplications and QR factorizations. We provide a theoretical guarantee of optimality and present numerical experiments which demonstrate that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods in providing high accuracy solutions in minimal time. Additional experiments showcase the versatility of our algorithms to tasks such as K-means clustering on video motion data, establishing RGrAv and DRGrAv as powerful tools for generic Grassmannian averaging.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation principles for finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unique continuation principles are fundamental properties of elliptic partial differential equations, giving conditions that guarantee that the solution to an elliptic equation must be uniformly zero. Since finite-element discretizations are a natural tool to help gain understanding into elliptic equations, it is natural to ask if such principles also hold at the discrete level. In this work, we prove a version of the unique continuation principle for piecewise-linear and -bilinear finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian eigenvalue problem on polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Namely, we show that any solution to the discretized equation $-\Delta u = \lambda u$ with vanishing Dirichlet and Neumann traces must be identically zero under certain geometric and topological assumptions on the resulting triangulation. We also provide a counterexample, showing that a nonzero \emph{inner solution} exists when the topological assumptions are not satisfied. Finally, we give an application to an eigenvalue interlacing problem, where the space of inner solutions makes an explicit appearance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berry phases offer a geometric perspective on wave propagation and are key to designing materials with topological wave transport. However, controlling Berry phases is challenging due to their dependence on global integrals over the Brillouin zone, making differentiation difficult. We present an adjoint-based method for efficiently computing the gradient of the Berry phase with respect to system parameters, involving only one forward and one adjoint calculation. This approach enables the use of advanced optimization techniques, such as topology optimization, to design new materials with tailored topological wave properties.</description>

      <title>Changes in Fluctuation Waves in Coherent Airflow Structures with Input Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the development and propagation of the fluctuations in a perturbed ideally-expanded air jet. A non-propagating harmonic perturbation in the density, axial velocity, and pressure is introduced at the inflow with different frequencies to produce coherent structures in the airflow, which are synchronized with the applied frequency. Then, the fluctuations and acoustic fields are predicted for each frequency by integrating the axisymmetric linearized Euler equations. We investigate the effect of the perturbation frequency on different characteristics of the pressure and velocity waves. The perturbation frequency can be used to alter the propagation pattern and intensity of the waves and mitigate the noise levels at certain zones.</description>

      <title>Distillation of Discrete Diffusion through Dimensional Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performances in various fields of generative modeling. While they often outperform competitors including VAEs and GANs in sample quality and diversity, they suffer from slow sampling speed due to their iterative nature. Recently, distillation techniques and consistency models are mitigating this issue in continuous domains, but discrete diffusion models have some specific challenges towards faster generation. Most notably, in the current literature, correlations between different dimensions (pixels, locations) are ignored, both by its modeling and loss functions, due to computational limitations. In this paper, we propose "mixture" models in discrete diffusion that are capable of treating dimensional correlations while remaining scalable, and we provide a set of loss functions for distilling the iterations of existing models. Two primary theoretical insights underpin our approach: first, that dimensionally independent models can well approximate the data distribution if they are allowed to conduct many sampling steps, and second, that our loss functions enables mixture models to distill such many-step conventional models into just a few steps by learning the dimensional correlations. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method for discrete diffusions work in practice, by distilling a continuous-time discrete diffusion model pretrained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are notorious for scaling cubically with the size of the training set, preventing application to very large regression problems. Computation-aware Gaussian processes (CAGPs) tackle this scaling issue by exploiting probabilistic linear solvers to reduce complexity, widening the posterior with additional computational uncertainty due to reduced computation. However, the most commonly used CAGP framework results in (sometimes dramatically) conservative uncertainty quantification, making the posterior unrealistic in practice. In this work, we prove that if the utilised probabilistic linear solver is calibrated, in a rigorous statistical sense, then so too is the induced CAGP. We thus propose a new CAGP framework, CAGP-GS, based on using Gauss-Seidel iterations for the underlying probabilistic linear solver. CAGP-GS performs favourably compared to existing approaches when the test set is low-dimensional and few iterations are performed. We test the calibratedness on a synthetic problem, and compare the performance to existing approaches on a large-scale global temperature regression problem.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Deep Learning Method for Solving Nonlocal Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient end-to-end deep learning method for solving nonlocal Allen-Cahn (AC) and Cahn-Hilliard (CH) phase-field models. One motivation for this effort emanates from the fact that discretized partial differential equation-based AC or CH phase-field models result in diffuse interfaces between phases, with the only recourse for remediation is to severely refine the spatial grids in the vicinity of the true moving sharp interface whose width is determined by a grid-independent parameter that is substantially larger than the local grid size. In this work, we introduce non-mass conserving nonlocal AC or CH phase-field models with regular, logarithmic, or obstacle double-well potentials. Because of non-locality, some of these models feature totally sharp interfaces separating phases. The discretization of such models can lead to a transition between phases whose width is only a single grid cell wide. Another motivation is to use deep learning approaches to ameliorate the otherwise high cost of solving discretized nonlocal phase-field models. To this end, loss functions of the customized neural networks are defined using the residual of the fully discrete approximations of the AC or CH models, which results from applying a Fourier collocation method and a temporal semi-implicit approximation. To address the long-range interactions in the models, we tailor the architecture of the neural network by incorporating a nonlocal kernel as an input channel to the neural network model. We then provide the results of extensive computational experiments to illustrate the accuracy, structure-preserving properties, predictive capabilities, and cost reductions of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Gradient-adjusted underdamped Langevin dynamics for sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a target distribution is a fundamental problem. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), derived from the overdamped Langevin dynamics, have been extensively studied. From an optimization perspective, the Kolmogorov forward equation of the overdamped Langevin dynamics can be treated as the gradient flow of the relative entropy in the space of probability densities embedded with Wassrstein-2 metrics. Several efforts have also been devoted to including momentum-based methods, such as underdamped Langevin dynamics for faster convergence of sampling algorithms. Recent advances in optimizations have demonstrated the effectiveness of primal-dual damping and Hessian-driven damping dynamics for achieving faster convergence in solving optimization problems. Motivated by these developments, we introduce a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) called gradient-adjusted underdamped Langevin dynamics (GAUL), which add stochastic perturbations in primal-dual damping dynamics and Hessian-driven damping dynamics from optimization. We prove that GAUL admits the correct stationary distribution, whose marginal is the target distribution. The proposed method outperforms overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics regarding convergence speed in the total variation distance for Gaussian target distributions. Moreover, using the Euler-Maruyama discretization, we show that the mixing time towards a biased target distribution only depends on the square root of the condition number of the target covariance matrix. Numerical experiments for non-Gaussian target distributions, such as Bayesian regression problems and Bayesian neural networks, further illustrate the advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Faber--Schauder approximation based on discrete observations of an antiderivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11907v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing the Faber--Schauder coefficients of a continuous function $f$ from discrete observations of its antiderivative $F$. For instance, this question arises in financial mathematics when estimating the roughness of volatility from the integrated volatility of an asset price trajectory. Our approach starts with mathematically formulating the reconstruction problem through piecewise quadratic spline interpolation. We then provide a closed-form solution and an in-depth error analysis. These results lead to some surprising observations, which also throw new light on the classical topic of quadratic spline interpolation itself: They show that the well-known instabilities of this method can be located exclusively within the final generation of estimated Faber--Schauder coefficients, which suffer from non-locality and strong dependence on the initial value. By contrast, all other Faber--Schauder coefficients depend only locally on the data, are independent of the initial value, and admit uniform error bounds. We thus conclude that a robust and well-behaved estimator for our problem can be obtained by simply dropping the final-generation coefficients from the estimated Faber--Schauder coefficients.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a FEM-MCM Discretization for the 2D/3D stochastic closed-loop geothermal system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a new 2D/3D stochastic closed-loop geothermal system with a random hydraulic conductivity tensor. We use the finite element method (FEM) and the Monte Carlo method (MCM) to discrete physical and probability spaces, respectively. This FEM-MCM method is effective. The stability for velocity and temperature is rigorously proved. Compared with the deterministic closed-loop geothermal system, a same optimal error estimate for approximate velocity and temperature is obtained. Furthermore, a series of numerical experiments were carried out to show this method has better stability and accuracy results.</description>

      <title>Finding roots of complex analytic functions via generalized colleague matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme for finding all roots of an analytic function in a square domain in the complex plane. The scheme can be viewed as a generalization of the classical approach to finding roots of a function on the real line, by first approximating it by a polynomial in the Chebyshev basis, followed by diagonalizing the so-called ''colleague matrices''. Our extension of the classical approach is based on several observations that enable the construction of polynomial bases in compact domains that satisfy three-term recurrences and are reasonably well-conditioned. This class of polynomial bases gives rise to ''generalized colleague matrices'', whose eigenvalues are roots of functions expressed in these bases. In this paper, we also introduce a special-purpose QR algorithm for finding the eigenvalues of generalized colleague matrices, which is a straightforward extension of the recently introduced componentwise stable QR algorithm for the classical cases (See [Serkh]). The performance of the schemes is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Reduced Basis Trust Region Methods for Parameter Identification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we are concerned with model order reduction in the context of iterative regularization methods for the solution of inverse problems arising from parameter identification in elliptic partial differential equations. Such methods typically require a large number of forward solutions, which makes the use of the reduced basis method attractive to reduce computational complexity. However, the considered inverse problems are typically ill-posed due to their infinite-dimensional parameter space. Moreover, the infinite-dimensional parameter space makes it impossible to build and certify classical reduced-order models efficiently in a so-called "offline phase". We thus propose a new algorithm that adaptively builds a reduced parameter space in the online phase. The enrichment of the reduced parameter space is naturally inherited from the Tikhonov regularization within an iteratively regularized Gau{\ss}-Newton method. Finally, the adaptive parameter space reduction is combined with a certified reduced basis state space reduction within an adaptive error-aware trust region framework. Numerical experiments are presented to show the efficiency of the combined parameter and state space reduction for inverse parameter identification problems with distributed reaction or diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Multi-Derivative Runge-Kutta Flux Reconstruction for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the fourth order, two stage Multi-Derivative Runge Kutta (MDRK) scheme to the Flux Reconstruction (FR) framework by writing both stages in terms of a time averaged flux and then using the approximate Lax-Wendroff procedure to compute the time averaged flux. Numerical flux is carefully constructed to enhance Fourier CFL stability and accuracy. A subcell based blending limiter is developed for the MDRK scheme which ensures that the limited scheme is provably admissibility preserving. Along with being admissibility preserving, the blending scheme is constructed to minimize dissipation errors by using Gauss-Legendre solution points and performing MUSCL-Hancock reconstruction on subcells. The accuracy enhancement of the blending scheme is numerically verified on compressible Euler's equations, with test cases involving shocks and small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Efficient preconditioners for coupled Stokes-Darcy problems with MAC scheme: Spectral analysis and numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled systems of free flow and porous media arise in a variety of technical and environmental applications. For laminar flow regimes, such systems are described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow region and Darcy's law in the porous medium. An appropriate set of coupling conditions is needed on the fluid-porous interface. Discretisations of the Stokes-Darcy problems yield large, sparse, ill-conditioned, and, depending on the interface conditions, non-symmetric linear systems. Therefore, robust and efficient preconditioners are needed to accelerate convergence of the applied Krylov method. In this work, we consider the second order MAC scheme for the coupled Stokes-Darcy problems and develop and investigate block diagonal, block triangular and constraint preconditioners. We apply two classical sets of coupling conditions considering the Beavers-Joseph and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition for the tangential velocity. For the Beavers-Joseph interface condition, the resulting system is non-symmetric, therefore GMRES method is used for both cases. Spectral analysis is conducted for the exact versions of the preconditioners identifying clusters and bounds. Furthermore, for practical use we develop efficient inexact versions of the preconditioners. We demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed preconditioners in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>H-Matrix Accelerated Direct Matrix Solver for Maxwell's Equations using the Chebyshev-based Nystr\"om Boundary Integral Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An H-matrix accelerated direct solver employing the high-order Chebyshev-based Boundary Integral Equation (CBIE) method has been formulated, tested, and profiled for performance on high contrast dielectric materials and electrically large perfect electric conductor objects. The matrix fill performance of the CBIE proves to be fast for small to moderately sized problems compared to its counterparts, e.g. the locally corrected Nystr\"om (LCN) method, due to the way it handles the singularities by means of a global change of variable method. However, in the case of electrically large scattering problems, the matrix fill and factorization still dominate the solution time when using a direct solution approach. To address this issue, an H-Matrix framework is employed, effectively resolving the challenge and establishing the CBIE as a competitive high-order method for solving scattering problems with poorly conditioned matrix equations. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through extensive numerical results, showcasing its robustness to problems that are electrically large, near physical resonances, or that have large dielectric permittivities. The capability of the proposed solver for handling arbitrary geometries is also demonstrated by considering various scattering examples from complex CAD models.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing the Consistent Quasidiffusion Method with Linear Prolongation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasidiffusion (QD) method, also known as the Variable Eddington Factor (VEF) method in the astrophysical community, is an established iterative method for accelerating source iterations in SN calculations. A great advantage of the QD method is that the diffusion equation that accelerates the SN source iterations can be discretized in any valid discretization without concern for consistency with the transport discretization. QD has comparable effectiveness with diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA), but the converged scalar flux of the diffusion equation will differ from the transport solution by the spatial truncation errors. Larsen et al. introduced a new consistent QD method (CQD), which includes a straightforwardly defined transport consistency factor closely related to the well-known coarse mesh finite difference (CMFD) and DSA methods. The CQD method preserves the discretized scalar flux solution of the SN equations, and it is stable for problems with optically thin spatial cells, but just like nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA), it degrades in performance and eventually becomes unstable when the spatial cells become greater than about one mean free path thick. In this paper, we performed a formal Fourier analysis of the CQD method to show that its theoretical spectral radius is essentially the same as that of the NDA method. To improve the stability of CQD, we introduce the lpCQD method, which adopts the idea of the linear prolongation CMFD (lpCMFD) method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <title>Efficient, Multimodal, and Derivative-Free Bayesian Inference With Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible.
  While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii).
  The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on automatic differentiation with complex numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation is everywhere, but there exists only minimal documentation of how it works in complex arithmetic beyond stating "derivatives in $\mathbb{C}^d$" $\cong$ "derivatives in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$" and, at best, shallow references to Wirtinger calculus. Unfortunately, the equivalence $\mathbb{C}^d \cong \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ becomes insufficient as soon as we need to derive custom gradient rules, e.g., to avoid differentiating "through" expensive linear algebra functions or differential equation simulators. To combat such a lack of documentation, this article surveys forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation with complex numbers, covering topics such as Wirtinger derivatives, a modified chain rule, and different gradient conventions while explicitly avoiding holomorphicity and the Cauchy--Riemann equations (which would be far too restrictive). To be precise, we will derive, explain, and implement a complex version of Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products almost entirely with linear algebra without relying on complex analysis or differential geometry. This tutorial is a call to action, for users and developers alike, to take complex values seriously when implementing custom gradient propagation rules -- the manuscript explains how.</description>
