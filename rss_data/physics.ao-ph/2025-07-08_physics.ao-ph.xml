      <title>Deep Learning Atmospheric Models Reliably Simulate Out-of-Sample Land Heat and Cold Wave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over 1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960). Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during 1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.</description>

      <title>Ice clouds as nonlinear oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clouds are important features of the atmosphere, determining the energy budget by interacting with incoming solar radiation and outgoing thermal radiation, respectively. For pure ice clouds, the net effect of radiative effect is still unknown. In this study we develop a simple but physically consistent ice cloud model, and analyze it using methods from the theory of dynamical systems. We find that the model constitutes a nonlinear oscillator with two Hopf bifurcations in the relevant parameter regime. In addition to the characterization of the equilibrium states and the occurring limit cycle, we find scaling behaviors of the bifurcations and the limit cycle, reducing the parameter space crucially. Finally, the model shows very good agreement with real measurements, indicating that the main physics is captured and such simple models are helpful tools for investigating ice clouds.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Urban Heat Mitigation: Attribution and Weighting of Multi-Scale Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features, respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency, a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator for Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to a Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model (WRF-SLUCM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature (T2). Using random forests (RFs) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained on WRF-SLUCM output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in 2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers - most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in training. With RF-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce statistical uncertainties and testing the method on other cities, the proposed approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI mitigation assessment.</description>

      <title>Drivers of Layered Circulations in the South China Sea: Volume Flux or Vorticity Flux?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The South China Sea (SCS) features a unique layered circulation structure known as the cyclonic-anticyclonic-cyclonic (CAC) pattern, whose driving mechanisms remain a subject of debate. This study employs idealized numerical simulations using the MITgcm to investigate the role of volume flux and vorticity flux through the Luzon Strait (LS) to the SCS circulation. The control experiment successfully reproduces the observed "sandwiched" transport structure at the LS and the CAC circulation within the SCS. Sensitivity experiments, in which planetary vorticity is set to zero in the Pacific and LS, reveal that the CAC structure is insensitive to vorticity flux input. By applying the Stommel-Arons model to Cartesian coordinates, we provide analytical solutions that align with the simulation results, supporting the volume flux-driven hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the deep inflow through the LS is the primary driver of the layered circulation system, while the middle-layer outflow is a dynamical consequence. These results challenge the vorticity flux-driven hypothesis and offer new insights into the dynamics of layered circulations in the SCS.</description>

      <title>Neural Dynamic Modes: Computational Imaging of Dynamical Systems from Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins. Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy, and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Do Tensorized Large-Scale Spatiotemporal Dynamic Atmospheric Data Exhibit Low-Rank Properties?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS). Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and improving wave and non-wave stress parametrisations for oceanic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whenever oceanic currents flow over rough topography, there is an associated stress that acts to modify the flow. In the deep ocean, this stress is predominantly form drag, caused by the formation of internal waves and other baroclinic motions: processes that act on such small scales most global ocean models cannot resolve. Despite the need to incorporate this stress into ocean models, existing parametrisations are limited in their applicability. For instance, most parametrisations are only suitable for small-scale topography and are either for periodic or steady flows, but rarely a combination thereof. Here we summarise these existing parametrisations and evaluate their accuracy using hundreds of idealised two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations spanning a wide parameter space. In cases where the parametrisations prove to be in inaccurate, we use our data to suggest improved formulations. Our results thus provide a basis for a comprehensive parameterisation of stress in ocean models where fine scale topography is unresolved.</description>

      <title>Improving Predictions of Convective Storm Wind Gusts through Statistical Post-Processing of Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Issuing timely severe weather warnings helps mitigate potentially disastrous consequences. Recent advancements in Neural Weather Models (NWMs) offer a computationally inexpensive and fast approach for forecasting atmospheric environments on a 0.25{\deg} global grid. For thunderstorms, these environments can be empirically post-processed to predict wind gust distributions at specific locations. With the Pangu-Weather NWM, we apply a hierarchy of statistical and deep learning post-processing methods to forecast hourly wind gusts up to three days ahead. To ensure statistical robustness, we constrain our probabilistic forecasts using generalised extreme-value distributions across five regions in Switzerland. Using a convolutional neural network to post-process the predicted atmospheric environment's spatial patterns yields the best results, outperforming direct forecasting approaches across lead times and wind gust speeds. Our results confirm the added value of NWMs for extreme wind forecasting, especially for designing more responsive early-warning systems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Tiered Bayesian Network Coastal Compound Flood Analysis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coastal compound floods (CCFs) are triggered by the interaction of multiple mechanisms, such as storm surges, storm rainfall, tides, and river flow. These events can bring significant damage to communities, and there is an increasing demand for accurate and efficient probabilistic analyses of CCFs to support risk assessments and decision-making. In this study, a multi-tiered Bayesian network (BN) CCF analysis framework is established. In this framework, conceptual designs of multiple tiers of BN models with varying complexities are developed for application with varying levels of data availability and resources. A case study is conducted in New Orleans, LA, with three tiers of BN models constructed to demonstrate this framework. In the Tier-1 BN model, storm surges and river flow are incorporated based on hydrodynamic simulations. A seasonality node is used to capture the dependence between concurrent river flow and tropical cyclone (TC) parameters. In the Tier-2 BN model, joint distribution models of TC parameters are built for separate TC intensity categories. TC-induced rainfall is modeled as input to hydraulic simulations. In the Tier-3 BN model, potential variations of meteorological conditions are incorporated by quantifying their effects on TC activity and coastal water level. Flood antecedent conditions are also incorporated to more completely represent the conditions contributing to flood severity. In this case study, a series of joint distribution, numerical, machine learning, and experimental models are used to compute conditional probability tables needed for the BNs. A series of probabilistic analyses is performed based on these BN models, including CCF hazard curve construction and CCF deaggregation. The results of the analysis demonstrate the promise of this framework in performing CCF hazard analysis under varying levels of resource availability and project needs.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by vorticity and convergence values larger than the local Coriolis frequency, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a provable finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward linear Poisson problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Taken together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ might be a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</description>
