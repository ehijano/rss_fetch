      <title>Ensemble nonlinear optical learner by electrically tunable linear scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in effective nonlinearity, achieved by exploiting multiple scatterings within the linear optical regime, has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to enable nonlinear optical processing without relying on actual material nonlinearity. Here we introduce an ensemble nonlinear optical learner, via electrically tunable linear scattering in a liquid-crystal-polymer composite film under low optical power and low applied electrical voltages. We demonstrate, through several image classification tasks, that by combining inference results from an ensemble of nonlinear optical learners realized at different applied voltages, the ensemble optical learning significantly outperforms the classification performance of individual processors. With very low-level optical power and electrical voltage requirements, and ease in reconfiguration simply by varying applied voltages, the ensemble nonlinear optical learning offers a cost-effective and flexible way to improve computing performance and enhance inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Assisted Photonic Device Development: A Multiscale Approach from Theory to Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging, sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters, ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization, material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods. However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the development of complex photonic devices and systems.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS): Comprehensive Absorption Imaging Enabling Label-Free Biomolecule Characterization and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-free optical absorption microscopy techniques continue to evolve as promising tools for label-free histopathological imaging of cells and tissues. However, critical challenges relating to specificity and contrast, as compared to current gold-standard methods continue to hamper adoption. This work introduces Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), a new absorption microscope modality, which simultaneously captures the dominant de-excitation processes following an absorption event. In PARS, radiative (auto-fluorescence) and non-radiative (photothermal and photoacoustic) relaxation processes are collected simultaneously, providing enhanced specificity to a range of biomolecules. As an example, a multiwavelength PARS system featuring UV (266 nm) and visible (532 nm) excitation is applied to imaging human skin, and murine brain tissue samples. It is shown that PARS can directly characterize, differentiate, and unmix, clinically relevant biomolecules inside complex tissues samples using established statistical processing methods. Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are used to characterize clinically relevant biomolecules (e.g., white, and gray matter) based on their PARS signals, while non-negative least squares (NNLS) is applied to map the biomolecule abundance in murine brain tissues, without stained ground truth images or deep-learning methods. PARS unmixing and abundance estimates are directly validated and compared against chemically stained ground truth images, and deep learning based-image transforms. Overall, it is found that the PARS unique and rich contrast may provide comprehensive, and otherwise inaccessible, label-free characterization of molecular pathology, representing a new source of data to develop AI and machine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization.</description>

      <title>Integrated optomechanical ultrasonic sensors with nano-Pascal-level sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasonic sensors are widely used for object detection and localization in underwater and biological settings. The operational range and spatial resolution are inherently limited by sensor sensitivity, in which conventional piezoelectric transducers have been overwhelmed by advanced photonic sensors. Here, we demonstrate an optomechanical ultrasonic sensor integrated into a photonic platform, which comprises a suspended SiO2 membrane embedded with a high-Q Si3N4 microring resonator. By exploiting simultaneous optical and mechanical resonances, the sensor achieves a record low noise-equivalent pressure (NEP) of 218 nPa/Hz^1/2 at 289 kHz in air and 9.6 nPa/Hz^1/2 at 52 kHz in water. We demonstrate its versatility through photoacoustic gas spectroscopy in air and underwater ultrasound imaging, achieving a minimum detectable C2H2 concentration of 2.9 ppm (integration time 1 s) and an imaging resolution of 1.89 mm, respectively. Our work represents a significant advancement in compact CMOS-compatible ultrasound sensing, unlocking new possibilities in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, industrial testing, and underwater communications.</description>

      <title>Efficient first-principles inverse design of nanolasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and demonstrate a first-principles approach, based on the nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations and steady-state ab-initio laser theory (SALT), for inverse design of nanostructured lasers, incorporating spatial hole-burning corrections, threshold effects, out-coupling efficiency, and gain diffusion. The resulting figure of merit exploits the high-$Q$ regime of optimized laser cavities to perturbatively simplify the nonlinear model to a single linear ''reciprocal'' Maxwell solve. The consequences for laser-cavity design, and in particular the strong dependence on the nature of the gain region, are demonstrated using topology optimization of both 2d and full 3d geometries.</description>

      <title>Orbital chiral lasing in twisted bilayer metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is a fundamental concept in physics that underpins various phenomena in nonlinear optics, quantum physics, and topological photonics. Although the spin of a photon naturally brings chirality, orbital angular momentum can also become chirally active in the structures with a broken mirror symmetry. Here, we observe orbital chiral lasing from a twisted bilayer photonic structure leveraging its inherent structural chirality. Specifically, we design and fabricate a Moire-type optical structure by bonding and rotating two separate semiconductor membrane metasurfaces. We achieve single-mode lasing over a broad spectral range of 250 nm by optically pumping the twisted structure. The lasing emission exhibits orbital chiral characteristics, arising from helical and non-Hermitian couplings between clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating collective guided resonances, confirmed by polarization-resolved imaging and self-interference patterns. Our results provide the first observation of orbital chiral lasing in twisted photonics, and they can contribute to diverse applications of chiral light in diagnostics, optical manipulation, and communication with light.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic effect in high order harmonic generation revealed by a fully analytical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fully analytical method for describing high-order harmonic generation (HHG). This method is based on the strong-field approximation (SFA) and utilizes the perturbation expansion method. Specifically, we expand the laser-induced dipole moment to third-order analytical expansion (TAE) and fifth-order expansion (FAE) with respect to the Keldysh parameter $\gamma$. The TAE method is suitable for $\gamma\leqslant0.27$, while the FAE method can be applied for $\gamma\leqslant 0.65$. We demonstrate that higher-order perturbation terms capture the nonadiabatic effect, while the zero-order term represents the adiabatic effect. Furthermore, we reveal that the nonadiabatic effect influences HHG intensity by impacting electron dynamics.</description>

      <title>SU(2) polarization evolution on higher-order Poincar\'e sphere by using general $q$-plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rotational dynamics on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere with the use of $q$-plate by exploring three key aspects: the topological condition, the global-local rotation, and the SU(2) polarization evolution on the sphere. The polarized light beam corresponding to this sphere and $q$-plates shares analogous topological features, characterized by azimuthal variation. We have formulated the topological condition that establishes a connection between the $q$-plate and the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere, enabling the SU(2) polarization evolution on the same higher-order Poincar\'e sphere. Leveraging this correspondence, we have shown that a single \textit{global} SO(3) rotation on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere is a collection of multiple \textit{local} SO(3) rotations on the standard Poincar\'e sphere. SO(3) is related to SU(2) through a two-to-one surjective homomorphism, with SU(2) serving as its double cover. Moreover, we demonstrate that a general $q$-plate, defined by a continuously tunable retardance ranging from $0$ to $2\pi$ and an offset angle ranging from $0$ to $\pi/2$, provides the complete coverage on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere.</description>

      <title>Broadband amplification of light through adiabatic spatiotemporal modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional optics leverages the simultaneous control of materials in space and time to manipulate light. A key challenge in experimentally realizing many intriguing phenomena is the need for rapid modulation, which is hindered by the inherently adiabatic relaxation of optical materials. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that broadband amplification can be achieved without the need for sub-cycle temporal responses, instead leveraging adiabatic spatiotemporal modulation patterns. The proposed modulation scheme is compatible with recent demonstrations of the temporal modulation of epsilon-near-zero materials. We also show that the same phenomenon may be realized by modulating bianisotropic nonreciprocal media in time. This broadband gain mechanism opens new avenues for the generation of high-energy, ultrashort optical pulses, with potential impact in ultrafast optics and electron microscopy.</description>

      <title>Programmable spatiotemporal OAM optical toroidal beams with completely tunable properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal toroidal orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams are a developing class of spatiotemporal beams which have key applications within quantum physics, metrology, imaging and optical manipulation. However, the full realization of these applications require complete configurability within tunable temporal duration, 3D geometric structure and OAM charge of these beams along with amplitude, phase and polarization control. In this paper, we demonstrate complete configurability of programmable, polarization-resolved OAM toroidal beams after propagation through a multimode optical fiber (MMF) supporting 90 spatial/polarization modes. We show high fidelity control: temporally with beams spanning 2.3 ps - 6.8 ps, geometrically with toroidal aspect ratios spanning 1.5-2.7 and with up to $|l|=13$ OAM topological charge. In total this system supports 25,000 spatiotemporal and polarization degrees of freedom which enables the independent control of all physical and geometric properties of these 3D toroidal beams. By utilizing an MMF, this system also enables toroidal beam delivery to previously inaccessible regions, paving the way for applications including optical manipulations, sensing and imaging through complex photonics media such as scattering biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of high compression of space by optical spaceplates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical size of optical imaging systems is one of the greatest constraints on their use, limiting the performance and deployment of a range of systems from telescopes to mobile phone cameras. Spaceplates are nonlocal optical devices that compress free-space propagation into a shorter distance, paving the way for more compact optical systems, potentially even thin flat cameras. Here, we demonstrate the first engineered optical spaceplate and experimentally observe the highest space compression ratios yet demonstrated in any wavelength region, up to $\mathcal{R}=176\pm14$, which is 29 times higher than any previous device. Our spaceplate is a multilayer stack, a well-established commercial fabrication technology that supports mass production. The versatility of these stacks allows for the freedom to customize the spaceplate's bandwidth and angular range, impossible with previous optical experimental spaceplates, which were made of bulk materials. With the appropriate choice of these two parameters, multilayer spaceplates have near-term applications in light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technologies, retinal scanners, endoscopes, and other size-constrained optical devices.</description>

      <title>Development of an Open-Source Spacecraft Bus for the PULSE-A CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The undergraduate-led Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) at the University of Chicago seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of circular polarization shift keyed satellite-to-ground laser communication. PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus.
  The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team.
  The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials in Superconducting and Cryogenic Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of fault-tolerant quantum computers based on superconducting circuits faces critical challenges in qubit coherence, connectivity, and scalability. This review establishes metamaterials, artificial structures with on-demand electromagnetic properties, as a transformative solution. By engineering the photonic density of states, metamaterials can suppress decoherence via the Purcell effect and create multi-mode quantum buses for hardware-efficient control and long-range qubit coupling. We provide a comprehensive overview, from foundational principles and Hamiltonian engineering to the materials science of high-coherence devices. We survey state-of-the-art performance, highlighting record coherence times and coupling strengths achieved through metamaterial design. Furthermore, we explore advanced applications where engineered environments give rise to exotic excitations and topologically protected states, enabling novel error correction schemes and qubit architectures. Ultimately, we argue that metamaterials are evolving from passive components into the core architectural element of next-generation quantum technologies, paving a viable path toward scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Versatile luminescence macroscope with dynamic illumination for photoactive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminescence imaging is invaluable for studying biological and material systems, particularly when advanced protocols that exploit temporal dynamics are employed. However, implementing such protocols often requires custom instrumentation, either modified commercial systems or fully bespoke setups, which poses a barrier for researchers without expertise in optics, electronics, or software. To address this, we present a versatile macroscopic fluorescence imaging system capable of supporting a wide range of protocols, and provide detailed build instructions along with open-source software to enable replication with minimal prior experience. We demonstrate its broad utility through applications to plants, reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Super-resolving frequency measurement with mode-selective quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve spectral features narrower than their bandwidth. Here, we introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light-matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. For the task of estimating the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity as small as 1/20 of the linewidth with up to a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced resolution of frequency measurements, combined with the memory's capability of on-demand storage, retrieval and mode conversion, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental violation of a Bell-like inequality for causal order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics allows for coherent control over the order in which different processes take place on a target system, giving rise to a new feature known as indefinite causal order. Indefinite causal order provides a resource for quantum information processing, and can be in principle be detected by the violation of certain inequalities on the correlations between measurement outcomes observed in the laboratory, in a similar way as quantum nonlocality can be detected by the violation of Bell inequalities. Here we report the experimental violation of a Bell-like inequality for causal order using a photonic setup where the order of two optical processes is controlled by a single photon of a polarization-entangled photon pair. Our proof-of-principle demonstration overcomes major technical challenges, including the need of high-speed quantum operations in photonic time-bin encoding, nanosecond synchronization of active optical and electronic elements to meet the target required for spacelike separation, and active temperature stabilization of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to ensure statistically significant violations. These experimental advances enable a statistically significant violation of the causal inequality, and open up a path towards a device-independent certification of indefinite order of events with uncharacterized quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum interference in integrated lithium niobate nanophotonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics has emerged as one of the leading platforms for the implementation of real-world-applicable quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, enhanced sensing capabilities, as well as resolving previously intractable computational challenges. However, to harness the full potential of the photonics platform, several engineering feats need to be accomplished, among those is the quest for a scalable source of pure single photons. While single photon sources can be implemented in a variety of different ways, integrated lithium niobate stands out as a prime contender for a monolithic quantum photonics platform, given its second-order nonlinearity and proven classical scalability. Despite the extensive effort put into developing the platform, integrating suitable photon pair sources remains a hurdle limiting the scalability of quantum photonic systems in lithium niobate. We engineer three-wave-mixing in a nanophotonic lithium niobate device, integrating multiple near-perfect spectrally separable heralded single photon sources. By mixing photons generated via the developed sources, we show bosonic interference between indistinguishable photons, a crucial interaction for many photonic quantum computing protocols. This demonstration of the first proof-of-principle multi-source interference in integrated lithium niobate contributes to developing a truly scalable quantum photonics platform.</description>

      <title>Tunable lower critical fractal dimension for a non-equilibrium phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of spatial dimension and driving frequency in a non-equilibrium phase transition of a driven-dissipative interacting bosonic system. In this setting, spatial dimension is dictated by the shape of the external driving field. We consider both homogeneous driving configurations, which correspond to standard integer-dimensional systems, and fractal driving patterns, which give rise to a non-integer Hausdorff dimension for the spatial density. The onset of criticality is characterized by critical slowing down in the excited density dynamics as the system asymptotically approaches the steady state, signaling the closing of the Liouvillian frequency gap. We show that the lower critical dimension -- below which the non-equilibrium phase transition ceases to occur -- can be controlled continuously by the frequency detuning of the driving field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how recent protocols developed for the stabilization of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states can be used for the estimation of two-quadrature displacement sensing, with sensitivities approaching the multivariate quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Thanks to the stabilization, this sensor is backaction evading and can function continuously without reset, making it well suited for the detection of itinerant signals. Additionally, we provide numerical simulations showing that the protocol can unconditionally surpass the Gaussian limit of displacement sensing with prior information, even in the presence of realistic noise. Our work shows how reservoir engineering in bosonic systems can be leveraged for quantum metrology, with potential applications in force sensing, waveform estimation and quantum channel learning.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-induced coherence, exciton-induced transparency and Fano interference for hybrid plasmonic systems in strong coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing the transition to strong coupling regime for an ensemble of emitters resonantly coupled to a localized surface plasmon in a metal-dielectric structure. The response of a hybrid system to an external field is determined by two distinct mechanisms involving collective states of emitters interacting with the plasmon mode. First is the near-field coupling between the bright collective state and the plasmon mode which underpins energy exchange between the system components and gives rise to exciton-induced transparency minimum in scattering spectra in the weak coupling regime and to emergence of polaritonic bands as the system transitions to strong coupling regime. The second mechanism is the Fano interference between the plasmon dipole moment and plasmon-induced dipole moment of bright collective state as the hybrid system interacts with the radiation field. The latter mechanism is greatly facilitated by plasmon-induced coherence in a system with characteristic size below the diffraction limit as the individual emitters comprising the collective state are driven by same alternating plasmon near field and therefore all oscillate in phase. This cooperative effect leads to scaling of the Fano asymmetry parameter and of the Fano function amplitude with the ensemble size and therefore it strongly affects the shape of scattering spectra for large ensembles. Specifically, with increasing emitters numbers, the Fano interference leads to a spectral weight shift towards the lower energy polaritonic band.</description>

      <title>Spectrally indistinguishable intermodal-vectorial four-wave-mixing in birefringent few-mode fibers for spatial-polarization-frequency hybrid-entangled photon-pairs generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use a birefringent few-mode fiber to demonstrate an intermodal-vectorial four-wave mixing process that generates two pairs of spectrally overlapping signal-idler bands. Using phase-matching conditions, we show that the pairs of bands become spectrally indistinguishable when the group refractive indices of the signal and idler modes intersect at the pump wavelength. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed through experimental observations corroborated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we introduce the two-photon state associated with the overlapping bands, which exhibits hybrid entanglement in spatial-polarization-frequency degrees of freedom. We explain that its degree of entanglement can be manipulated by tailoring the spectral position of the overlapping pairs of bands with respect to the Raman band and varying the excitation ratio of the pump modes. This study introduces a scheme for a fiber-based source of photon pairs with spatial-polarization-frequency entanglement.</description>

Abstract: To find a suitable framework for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry \&amp; M.R. Dennis's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f configuration. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO. As the opening chapter in a trilogy, this work connects crystal optics, Fourier optics, and nonlinear optics, while integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental physics, advancing all six domains.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Exciton--Hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridized States in hBN-encapsulated Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Induced Oxidation for Enhanced Purity and Reproducibility of Quantum Emission in Monolayer 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a voltage-induced oxidation technique using conductive atomic force microscopy to enhance the single-photon purity and reproducibility of quantum emitters in monolayer tung-sten diselenide (WSe2). By applying a controlled electric field across a monolayer WSe2/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) on a silicon substrate, localized oxidation is induced around nanoindented emitter sites in the WSe2. This treatment selectively suppresses defect-bound exciton emissions while preserving emission from pristine regions within the indentations. Photoluminescence and second-order correlation measurements at 18 K demonstrate a substantial increase in single-photon purity when comparing emitters from untreated and voltage-treated regions. Emitters from untreated regions showed average values of g2(0) near or above the 0.5 threshold. In contrast, emitters from voltage-treated regions exhibited g2(0) values consistently below 0.14, with most falling near 0.05, demonstrating high-purity single-photon emission well below the g2(0) &lt; 0.5 threshold. This enhancement results from the oxidation-induced suppression of spurious luminescence from the area around the quantum emitter site that is spectrally degenerate with the single-photon wavelength. This approach offers nonvolatile, spatially selective control over the emitter environment without degrading the emission intensity, improving both purity and stability. It provides a scalable route for integrating high-quality quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials into photonic platforms. Integration with spectral tuning strategies such as strain engineering, local dielectric patterning, or electrostatic gating could further enable deterministic, wavelength-selective single-photon sources for advanced quantum photonic applications</description>

Abstract: We present PyMoosh, a Python-based simulation library designed to provide a comprehensive set of numerical tools allowing to compute essentially all optical characteristics of multilayered structures, ranging from reflectance and transmittance to guided modes and photovoltaic efficiency. PyMoosh is designed not just for research purposes, but also for use-cases in education. To this end, we have invested significant effort in ensuring user-friendliness and simplicity of the interface. PyMoosh has been developed in line with the principles of Open Science and taking into account the fact that multilayered structures are increasingly being used as a testing ground for optimization and deep learning approaches. We provide in this paper the theoretical basis at the core of PyMoosh, an overview of its capabilities, as well as a comparison between the different numerical methods implemented in terms of speed and stability. We are convinced such a versatile tool will be useful for the community in many ways.</description>

Abstract: Entangled two-mode Gaussian states constitute an important building block for continuous variable quantum computing and communication protocols and are thus of high demand for many experiments. In this work, we study such kind of states which are extracted from multimode light generated via type-II parametric down-conversion (PDC) in lossy waveguides. For such states, we demonstrate that the squeezing quantifies entanglement and we construct a measurement basis which results in the maximal bipartite entanglement. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the spatial master equation for PDC in a Markovian environment. The optimal measurement modes are compared with two widely-used broadband bases: the Mercer-Wolf basis (the first-order coherence basis) and the Williamson-Euler basis.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we describe the status of our experiment aimed at measuring the gravitationally induced phase shift on path-entangled photons. We use a kilometer-scale fiber interferometer whose arms are vertically displaced in the Earth gravitational potential, allowing photons propagating at different heights to accumulate different phases. To date, this is the first experiment to measure this effect on massless particles, thereby experimentally combining general relativity and quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We report a single-ion optical clock based on the 4S_1/2-3D_5/2 transition of the 40Ca+ ion, operated in a liquid nitrogen cryogenic environment,achieving a total systematic uncertainty of 4.6E-19. We employ a refined temperature evaluation scheme to reduce the frequency uncertainty due to blackbody radiation (BBR), and the 3D sideband cooling has been implemented to minimize the second-order Doppler shift. We have precisely determined the average Zeeman coefficient of the 40Ca+ clock transition to be 14.345(40) Hz/mT^2, thereby significantly reducing the quadratic Zeeman shift uncertainty. Moreover, the cryogenic environment enables the lowest reported heating rate due to ambient electric field noise in trapped-ion optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Quantized Neural Network</title>

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO) model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.</description>
