      <title>Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning VI. Enhancing neural network mitigation of stellar activity RV signals with additional metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of exoplanet masses using the radial velocity (RV) technique is currently limited by stellar activity, which introduces quasiperiodic variability signals that must be modeled and removed to enhance the sensitivity of the RV measurements to exoplanet signals. Neural networks have previously been demonstrated effective in modeling stellar activity signals in HARPS-N solar data using white light cross correlation functions (CCFs). Building on this work, we train a neural network on six years of HARPS-N solar data with additional parameters commonly associated to stellar activity, including chromatic CCFs, line shape metrics, spectral activity indicators, total solar irradiance (TSI) light curves from SORCE and TSIS-1, and TSI time derivatives. Our results show that parameters such as the bisector inverse slope and Na D equivalent widths do not significantly improve the neural network's ability to predict activity-induced RV variations compared to using the white light CCFs alone. However, parameters such as unsigned magnetic flux, the TSI and its time derivative, S-index, H-alpha equivalent width, chromatic CCFs, contrast, and full width at half maximum do improve the neural network's ability to predict RV scatter. Our new model reduces the RV scatter in a held-out test set from 147.1 cm/s to 93.3 cm/s, consistent with supergranulation noise levels reported in previous studies. These results suggest that finding effective tracers for (super)granulation will be critical to train models capable of further mitigating RV jitter, and necessary for characterizing Earth analogues.</description>

      <title>Possible stratospheric emission in the warm Neptune GJ 436 b from high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high spectral resolution $L$ band (2.91--3.85 $\mu$m) observations of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b from Keck II/KPIC. KPIC's single-mode fiber feed reduces the $L$ band sky background by a factor of 100, significantly improving sensitivity compared to a seeing-limited spectrometer and enabling a tentative ($\rm SNR = 3-4$) cross-correlation detection of GJ 436 b with a thermally inverted atmospheric model. In contrast with recent results from $JWST$ and high-resolution transmission spectroscopy, our retrieval analysis prefers the presence of H$_2$O, and possibly CH$_4$, molecular features in emission. The broad-band continuum flux associated with the maximum-likelihood model is substantially higher than expected based on both the $\sim670\rm\ K$ equilibrium temperature of GJ 436 b and previous results from low-resolution spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the loss of continuum information during the processing of high-resolution spectra makes our analysis effectively insensitive to the absolute continuum level of the planet, and that scaling the maximum-likelihood model to match the broad-band flux measured from low-resolution observations of GJ 436 b results in a detection of similar strength in cross-correlation. These results could be explained by a thermal inversion arising above a haze layer in the upper atmosphere of \gjb. Further observations, ideally post-eclipse in order to break the $K_p - \Delta v_{sys}$ degeneracy, are needed to clarify this possible detection. This work demonstrates the potential of $L$ band high-resolution spectroscopy for characterizing significantly smaller and cooler exoplanets compared with hot Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Methods for Initial Orbit Determination and Orbit Determination in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In orbital mechanics, Gauss's method for orbit determination (OD) is a popular, minimal assumption solution for obtaining the initial state estimate of a passing resident space object (RSO). Since much of the cislunar domain relies on three-body dynamics, a key assumption of Gauss's method is rendered incompatible, creating a need for a new, minimal assumption method for initial orbit determination (IOD). In this work, we present a framework for short and long term probabilistic target tracking in cislunar space which produces an initial state estimate with as few assumptions as possible. Specifically, we propose an IOD method involving the kinematic fitting of several series of noisy, consecutive ground-based observations. Once a probabilistic initial state estimate in the form of a particle cloud is formed, we apply the powerful Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) Filter to reduce the uncertainty of our state estimate over time. This combined IOD/OD framework is demonstrated for several classes of trajectories in cislunar space and compared to better-known filtering frameworks.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous magnetic coupling in exoplanets: the stop &amp; go of WASP-18 b's atmospheric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early studies of ionization in hot Jupiter atmospheres suggest that magnetic coupling can shape their dynamics. These effects may be most pronounced in ultra-hot Jupiters that sustain global magnetic fields. WASP-18 b hosts an ionized dayside atmosphere extending deep enough to be strongly influenced by magnetic forces. Phase curve observations suggest effective magnetic drag, yet its impact on the atmospheric circulation remains poorly constrained. This work explores how magnetic drag in an inhomogeneously ionized atmosphere shapes local and global dynamics to provide a pathway to constrain the planet's magnetic field strength. An analytical parameterization for anisotropic magnetic drag, including both Pedersen and Hall drag components, and associated frictional heating in the globally neutral atmosphere, is implemented in the 3D General Circulation Model ExoRad to study WASP-18 b's atmosphere. Climate characteristics are compared for different drag formulations to assess whether anisotropic physics is required to capture magnetic coupling effects. Anisotropic magnetic drag and frictional heating, both set by local ionization, strongly affect wind strength and direction in the upper atmosphere, modify the day-night circulation, and produce observable temperature asymmetries. They enhance the evening-morning terminator temperature difference near 0.1 bar and generate two off-equator hotspots with reduced eastward shift. The terminator regions are particularly sensitive to how magnetic drag is modeled. Anisotropic magnetic drag damps and redirects dayside-to-nightside winds, partially decoupling the equatorial flow at the morning terminator while maintaining the nightside jet. Locally varying drag forces and frictional heating create asymmetric temperature patterns manifesting as primary and secondary hotspot regions.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at the TNG: LXX. TOI-5734b: A hot sub-Neptune orbiting a relatively young K dwarf with an Earth-like density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing interest in young exoplanets is leading to a growing effort to understand the formation and evolutionary processes responsible for their different architectures. One interesting target is TOI-5734, a relatively young K3-K4 dwarf star ($500_{-150}^{+300}$ Myr) showing a transiting candidate in photometric observations followed up with high-resolution spectroscopic data. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) radial-velocity (RV) data, we aim to validate the presence of the companion TOI-5734b, measure its planetary mass, size, and its orbital parameters after having characterised its host star. We then aim to study its possible planetary composition and atmospheric evolution. By simultaneously modelling photometry and high-cadence RVs, we measured the radius, mass, and density of TOI-5734b precisely. In particular, we employed Gaussian processes (GPs) with a flexible kernel to discriminate between the stellar activity of the young host and planetary signals. We confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-5734b and measured its orbital period ($P_{\rm b}\sim6.18$ d), radius ($R_{\rm b} = 2.10^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$ $R_\oplus$), and mass ($M_{\rm b}=9.1^{+2.6}_{-2.6}$ $M_\oplus$). By measuring its density ($\rho_{\rm b}=0.98_{-0.30}^{+0.36}$ $\rho_\oplus$), we infer that TOI-5734b is close to having a rocky composition and an almost completely depleted primary envelope. Our results point toward the possibility of considering the target for atmospheric studies with present and future ground- and space-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Testing the Icy Pebble Accretion Hypothesis with Primordial Main Belt Asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large main-belt asteroids (diameter $D \gtrsim 120\ \mathrm{km}$) exhibit a surface composition gradient as a function of heliocentric distance, ranging from anhydrous bodies to those rich in hydrated and, possibly, ammoniated materials. Their primordial nature holds key clues to the evolution of the Solar System. It has been suggested that the volatile-rich bodies formed in the outer Solar System and were implanted into the main belt. Alternatively, volatiles may have been delivered via inward-drifting icy pebbles in the protosolar disk. Here, we examine whether in-situ formed rocky embryos can acquire volatiles through pebble accretion as the snowline migrated inward. With the turbulence strength of the disk, radial pebble flux, and the dimensionless stopping time of pebbles (St) as parameters, we calculate the growth of large asteroids. The results are then compared with mass and compositional constraints based on asteroid observations. We find that a moderate pebble flux ($\lesssim18~M_\oplus / \text{Myr}$) is required to enable volatile delivery while preventing the largest asteroids from becoming more massive than Ceres. Water accretion is feasible with $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 1$ mm). However, only the largest asteroids (D &gt; 200 km) can accumulate sufficient ammonia under such conditions. For most asteroids with D between 100 and 200 km, ammonia ice accretion requires $\mathrm{St} \sim 10^{-4}$ ($\sim 100\,\mu$m). Such small particle sizes may pose both theoretical and observational challenges. Thus, we propose that the intermediate-sized, potentially ammonia-bearing asteroids serve as a record of the Solar System's dynamic evolution.</description>

      <title>The Dispersed Matter Planet Project Sample -- Detection limits, Occurrence Rates and New Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DMPP is a radial-velocity survey that aims to detect planets around stars exhibiting anomalous activity signatures, consistent with the presence of close-in evaporating planets. Here, we report the discovery of 7 new planetary signals in 5 different systems: DMPP-2c &amp; d, HD67200/DMPP-6b &amp; c, HD118006/DMPP-7b, HD191122/DMPP-8b, and HD200133/DMPP-9b. We update the orbital parameters of the DMPP-1, DMPP-2, and DMPP-3 systems, along with those of the planetary systems orbiting HD181433, HD39194, and HD89839. We derive detection limits for all 24 targets in our sample with adequate observational coverage, and test the DMPP hypothesis by calculating the occurrence rates for planets in this configuration. We find that the occurrence rates of planets in our sample with orbital periods shorter than $50~\mathrm{d}$ and masses in the range $3$-$10$ M$_\oplus$ are $83.0^{+27.1}_{-24.4}\%$, for $10$-$30$ M$_\oplus$ are $27.0^{+15.0}_{-11.2}\%$, and for $30$-$100$ M$_\oplus$ are $13.9^{+11.8}_{-7.5}\%$. This is significantly higher than the occurrence rates reported by other radial velocity surveys, providing strong support for the DMPP hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Undetected past contacts with technological species: implications for technosignature science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), the highly incomplete sampling of the technosignature search space is often considered as a plausible explanation for the persistent lack of detections over six decades of searches. If correct, this would imply that technosignatures may already have reached Earth without being detected or correctly identified. Here, we explore this possibility using a Bayesian inference framework to estimate present-day detectability given $n\ge 1$ undetected contacts over the past 65 years -- the period since the first SETI experiment. We show that achieving high detectability of technosignatures emitted within a few hundred light-years of Earth would require implausibly large $n$ values, even exceeding the population of habitable planets within that range. More conservative estimates can be obtained only assuming that emitters are tightly clustered near Earth or that their population in the Milky Way has undergone a very recent and sudden boost. This tension is further exacerbated for short-lived technosignatures and persists whether they are omnidirectional, as in Dysonian megastructures, or directional, as in intentional communication attempts. These findings suggest that, if undetected past contacts from the Milky Way have indeed occurred, the best prospects of detection may lie in searches extending over several thousand light-years, though only a few detectable technoemissions would be expected.</description>

      <title>NIRPS tightens the mass estimate of GJ 3090 b and detects a planet near the stellar rotation period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated characterization of the planetary system orbiting the nearby M2 dwarf GJ 3090 (TOI-177; $d = 22$ pc), based on new high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations from NIRPS and HARPS. With an orbital period of 2.85 d, the transiting sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b has a mass we refine to $4.52 \pm 0.47 M_{\oplus}$, which, combined with our derived radius of $2.18 \pm 0.06 R_{\oplus}$, yields a density of $2.40^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The combined interior structure and atmospheric constraints indicate that GJ 3090 b is a compelling water-world candidate, with a volatile-rich envelope in which water likely represents a significant fraction. We also confirm the presence of a second planet, GJ 3090 c, a sub-Neptune with a 15.9 d orbit and a minimum mass of $10.0 \pm 1.3 M_{\oplus}$, which does not transit. Despite its proximity to the star's 18 d rotation period, our joint analysis using a multidimensional Gaussian process (GP) model that incorporates TESS photometry and differential stellar temperature measurements distinguishes this planetary signal from activity-induced variability. In addition, we place new constraints on a non-transiting planet candidate with a period of 12.7 d, suggested in earlier RV analyses. This candidate remains a compelling target for future monitoring. These results highlight the crucial role of multidimensional GP modelling in disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling the detection of a planet near the stellar rotation period that could have remained undetected with traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>
