      <title>Managing Learning Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple model of a designer who manages a learning structure. Agents have partial private information about a common-value good. The designer wishes to allocate the good to as many agents as possible without using monetary transfers. We formulate this environment as a mechanism design problem that nests social learning models and characterize an optimal mechanism under general distributions over private information. The optimal mechanism can be summarized by two parameters: one purely adjusts the allocation probability, while the other governs the amount of learning implicitly induced by allocation. Although the designer always prefers to allocate the good, managing incentives for learning leads the optimal mechanism to withhold allocation even when allocation is socially efficient. Our analysis brings the perspective of managing learning structures to market design and introduces a mechanism design approach to social learning.</description>

      <title>Optimal Budget Aggregation with Star-Shaped Preference Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of aggregating distributions, such as budget proposals, into a collective distribution. An ideal aggregation mechanism would be Pareto efficient, strategyproof, and fair. Most previous work assumes that agents evaluate budgets according to the $\ell_1$ distance to their ideal budget. We investigate and compare different models from the larger class of star-shaped utility functions - a multi-dimensional generalization of single-peaked preferences. For the case of two alternatives, we extend existing results by proving that under very general assumptions, the uniform phantom mechanism is the only strategyproof mechanism that satisfies proportionality - a minimal notion of fairness introduced by Freeman et al. (2021). Moving to the case of more than two alternatives, we establish sweeping impossibilities for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ disutilities: no mechanism satisfies efficiency, strategyproofness, and proportionality. We then propose a new kind of star-shaped utilities based on evaluating budgets by the ratios of shares between a given budget and an ideal budget. For these utilities, efficiency, strategyproofness, and fairness become compatible. In particular, we prove that the mechanism that maximizes the Nash product of individual utilities is characterized by group-strategyproofness and a core-based fairness condition.</description>

      <title>Undergraduate Course Allocation through Competitive Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prevailing methods of course allocation at undergraduate institutions involve reserving seats to give priority to designated groups of students. We introduce a competitive equilibrium-based mechanism that assigns course seats using student preferences and course priorities. This mechanism satisfies approximate notions of stability, efficiency, envy-freeness, and strategy-proofness. We evaluate its performance relative to a mechanism widely used in practice using preferences estimated from university data. Our empirical findings demonstrate an improvement in student satisfaction and allocation fairness. The number of students who envy another student of weakly lower priority declines by 8 percent, or roughly 500 students.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Mechanism Design: Jointly Eliciting Preferences and Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mechanism design in environments where agents have private preferences and private information about a common payoff-relevant state. In such settings with multi-dimensional types, standard mechanisms fail to implement efficient allocations. We address this limitation by proposing data-driven mechanisms that condition transfers on additional post-allocation information, modeled as an estimator of the payoff-relevant state. Our mechanisms extend the classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves framework. We show they achieve exact implementation in posterior equilibrium when the state is fully revealed or utilities are affine in an unbiased estimator. With a consistent estimator, they achieve approximate implementation that converges to exact implementation as the estimator converges, and we provide bounds on the convergence rate. We demonstrate applications to digital advertising auctions and AI shopping assistants, where user engagement naturally reveals relevant information, and to procurement auctions with consumer spot markets, where additional information arises from a pricing game played by the same agents.</description>
