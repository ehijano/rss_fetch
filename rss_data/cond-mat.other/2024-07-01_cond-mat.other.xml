      <title>Ultrafast high-temperature sintering of dense and textured alumina</title>

Abstract: Crystallographic texture engineering in ceramics is essential to achieve direction-specific properties. Current texture engineering methods are time-consuming, energy extensive, or can lead to unnecessary diffusion of added dopants. Herein, we explore ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) to prepare dense and textured alumina using templated grain growth (TGG). From a slurry containing alumina microplatelets coated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles dispersed in a matrix of alumina nanoparticles, green bodies with oriented microplatelets were prepared using magnetic assisted slip casting (MASC). The effects of the sintering temperature, time and heating rate on the density and microstructure of the obtained ceramics were then studied. We found that TGG occurs for a temperature range between 1640 and 1780 {\deg}C and 10 s sintering time. Sintering at 1700 {\deg}C for 10 s led to dense and textured alumina with anisotropic grains thanks to the Fe3O4 coating, which did not have the time to diffuse. The highest texture and relative density were obtained with a heating rate of ~5,500 {\deg}C/min, leading to texture-dependent anisotropic mechanical properties. This study opens new avenues for fabricating textured ceramics in ultra-short times.</description>

      <title>Polarization spontaneous and piezo: fundamentals and their implementation in ab initio calculations</title>

Abstract: Fundamental properties of spontaneous and piezo polarization are reformulated and critically reviewed. It was demonstrated that Landau definition of polarization as a dipole density could be used to the infinite systems. The difference between the bulk polarization and surface polarity are distinguished thus creating clear identification of both components. The local model of spontaneous polarization was created and used to calculate spontaneous polarization as the electric dipole density. It was shown that the proposed local model correctly predicts c-axis spontaneous polarization values of the nitride wurtzite semiconductors. It was also shown that the proposed model predicts zero polarization in the plane perpendicular to the c-axis, in accordance with symmetry requirements. In addition, the model results are in accordance with polarization equal to zero for zinc blende lattice. These data confirm the basic correctness of the proposed model. The spontaneous polarization values obtained for all wurtzite III nitrides (BN, AlN, GaN and InN) are in basic agreement with the earlier calculations using Berry phase and slab models of Bernardini et al. {Bernardini et al. Phys Rev B 56 (2001) R10024 &amp; 63 (2001) 193201} but not with Dreyer et al. {Dreyer et al. Phys. Rev X 6 (2016) 021038}. Wurtzite nitride superlattices ab initio calculations were performed to derive polarization-induced fields in the coherently strained lattices showing good agreement with the polarization values. The strained superlattice data were used to determine the piezoelectric parameters of wurtzite nitrides obtaining the values that were in basic agreement with the earlier data. Zinc blende superlattices were also modeled using ab initio calculations showing results that are in agreement with the absence of polarization of all nitrides in zinc blende symmetry.</description>

      <title>Extending non-adiabatic rate theory to strong electronic couplings in the Marcus inverted regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron transfer reactions play an essential role in many chemical and biological processes. Fermi's Golden rule, which assumes that the coupling between electronic states is small, has formed the foundation of electron transfer rate theory, however in short range electron/energy transfer reactions this coupling can become very large, and therefore Fermi's Golden Rule fails to make even qualitatively accurate rate predictions. In this paper I present a simple modified Golden Rule theory to describe electron transfer in the Marcus inverted regime at arbitrarily large electronic coupling strengths. The theory is based on an optimal global rotation of the diabatic states, which makes it compatible with existing methods for calculating Golden Rule rates that can account for nuclear quantum effects with anharmonic potentials. Furthermore the Optimal Golden Rule (OGR) theory can also combined with analytic theories for non-adiabatic rates, such as Marcus theory and Marcus-Levich-Jortner theory, offering clear physical insight into strong electronic coupling effects in non-adiabatic processes. OGR theory is also tested on a large set of spin-boson models and an anharmonic model against exact quantum dynamics calculations, where it performs well, correctly predicting rate turnover at large coupling strengths. Finally, an example application to a BODIPY-Anthracene photosensitizer reveals that strong coupling effects inhibit excited state charge recombination in this system, reducing the rate of this process by a factor of four. Overall OGR theory offers a new approach to calculating electron transfer rates at strong couplings, offering new physical insight into a range of non-adiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) is a model of quantum computation, which uses local measurements instead of unitary gates. Here we explain that the MBQC procedure has a fundamental basis in an underlying gauge theory. This perspective provides a theoretical foundation for global aspects of MBQC. The gauge transformations reflect the freedom of formulating the same MBQC computation in different local reference frames. The main identifications between MBQC and gauge theory concepts are: (i) the computational output of MBQC is a holonomy of the gauge field, (ii) the adaptation of measurement basis that remedies the inherent randomness of quantum measurements is effected by gauge transformations. The gauge theory of MBQC also plays a role in characterizing the entanglement structure of symmetry-protected topologically (SPT) ordered states, which are resources for MBQC. Our framework situates MBQC in a broader context of condensed matter and high energy theory.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Approximation and Aharonov-Casher Bands in Twisted Homobilayer TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological flat moir\'e bands with nearly ideal quantum geometry have been identified in homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e superlattices, and are thought to be crucial for understanding the fractional Chern insulating states recently observed therein. Previous work proposed viewing the system using an adiabatic approximation that replaces the position-dependence of the layer spinor with a nonuniform periodic effective magnetic field. When the local zero-point kinetic energy of this magnetic field cancels identically against that of an effective Zeeman energy, a Bloch-band version of Aharonov-Casher zero-energy modes, which we refer to as Aharonov-Casher band, emerges leading to ideal quantum geometry. Here, we critically examine the validity of the adiabatic approximation and identify the parameter regimes under which Aharonov-Casher bands emerge. We show that the adiabatic approximation is accurate for a wide range of parameters including those realized in experiments. Furthermore, we show that while the cancellation leading to the emergence of Aharonov-Casher bands is generally not possible beyond the leading Fourier harmonic, the leading harmonic is the dominant term in the Fourier expansions of the zero-point kinetic energy and Zeeman energy. As a result, the leading harmonic expansion accurately captures the trend of the bandwidth and quantum geometry, though it may fail to quantitatively reproduce more detailed information about the bands such as the Berry curvature distribution.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of underdamped Brownian collisional engines: New insights and resonant phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have been proposed as alternatives for nonequilibrium nanoscale engines. However, most studies have focused on the simpler overdamped case, leaving the role of inertia much less explored. In this work, we introduce the idea of collisional engines to underdamped Brownian particles, where each stage is sequentially subjected to a distinct driving force. A careful comparison between the performance of underdamped and overdamped Brownian work-to-work engines has been undertaken. The results show that underdamped Brownian engines generally outperform their overdamped counterparts. A key difference is the presence of a resonant regime in underdamped engines, in which both efficiency and power output are enhanced across a broad set of parameters. Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting dynamics and driving protocols to achieve optimal engine performance.</description>
