      <title>On Noise Resiliency of Neuromorphic Inferential Communication in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing leveraging spiking neural network has emerged as a promising solution to tackle the security and reliability challenges with the conventional cyber-physical infrastructure of microgrids. Its event-driven paradigm facilitates promising prospect in resilient and energy-efficient coordination among power electronic converters. However, different from biological neurons that are focused in the literature, microgrids exhibit distinct architectures and features, implying potentially diverse adaptability in its capabilities to dismiss information transfer, which remains largely unrevealed. One of the biggest drawbacks in the information transfer theory is the impact of noise in the signaling accuracy. Hence, this article hereby explores the noise resiliency of neuromorphic inferential communication in microgrids through case studies and underlines potential challenges and solutions as extensions beyond the results, thus offering insights for its implementation in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Memory Technologies for Synaptic Crossbar Arrays- Part 2: Design Knobs and DNN Accuracy Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossbar memory arrays have been touted as the workhorse of in-memory computing (IMC)-based acceleration of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), but the associated hardware non-idealities limit their efficacy. To address this, cross-layer design solutions that reduce the impact of hardware non-idealities on DNN accuracy are needed. In Part 1 of this paper, we established the co-optimization strategies for various memory technologies and their crossbar arrays, and conducted a comparative technology evaluation in the context of IMC robustness. In this part, we analyze various design knobs such as array size and bit-slice (number of bits per device) and their impact on the performance of 8T SRAM, ferroelectric transistor (FeFET), Resistive RAM (ReRAM) and spin-orbit-torque magnetic RAM (SOT-MRAM) in the context of inference accuracy at 7nm technology node. Further, we study the effect of circuit design solutions such as Partial Wordline Activation (PWA) and custom ADC reference levels that reduce the hardware non-idealities and comparatively analyze the response of each technology to such accuracy enhancing techniques. Our results on ResNet-20 (with CIFAR-10) show that PWA increases accuracy by up to 32.56% while custom ADC reference levels yield up to 31.62% accuracy enhancement. We observe that compared to the other technologies, FeFET, by virtue of its small layout height and high distinguishability of its memory states, is best suited for large arrays. For higher bit-slices and a more complex dataset (ResNet-50 with Cifar-100) we found that ReRAM matches the performance of FeFET.</description>

      <title>Economic Struggles and Inflation: How Does that affect voting decision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic hardships significantly affect public perception and voting intentions in general elections. The primary focus of my study is to capture the degree of influence that individual economic hardships have on their voting. I utilize the ANES 2024 Pilot Study1 Survey dataset and introduce a novel composite Inflation Behavior Index (IBR) that captures individuals' cumulative economic and cost of living experience. To that effect, the primary objectives of the current study are threefold: first, to develop a composite economic behavior index from available data and variables to capture the overall economic experience of U.S. individuals due to ongoing inflation; second, to examine how this economic behavior impacts political engagement and voting behavior utilizing appropriate and fitting mathematical models; and finally which specific personal experiences and perceptions about economy and cost of living likely to revoke party loyalty in upcoming U.S. presidential election. My study finds that increased personal economic struggles (pocketbook voting) due to inflation make it more likely for individuals to express an intention to vote against the Incumbent even if the Incumbent is from their self-identified political party. Conversely, having a negative perception of the national economy (sociotropic voting) is less likely to revoke party loyalty in the upcoming General election. In simpler terms, voters are more likely to vote along party lines even if they perceive their party (the Incumbent) is not handling the economy and cost of living well.</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state of the art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, simulation-ready agents by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine a social context with a social dilemma, recording its answers, and using them for Q\&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model exhibited significant performance closer to that of its larger relative, and that their improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a \%46 improvement in aligning with the behavior of the larger model, with \%100 representing complete alignment. This suggests that our pipeline represents an efficient method to transmit some form of theory of mind to smaller models, creating improved and cheaply deployable algorithms in the process. Despite their simplicity and their associated shortcomings and limitations, our findings represent a stepping stone in the pursuit and training of specialized models for strategic and social decision making.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Map on Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of Big Data has been established as a solid field of studies in many areas such as healthcare, science, transport, education, government services, among others. Despite widely discussed, there is no agreed definition about the paradigm although there are many concepts proposed by the academy and industry. This work aims to provide an analytical view of the studies conducted and published regarding the Big Data paradigm. The approach used is the systematic map of the literature, combining bibliometric analysis and content analysis to depict the panorama of research works, identifying patterns, trends, and gaps. The results indicate that there is still a long way to go, both in research and in concepts, such as building and defining adequate infrastructures and standards, to meet future challenges and for the paradigm to become effective and bring the expected benefits.</description>

      <title>From Text to Insight: Leveraging Large Language Models for Performance Evaluation in Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to enhance objectivity in organizational task performance evaluations. Through comparative analyses across two studies, including various task performance outputs, we demonstrate that LLMs can serve as a reliable and even superior alternative to human raters in evaluating knowledge-based performance outputs, which are a key contribution of knowledge workers. Our results suggest that GPT ratings are comparable to human ratings but exhibit higher consistency and reliability. Additionally, combined multiple GPT ratings on the same performance output show strong correlations with aggregated human performance ratings, akin to the consensus principle observed in performance evaluation literature. However, we also find that LLMs are prone to contextual biases, such as the halo effect, mirroring human evaluative biases. Our research suggests that while LLMs are capable of extracting meaningful constructs from text-based data, their scope is currently limited to specific forms of performance evaluation. By highlighting both the potential and limitations of LLMs, our study contributes to the discourse on AI role in management studies and sets a foundation for future research to refine AI theoretical and practical applications in management.</description>

      <title>Artworks Reimagined: Exploring Human-AI Co-Creation through Body Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image generation using generative artificial intelligence is a popular activity. However, it is almost exclusively performed in the privacy of an individual's home via typing on a keyboard. In this article, we explore body prompting as input for image generation. Body prompting extends interaction with generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image generation with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this concept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to transform artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event with hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our results from a sample of visitors (N=79) show that body prompting was well-received and provides an engaging and fun experience. We identify three distinct patterns of embodied interaction with the generative AI and present insights into participants' experience of body prompting and AI co-creation. We provide valuable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive generative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and other public cultural spaces.</description>

      <title>ICGMM: CXL-enabled Memory Expansion with Intelligent Caching Using Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN) is a theoretical framework addressing significant challenges of health data sovereignty and AI utilization in healthcare caused by data fragmentation across providers and institutions. It establishes a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision as a prerequisite to a sovereign health network, then facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse medical data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR) as a prerequisite for health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, where health data remains with participants and only model parameter updates are shared; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution. This framework ensures that no entity can prevent or control access to training on health data offered by participants or determine financial benefits, as these processes operate on a public blockchain with an immutable record and without a third party. It supports effective AI training in healthcare, allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial healthcare algorithms. Patients receive rewards into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt-in to the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to funding decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage. It highlights the potential to transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>

      <title>Control-Flow Attestation: Concepts, Solutions, and Open Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control-flow attestation (CFA) unifies the worlds of control-flow integrity and platform attestation by measuring and reporting a target's run-time behaviour to a verifier. Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether its execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been explored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things devices, cloud platforms, and many others. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years, the area remains fragmented, addressing different adversarial behaviours, verification paradigms, and deployment challenges. In this paper, we present the first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and solutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers published between 2016-2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and pose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.</description>

      <title>EATFormer: Improving Vision Transformer Inspired by Evolutionary Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by biological evolution, this paper explains the rationality of Vision Transformer by analogy with the proven practical evolutionary algorithm (EA) and derives that both have consistent mathematical formulation. Then inspired by effective EA variants, we propose a novel pyramid EATFormer backbone that only contains the proposed EA-based transformer (EAT) block, which consists of three residual parts, i.e., Multi-scale region aggregation, global and local interaction, and feed-forward network modules, to model multi-scale, interactive, and individual information separately. Moreover, we design a task-related head docked with transformer backbone to complete final information fusion more flexibly and improve a modulated deformable MSA to dynamically model irregular locations. Massive quantitative and quantitative experiments on image classification, downstream tasks, and explanatory experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods. E.g., our Mobile (1.8 M), Tiny (6.1 M), Small (24.3 M), and Base (49.0 M) models achieve 69.4, 78.4, 83.1, and 83.9 Top-1 only trained on ImageNet-1K with naive training recipe; EATFormer-Tiny/Small/Base armed Mask-R-CNN obtain 45.4/47.4/49.0 box AP and 41.4/42.9/44.2 mask AP on COCO detection, surpassing contemporary MPViT-T, Swin-T, and Swin-S by 0.6/1.4/0.5 box AP and 0.4/1.3/0.9 mask AP separately with less FLOPs; Our EATFormer-Small/Base achieve 47.3/49.3 mIoU on ADE20K by Upernet that exceeds Swin-T/S by 2.8/1.7.

      <title>Multi-controlled Phase Gate Synthesis with ZX-calculus applied to Neutral Atom Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis describes the process of converting arbitrary unitary operations into a gate sequence of a fixed universal gate set, usually defined by the operations native to a given hardware platform. Most current synthesis algorithms are designed to synthesize towards a set of single qubit rotations and an additional entangling two qubit gate, such as CX, CZ, or the Molmer Sorensen gate. However, with the emergence of neutral atom based hardware and their native support for gates with more than two qubits, synthesis approaches tailored to these new gate sets become necessary. In this work, we present an approach to synthesize multi controlled phase gates using ZX calculus. By representing quantum circuits as graph like ZX diagrams, one can utilize the distinct graph structure of diagonal gates to identify multi controlled phase gates inherently present in some quantum circuits even if none were explicitly defined in the original circuit. We evaluate the approach on a wide range of benchmark circuits and compare them to the standard Qiskit synthesis regarding its circuit execution time for neutral atom based hardware with native support of multi controlled gates. Our results show possible advantages for current state of the art hardware and represent the first exact synthesis algorithm supporting arbitrary sized multi controlled phase gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework addressing data fragmentation and siloing challenges, enabling scalable AI through data sovereignty. It facilitates effective AI utilization within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this single identity is not robust enough to protect the whole system and the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively authenticated. Therefore, a multi-factor authentication service is utilized to help guarantee the account security by transmitting an extra factor to the user to use. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with the corresponding login credentials, and if the identifiers are neither transmitted through the network nor accessible to users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To achieve this, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, by which the identities for the username and the login password can be defined respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can also verify the identity of a user at the username and password forms simultaneously. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or any third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information.
