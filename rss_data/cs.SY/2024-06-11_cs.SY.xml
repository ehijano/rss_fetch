      <title>Statistical AoI, Delay, and Error-Rate Bounded QoS Provisioning for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive ultra-reliable and low latency communications (mURLLC) has emerged to support wireless time/error-sensitive services, which has attracted significant research attention while imposing several unprecedented challenges not encountered before. By leveraging the significant improvements in space-aerial-terrestrial resources for comprehensive 3D coverage, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks have been proposed to achieve rigorous and diverse quality-of-services (QoS) constraints of mURLLC. To effectively measure data freshness in satellite communications, recently, age of information (AoI) has surfaced as a novel QoS criterion for ensuring time-critical applications. Nevertheless, because of the complicated and dynamic nature of network environments, how to efficiently model multi-dimensional statistical QoS provisioning while upper-bounding peak AoI, delay, and error-rate for diverse network segments is still largely open. To address these issues, in this paper we propose statistical QoS provisioning schemes over satellite-terrestrial integrated networks in the finite blocklength regime. In particular, first we establish a satellite-terrestrial integrated wireless network architecture model and an AoI metric model. Second, we derive a series of fundamental statistical QoS metrics including peak-AoI bounded QoS exponent, delay-bounded QoS exponent, and error-rate bounded QoS exponent. Finally, we conduct a set of simulations to validate and evaluate our proposed statistical QoS provisioning schemes over satellite-terrestrial integrated networks.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Finite-Horizon Social Optimal Control of Mean-Field Coupled Linear-Quadratic Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and solve an optimal control problem with cooperative, mean-field coupled linear-quadratic subsystems and additional risk-aware costs depending on the covariance and skew of the disturbance. This problem quantifies the variability of the subsystem state energy rather than merely its expectation. In contrast to related work, we develop an alternative approach that illuminates a family of matrices with many analytical properties, which are useful for effectively extracting the mean-field coupled solution from a standard LQR solution.</description>

      <title>Active Islanding Detection Using Pulse Compression Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An islanding detection scheme is developed using pulse compression probing (PCP). A state space system realization is taken from the probing output. The nu-gap metric is applied to compare the measured system to fully intact system and classify it as islanded, or grid-connected. The designed detector displays fast operation, accurate islanding detection results under varying grid condition, and is physically implementable at the terminals of an inverter. The method is verified via electro-magnetic transient (EMT) simulation on a modified IEEE 34 bus test system with randomized loads and simultaneous probing at three independent solar plants, with the probing signal directly implemented into the logic of a switching inverter model.</description>

      <title>Compensation for reactive power and harmonic current drawn by a non-linear load in a pv-micro hydro grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simulation approach to enhance the power quality of a PV-micro hydro grid supplying both linear consumer load and non-linear industrial load by integrating Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF), utilizing instantaneous PQ theory and hysteresis current control band logic. The non-linear load draws reactive power and harmonic current from the source thereby affecting the power quality. The integration of the SAPF at the point of common coupling (PCC) offers reactive power and harmonic current compensation, ensuring that the current supply to the grid remains nearly sinusoidal and proportional to the active power. By injecting equal and opposite harmonic components, the SAPF effectively reduces Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) from 7% to 2.96%, thereby enhancing the overall power quality of the PV-micro hydro grid system.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Monotonicity to Design an Adaptive PI Passivity-Based Controller for a Fuel-Cell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a controller for a power electronic system composed of a fuel cell (FC) connected to a boost converter which feeds a resistive load. The controller aims to regulate the output voltage of the converter regardless of the uncertainty of the load. Leveraging the monotonicity feature of the fuel cell polarization curve we prove that the nonlinear system can be controlled by means of a passivity-based proportional-integral approach. We afterward extend the result to an adaptive version, allowing the controller to deal with parameter uncertainties, such as inductor parasitic resistance, load, and FC polarization curve parameters. This adaptive design is based on an indirect control approach with online parameter identification performed by a ``hybrid'' estimator which combines two techniques: the gradient-descent and immersion-and-invariance algorithms. The overall system is proved to be stable with the output voltage regulated to its reference. Experimental results validate our proposal under two real-life scenarios: pulsating load and output voltage reference changes.</description>

      <title>Practical Explicit-time Stabilization of a Proportional Control System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proportional control can be realized directly through the amplification of analog signals, and it also has the advantage of easy tuning parameters in digital signal control. However, it is difficult for the proportional control to preset the upper bound of settling time. To address this problem, a novel practical explicit-time control method is proposed. In bounded initial condition, this method makes this system error converge to a predefined neighborhood of zero within an explicit time. More specifically, the initial condition set and conditionally stable set are solved by practical explicit-time stabilization theorem. Based on that, a proportional feedback control is founded to achieve practical conditional fixed-time stability.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Identification of Linear Regression Models with Residual-Permuted Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies a distribution-free, finite-sample data perturbation (DP) method, the Residual-Permuted Sums (RPS), which is an alternative of the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) algorithm, to construct confidence regions. While SPS assumes independent (but potentially time-varying) noise terms which are symmetric about zero, RPS gets rid of the symmetricity assumption, but assumes i.i.d. noises. The main idea is that RPS permutes the residuals instead of perturbing their signs. This letter introduces RPS in a flexible way, which allows various design-choices. RPS has exact finite sample coverage probabilities and we provide the first proof that these permutation-based confidence regions are uniformly strongly consistent under general assumptions. This means that the RPS regions almost surely shrink around the true parameters as the sample size increases. The ellipsoidal outer-approximation (EOA) of SPS is also extended to RPS, and the effectiveness of RPS is validated by numerical experiments, as well.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Pointing Error Model for FSO Links with Fixed-Wing UAVs for 6G: Analysis and Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) communication is a promising solution to support wireless backhaul links in emerging 6G non-terrestrial networks. At the link level, pointing errors in FSO links can significantly impact capacity, making accurate modeling of these errors essential for both assessing and enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for FSO pointing errors in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that incorporates three-dimensional (3D) jitter, including roll, pitch, and yaw angle jittering. We derive a probability density function for the pointing error angle based on the relative position and posture of the UAV to the ground station. This model is then integrated into a trajectory optimization problem designed to maximize energy efficiency while meeting constraints on speed, acceleration, and elevation angle. Our proposed optimization method significantly improves energy efficiency by adjusting the UAV's flight trajectory to minimize exposure to directions highly affected by jitter. The simulation results emphasize the importance of using UAV-specific 3D jitter models in achieving accurate performance measurements and effective system optimization in FSO communication networks. Utilizing our generalized model, the optimized trajectories achieve up to 11.8 percent higher energy efficiency compared to those derived from conventional Gaussian pointing error models.</description>

      <title>The Development of the Reproductive Healthcare Equity Algorithm (RHEA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the repeal of Roe vs. Wade in June 2022, women face long-distance travel across state lines to access abortion care. For women who also face socioeconomic hardship, travel for abortion care is a significant burden. To ease this burden, abortion access nonprofits are funding and/or supplying transportation to abortion clinics. However, due to the uneven distribution of demand and supply for abortions, these nonprofits do not have efficient logistical operations. As a result, low-income, underserved women may not have access to adequate reproductive healthcare, thus widening healthcare inequity gaps. Nonprofits may also risk not serving the needs of vulnerable women without access to adequate reproductive healthcare, and in doing so, waste resources, money, and volunteer hours. To address these challenges, we create an interactive, web-based planning tool, the Reproductive Healthcare Equity Algorithm (RHEA), to guide nonprofits in strategically allocating resources and serving demand. RHEA leverages an optimization model to determine the maximum flow and minimum transportation cost to route women across a network of counties and abortion clinics, subject to transportation supply, budget, and time constraints for one day of operations for a nonprofit. In doing so, we collaborate with abortion access nonprofits to cater our model design and interface development to their needs and considerations. Ultimately, we seek to optimize resource allocation for nonprofits providing abortion care logistics and improve abortion access for low-income, underserved women.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Output Tracking Control with Reference Model System Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops adaptive output tracking control schemes with the reference output signal generated from an unknown reference system whose output derivatives are also unknown. To deal with such reference system uncertainties, an expanded adaptive controller structure is developed to include a parametrized estimator of the equivalent reference input signal. Without using the knowledge of the reference system transfer function and equivalent input, both are the critical components of a traditional model reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme, the developed new MRAC schemes designed for various cases plant and reference model uncertainties, ensure completely parametrized error systems and stable parameter adaptation, leading to the desired closed-loop system stability and asymptotic output tracking.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Flight Envelope Protection: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a flight envelope protection algorithm on a longitudinal axis that leverages reinforcement learning (RL). By considering limits on variables such as angle of attack, load factor, and pitch rate, the algorithm counteracts excessive pilot or control commands with restoring actions. Unlike traditional methods requiring manual tuning, RL facilitates the approximation of complex functions within the trained model, streamlining the design process. This study demonstrates the promising results of RL in enhancing flight envelope protection, offering a novel and easy-to-scale method for safety-ensured flight.</description>

      <title>Statistical Delay and Error-Rate Bounded QoS Provisioning for AoI-Driven 6G Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks Using FBC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the pivotal enablers for 6G, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks have emerged as a solution to provide extensive connectivity and comprehensive 3D coverage across the spatial-aerial-terrestrial domains to cater to the specific requirements of 6G massive ultra-reliable and low latency communications (mURLLC) applications, while upholding a diverse set of stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In the context of mURLLC satellite services, the concept of data freshness assumes paramount significance, as the use of outdated data may lead to unforeseeable or even catastrophic consequences. To effectively gauge the degree of data freshness for satellite-terrestrial integrated communications, the notion of age of information (AoI) has recently emerged as a novel dimension of QoS metrics to support time-sensitive applications. Nonetheless, the research efforts directed towards defining novel diverse statistical QoS provisioning metrics, including AoI, delay, and reliability, while accommodating the dynamic and intricate nature of satellite-terrestrial integrated environments, are still in their infancy. To overcome these problems, in this paper we develop analytical modeling formulations/frameworks for statistical QoS over 6G satellite-terrestrial integrated networks using hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) in the finite blocklength regime. In particular, first we design the satellite-terrestrial integrated wireless network architecture model and AoI metric model. Second, we characterize the peak-AoI bounded QoS metric using HARQ-IR protocol. Third, we develop a set of new fundamental statistical QoS metrics in the finite blocklength regime. Finally, extensive simulations have been conducted to assess and analyze the efficacy of statistical QoS schemes for satellite-terrestrial integrated networks.</description>

      <title>Economic and Environmental Sustainability Through Reshoring: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not too long ago, offshoring was considered a panacea for many U.S. companies to achieve economic sustainability. Offshoring also created an unnecessary movement of goods between the point of consumption and the point of sourcing and hence contributed to greenhouse gas emissions. With many things changed, hundreds of U.S. companies have started Reshoring. Due to supply chain disruptions and increased tax implications, including tariffs, there is a growing desire among companies to achieve economic and environmental sustainability through reshoring. This model case study highlighted the common offshoring challenges and demonstrated new methods/solutions for the companies to save their bottom line. Using the Reshorability Index (RI) and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) we developed a model to show which products or components we should bring back to the U.S. instead of continuing offshoring. From this study, we have found out that reshoring is not only an economically profitable decision but also has a positive impact on reducing GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. Our research found that the companies that currently offshore heavy products will benefit more from implementing our developed model. Leveraging this model, industries can identify, and compare the ownership cost of their purchased materials and take the decision on potential reshoring. Additionally, companies will be able to calculate the GHG emission and identify the reduction of such emissions due to reshoring.</description>

      <title>Approximating arrival costs in distributed moving horizon estimation: A recursive method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach to distributed moving horizon estimation for constrained nonlinear processes. The method involves approximating the arrival costs of local estimators through a recursive framework. First, distributed full-information estimation for linear unconstrained systems is presented, which serves as the foundation for deriving the analytical expression of the arrival costs for the local estimators. Subsequently, we develop a recursive arrival cost design for linear distributed moving horizon estimation. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the stability of the estimation error for constrained linear systems. Next, we extend the arrival cost design derived for linear systems to account for nonlinear systems, and a partition-based constrained distributed moving horizon estimation algorithm for nonlinear systems is formulated. A benchmark chemical process is used to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Virtual Power Plants With Frequency Regulation Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integrating heterogeneous distributed energy resources to provide fast frequency regulation, this paper proposes a dynamic virtual power plant~(DVPP) with frequency regulation capacity. A parameter anonymity-based approach is established for DVPP aggregating small-scaled inverter-based resources~(IBRs) with privacy concerns. On this basis, a parameter-to-performance mapping is formulated to evaluate how control coefficients impact the DVPP-level power overshoot as well as the IBR-level costs. The objective is to design the best way to provide the frequency response with minimal impacts on grid and the most financial gains. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and further analysis validates that our models are able to take dead bands into consideration.</description>

      <title>Economic Model Predictive Control of Water Distribution Systems with Accelerated Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has emerged as an effective strategy for water distribution systems (WDSs) management. However, it is hampered by the computational burden for large-scale WDSs due to the combinatorial growth of possible control actions that must be evaluated at each time step. Therefore, a fast computation algorithm to implement MPC in WDSs can be obtained using a move-blocking approach that simplifies control decisions while ensuring solution feasibility. This paper introduces a least-restrictive move-blocking that interpolates the blocked control rate of change, aiming at balancing computational efficiency with operational effectiveness. The proposed control strategy is demonstrated on aggregated WDSs, encompassing multiple hydraulic elements. This implementation is incorporated into a multi-objective optimization framework that concurrently optimizes water level security of the storage tanks, smoothness of the control actions, and cost-effective objectives. A fair comparison between the proposed approach with the non-blocking Economic MPC is provided.</description>

      <title>Model Updating for Nonlinear Systems with Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the predictive capacity of system models in the input-output sense, this paper presents a framework for model updating via learning of modeling uncertainties in locally (and thus also in globally) Lipschitz nonlinear systems. First, we introduce a method to extend an existing known model with an uncertainty model so that stability of the extended model is guaranteed in the sense of set invariance and input-to-state stability. To achieve this, we provide two tractable semi-definite programs. These programs allow obtaining optimal uncertainty model parameters for both locally and globally Lipschitz nonlinear models, given uncertainty and state trajectories. Subsequently, in order to extract this data from the available input-output trajectories, we introduce a filter that incorporates an approximated internal model of the uncertainty and asymptotically estimates uncertainty and state realizations. This filter is also synthesized using semi-definite programs with guaranteed robustness with respect to uncertainty model mismatches, disturbances, and noise. Numerical simulations for a large data-set of a roll plane model of a vehicle illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methodology in improving model accuracy, while guaranteeing stability.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Machine-Learning-Based Online Battery State of Health Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key function of battery management systems (BMS) in e-mobility applications is estimating the battery state of health (SoH) with high accuracy. This is typically achieved in commercial BMS using model-based methods. There has been considerable research in developing data-driven methods for improving the accuracy of SoH estimation. The data-driven methods are diverse and use different machine-learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques. Complex AI/ML techniques are difficult to implement in low-cost microcontrollers used in BMS due to the extensive use of non-linear functions and large matrix operations. This paper proposes a computationally efficient and data-lightweight SoH estimation technique. Online impedance at four discrete frequencies is evaluated to derive the features of a linear regression problem. The proposed solution avoids complex mathematical operations and it is well-suited for online implementation in a commercial BMS. The accuracy of this method is validated on two experimental datasets and is shown to have a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 2% across diverse training and testing data.</description>

      <title>Model predictive control for tracking using artificial references: Fundamentals, recent results and practical implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive tutorial on a family of Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulations, known as MPC for tracking, which are characterized by including an artificial reference as part of the decision variables in the optimization problem. These formulations have several benefits with respect to the classical MPC formulations, including guaranteed recursive feasibility under online reference changes, as well as asymptotic stability and an increased domain of attraction. This tutorial paper introduces the concept of using an artificial reference in MPC, presenting the benefits and theoretical guarantees obtained by its use. We then provide a survey of the main advances and extensions of the original linear MPC for tracking, including its non-linear extension. Additionally, we discuss its application to learning-based MPC, and discuss optimization aspects related to its implementation.</description>

      <title>A Lora-Based and Maintenance-Free Cattle Monitoring System for Alpine Pastures and Remote Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) is boosting the proliferation of sensors and smart devices in industry and daily life. Continuous monitoring IoT systems are also finding applications in agriculture, particularly in the realm of smart farming. The adoption of wearable sensors to record the activity of livestock has garnered increasing interest. Such a device enables farmers to locate, monitor, and constantly assess the health status of their cattle more efficiently and effectively, even in challenging terrain and remote locations. This work presents a maintenance-free and robust smart sensing system that is capable of tracking cattle in remote locations and collecting activity parameters, such as the individual's grazing- and resting time. To support the paradigm of smart farming, the cattle tracker is capable of monitoring the cow's activity by analyzing data from an accelerometer, magnetometer, temperature sensor, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) module, providing them over Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) to a backend server. By consuming 511.9 J per day with all subsystems enabled and a data transmission every 15 minutes, the custom-designed sensor node achieves a battery lifetime of 4 months. When exploiting the integrated solar energy harvesting subsystem, this can be even increased by 40% to up to 6 months. The final sensing system's robust operation is proven in a trial run with two cows on a pasture for over three days. Evaluations of the experimental results clearly show behavior patterns, which confirms the practicability of the proposed solution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Precision-Timed Virtual Machine (PretVM), an intermediate platform facilitating the execution of quasi-static schedules compiled from a subset of programs written in the Lingua Franca (LF) coordination language. The subset consists of those programs that in principle should have statically verifiable and predictable timing behavior. The PretVM provides a schedule with well-defined worst-case timing bounds. The PretVM provides a clean separation between application logic and coordination logic, yielding more analyzable program executions. Experiments compare the PretVM against the default (more dynamic) LF scheduler and show that it delivers time-accurate deterministic execution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As interactions with autonomous agents-ranging from robots in physical settings to avatars in virtual and augmented realities-become more prevalent, developing advanced cognitive architectures is critical for enhancing the dynamics of human-avatar groups. This paper presents a reinforcement-learning-based cognitive architecture, trained via a sim-to-real approach, designed to improve synchronization in periodic motor tasks, crucial for applications in group rehabilitation and sports training. Extensive numerical validation consistently demonstrates improvements in synchronization. Theoretical derivations and numerical investigations are complemented by preliminary experiments with real participants, showing that our avatars can integrate seamlessly into human groups, often being indistinguishable from humans.</description>

      <title>A LoRa-based Energy-efficient Sensing System for Urban Data Collection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, cities provide much more than shopping opportunities or working spaces. Individual locations such as parks and squares are used as meeting points and local recreation areas by many people. To ensure that they remain attractive in the future, the design of such squares must be regularly adapted to the needs of the public. These utilization trends can be derived using public data collection. The more diverse and rich the data sets are, the easier it is to optimize public space design through data analysis. Traditional data collection methods such as questionnaires, observations, or videos are either labor intensive or cannot guarantee to preserve the individual's privacy. This work presents a privacy-preserving, low-power, and low-cost smart sensing system that is capable of anonymously collecting data about public space utilization by analyzing the occupancy distribution of public seating. To support future urban planning the sensor nodes are capable of monitoring environmental noise, chair utilization, and their position, temperature, and humidity and provide them over a city-wide Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). The final sensing system's robust operation is proven in a trial run at two public squares in a city with 16 sensor nodes over a duration of two months. By consuming 33.65 mWh per day with all subsystems enabled, including sitting detection based on a continuous acceleration measurement operating on a robust and simple threshold algorithm, the custom-designed sensor node achieves continuous monitoring during the 2-month trial run. The evaluation of the experimental results clearly shows how the two locations are used, which confirms the practicability of the proposed solution. All data collected during the field trial is publicly available as open data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security, defined as protection against external threats, is a critical concern for homes and offices. Intrusion, characterized by unauthorized access, presents a significant challenge to maintaining security. This research aims to address this issue by designing and implementing an automated intrusion detection system utilizing a combination of sensors and communication technologies.
  The research introduced an automated intrusion detection system for homes and offices, combining sensors such as a PIR sensor for detecting unauthorized motion, magnetic switches for unauthorized entry detection, and a GSM module for notifying property owners. Employing the ATmega328P microcontroller, sensor data is analysed to generate early intrusion alerts, prompting phone call notifications via the GSM module. Practical implementation involved breadboarding, soldering, and rigorous testing, ensuring proper functionality under real-world conditions. The implemented intrusion detection system effectively utilizes magnetic switches and a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to detect unauthorized entry and motion within the premises, respectively. Upon detection, the system promptly analyses the situation and alerts the property owner via phone call, enabling swift response measures. This real-time notification system enhances proactive security management, minimizing the risk of further intrusion and ensuring the safety of the property. The multi-sensor intrusion detection system, incorporating PIR sensors, magnetic switches, and a GSM-based phone call gateway, effectively alerts property owners of unauthorized intrusions in real-time. Demonstrating its efficacy through rigorous testing, the system offers enhanced security for both residential and commercial environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic importance learning using fisher information gain for nonlinear system identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) provides a way for quantifying the information content of an observable random variable concerning unknown parameters within a model that characterizes the variable. When parameters in a model are directly linked to individual features, the diagonal elements of the FIM can signify the relative importance of each feature. However, in scenarios where feature interactions may exist, a comprehensive exploration of the full FIM is necessary rather than focusing solely on its diagonal elements. This paper presents an end-to-end black box system identification approach that integrates the FIM into the training process to gain insights into dynamic importance and overall model structure. A decision module is added to the first layer of the network to determine the relevance scores using the entire FIM as input. The forward propagation is then performed on element-wise multiplication of inputs and relevance scores. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively captures various types of interactions between dynamics, outperforming existing methods limited to polynomial interactions. Moreover, the effectiveness of this novel approach is confirmed through its application in identifying a real-world industrial system, specifically the PH neutralization process.</description>

      <title>A Novel Generative AI-Based Framework for Anomaly Detection in Multicast Messages in Smart Grid Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybersecurity breaches in digital substations can pose significant challenges to the stability and reliability of power system operations. To address these challenges, defense and mitigation techniques are required. Identifying and detecting anomalies in information and communication technology (ICT) is crucial to ensure secure device interactions within digital substations. This paper proposes a task-oriented dialogue (ToD) system for anomaly detection (AD) in datasets of multicast messages e.g., generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) and sampled value (SV) in digital substations using large language models (LLMs). This model has a lower potential error and better scalability and adaptability than a process that considers the cybersecurity guidelines recommended by humans, known as the human-in-the-loop (HITL) process. Also, this methodology significantly reduces the effort required when addressing new cyber threats or anomalies compared with machine learning (ML) techniques, since it leaves the models complexity and precision unaffected and offers a faster implementation. These findings present a comparative assessment, conducted utilizing standard and advanced performance evaluation metrics for the proposed AD framework and the HITL process. To generate and extract datasets of IEC 61850 communications, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed was employed.</description>

      <title>Optimal k-centers of a graph: a control-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a network consisting of n nodes, our goal is to identify the most central k nodes with respect to the proposed definitions of centrality. Depending on the specific application, there exist several metrics for quantifying k-centrality, and the subset of the best k nodes naturally varies based on the chosen metric. In this paper, we propose two metrics and establish connections to a well-studied metric from the literature (specifically for stochastic matrices). We prove these three notions match for path graphs. We then list a few more control-theoretic notions and compare these various notions for a general randomly generated graph. Our first metric involves maximizing the shift in the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. This shift can be interpreted as an improvement in the time constant when the RC circuit experiences leakage at certain k capacitors. The second metric focuses on minimizing the Perron root of a principal sub-matrix of a stochastic matrix, an idea proposed and interpreted in the literature as manufacturing consent. The third one explores minimizing the Perron root of a perturbed (now super-stochastic) matrix, which can be seen as minimizing the impact of added stubbornness. It is important to emphasize that we consider applications (for example, facility location) when the notions of central ports are such that the set of the best k ports does not necessarily contain the set of the best k-1 ports. We apply our k-port selection metric to various network structures. Notably, we prove the equivalence of three definitions for a path graph and extend the concept of central port linkage beyond Fiedler vectors to other eigenvectors associated with path graphs.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Hybrid Motion Planning Methods for Automated Driving Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning is an essential element of the modular architecture of autonomous vehicles, serving as a bridge between upstream perception modules and downstream low-level control signals. Traditional motion planners were initially designed for specific Automated Driving Functions (ADFs), yet the evolving landscape of highly automated driving systems (ADS) requires motion for a wide range of ADFs, including unforeseen ones. This need has motivated the development of the ``hybrid" approach in the literature, seeking to enhance motion planning performance by combining diverse techniques, such as data-driven (learning-based) and logic-driven (analytic) methodologies. Recent research endeavours have significantly contributed to the development of more efficient, accurate, and safe hybrid methods for Tactical Decision Making (TDM) and Trajectory Generation (TG), as well as integrating these algorithms into the motion planning module. Owing to the extensive variety and potential of hybrid methods, a timely and comprehensive review of the current literature is undertaken in this survey article. We classify the hybrid motion planners based on the types of components they incorporate, such as combinations of sampling-based with optimization-based/learning-based motion planners. The comparison of different classes is conducted by evaluating the addressed challenges and limitations, as well as assessing whether they focus on TG and/or TDM. We hope this approach will enable the researchers in this field to gain in-depth insights into the identification of current trends in hybrid motion planning and shed light on promising areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Uplink resource allocation optimization for user-centric cell-free MIMO networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimizing resource allocation in the uplink for a user-centric, cell-free, multi-input multi-output network. We start by modeling and developing resource allocation algorithms for two standard network operation modes. The centralized mode provides high data rates but suffers multiple issues, including scalability. On the other hand, the distributed mode has the opposite problem: relatively low rates, but is scalable. To address these challenges, we combine the strength of the two standard modes, creating a new semi-distributed operation mode. To avoid the need for information exchange between access points, we introduce a new quality of service metric to decentralize the resource allocation algorithms. Our results show that we can eliminate the need for information exchange with a relatively small penalty on data rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the two-player continuous-time infinite-horizon linear quadratic differential game problem, where one of the players can sample the state of the system only intermittently due to a sensing constraint while the other player can do so continuously. Under these asymmetric sensing limitations between the players, we analyze the optimal sensing and control strategies for the player at a disadvantage while the other player continues to play its security strategy. We derive an optimal sensor policy within the class of stationary randomized policies. Finally, using simulations, we show that the expected cost accrued by the first player approaches its security level as its sensing limitation is relaxed.</description>

      <title>Towards A General-Purpose Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose motion planners for automated/autonomous vehicles promise to handle the task of motion planning (including tactical decision-making and trajectory generation) for various automated driving functions (ADF) in a diverse range of operational design domains (ODDs). The challenges of designing a general-purpose motion planner arise from several factors: a) A plethora of scenarios with different semantic information in each driving scene should be addressed, b) a strong coupling between long-term decision-making and short-term trajectory generation shall be taken into account, c) the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle dynamics must be considered, and d) the motion planner must be computationally efficient to run in real-time. The existing methods in the literature are either limited to specific scenarios (logic-based) or are data-driven (learning-based) and therefore lack explainability, which is important for safety-critical automated driving systems (ADS). This paper proposes a novel general-purpose motion planning solution for ADS inspired by the theory of fluid mechanics. A computationally efficient technique, i.e., the lattice Boltzmann method, is then adopted to generate a spatiotemporal vector field, which in accordance with the nonholonomic dynamic model of the Ego vehicle is employed to generate feasible candidate trajectories. The trajectory optimising ride quality, efficiency and safety is finally selected to calculate the imminent control signals, i.e., throttle/brake and steering angle. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulations in highway driving, on-ramp merging, and intersection crossing scenarios, and it is found to outperform traditional motion planning solutions based on model predictive control (MPC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel compact and lossless quantum microgrid formation (qMGF) approach to achieve efficient operational optimization of the power system and improvement of resilience. This is achieved through lossless reformulation to ensure that the results are equivalent to those produced by the classical MGF by exploiting graph-theory-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that avoids the need for redundant encoding of continuous variables. Additionally, the qMGF approach utilizes a compact formulation that requires significantly fewer qubits compared to other quantum methods thereby enabling a high-accuracy and low-complexity deployment of qMGF on near-term quantum computers. Case studies on real quantum processing units (QPUs) empirically demonstrated that qMGF can achieve the same high accuracy as classic results with a significantly reduced number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models with Representation Editing: A Control Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human objectives is crucial for real-world applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs for alignment often suffers from unstable training and requires substantial computing resources. Test-time alignment techniques, such as prompting and guided decoding, do not modify the underlying model, and their performance remains dependent on the original model's capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose aligning LLMs through representation editing. The core of our method is to view a pre-trained autoregressive LLM as a discrete-time stochastic dynamical system. To achieve alignment for specific objectives, we introduce external control signals into the state space of this language dynamical system. We train a value function directly on the hidden states according to the Bellman equation, enabling gradient-based optimization to obtain the optimal control signals at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing test-time alignment techniques while requiring significantly fewer resources compared to fine-tuning methods.</description>

      <title>WoCoCo: Learning Whole-Body Humanoid Control with Sequential Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid activities involving sequential contacts are crucial for complex robotic interactions and operations in the real world and are traditionally solved by model-based motion planning, which is time-consuming and often relies on simplified dynamics models. Although model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for versatile and robust whole-body humanoid control, it still requires tedious task-specific tuning and state machine design and suffers from long-horizon exploration issues in tasks involving contact sequences. In this work, we propose WoCoCo (Whole-Body Control with Sequential Contacts), a unified framework to learn whole-body humanoid control with sequential contacts by naturally decomposing the tasks into separate contact stages. Such decomposition facilitates simple and general policy learning pipelines through task-agnostic reward and sim-to-real designs, requiring only one or two task-related terms to be specified for each task. We demonstrated that end-to-end RL-based controllers trained with WoCoCo enable four challenging whole-body humanoid tasks involving diverse contact sequences in the real world without any motion priors: 1) versatile parkour jumping, 2) box loco-manipulation, 3) dynamic clap-and-tap dancing, and 4) cliffside climbing. We further show that WoCoCo is a general framework beyond humanoid by applying it in 22-DoF dinosaur robot loco-manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Risk Sensitivity in Markov Games and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov games (MGs) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are studied to model decision making in multi-agent systems. Traditionally, the objective in MG and MARL has been risk-neutral, i.e., agents are assumed to optimize a performance metric such as expected return, without taking into account subjective or cognitive preferences of themselves or of other agents. However, ignoring such preferences leads to inaccurate models of decision making in many real-world scenarios in finance, operations research, and behavioral economics. Therefore, when these preferences are present, it is necessary to incorporate a suitable measure of risk into the optimization objective of agents, which opens the door to risk-sensitive MG and MARL. In this paper, we systemically review the literature on risk sensitivity in MG and MARL that has been growing in recent years alongside other areas of reinforcement learning and game theory. We define and mathematically describe different risk measures used in MG and MARL and individually for each measure, discuss articles that incorporate it. Finally, we identify recent trends in theoretical and applied works in the field and discuss possible directions of future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the unsourced random access scheme assuming that the base station is equipped with multiple antennas, and propose a high-performing solution utilizing on-off-division multiple access. We assume that each user spreads its pilot sequence and polar codeword to the pilot and data parts of the transmission frame, respectively, based on a transmission pattern. The iterative receiver operation consists of pilot and pattern detection followed by channel vector and symbol estimation, polar decoding, and successive interference cancellation. Numerical findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme has superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art in various antenna settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter explores the development and implementation of a novel thin film 1-by-4 reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designed for future communication and sensing scenarios. Utilizing cost-effective inkjet printing methods and additive manufacturing, our approach significantly simplifies the RIS construction process and reduces production costs. The RIS, fabricated on a flexible and lightweight polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate, integrates antennas, switching circuitry, and a microcontroller unit (MCU). This setup enables individual and simultaneous control of each RIS element, manipulating the captured carrier signal by steering its dominant harmonics toward multiple desired directions. Measurement results of the beam steering show the manufactured RIS has the potential to enable RIS-aided communication and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A quantitative investigation for deployment of mobile collaborative robots in high-value manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Component inspection is often the bottleneck in high-value manufacturing, driving industries like aerospace toward automated inspection technologies. Current systems often employ fixed arm robots, but they lack the flexibility in adapting to new components or orientations Advanced mobile robotic platforms with updated sensor technologies and algorithms have improved localization and path planning capabilities, making them ideal for bringing inspection processes directly to parts. However, mobile platforms introduce challenges in localization and maneuverability, leading to potential errors. Their positional uncertainty is higher than fixed systems due to the lack of a fixed calibrated location, posing challenges for position-sensitive inspection sensors. Therefore, it's essential to assess the positional accuracy and repeatability of mobile manipulator platforms. The KUKA KMR iiwa was chosen for its collaborative features, robust build, and scalability within the KUKA product range. The accuracy and repeatability of the mobile platform were evaluated through a series of tests to evaluate the performance of its integrated feature mapping, the effect of various speeds on positional accuracy, and the efficiency of the omnidirectional wheels for a range of translation orientations. Experimental evaluation revealed that enabling feature mapping substantially improves the KUKA KMR iiwa's performance, with accuracy gains and error reductions exceeding 90%. Repeatability errors were under 7 mm with mapping activated and around 2.5 mm in practical scenarios, demonstrating that mobile manipulators, incorporating both the manipulator and platform, can fulfil the precise requirements of industries with high precision needs. Providing a highly diverse alternative to traditional fixed-base industrial manipulators.</description>

      <title>Random Features Approximation for Control-Affine Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data-driven control applications call for flexible nonlinear models that are amenable to principled controller synthesis and realtime feedback. Many nonlinear dynamical systems of interest are control affine. We propose two novel classes of nonlinear feature representations which capture control affine structure while allowing for arbitrary complexity in the state dependence. Our methods make use of random features (RF) approximations, inheriting the expressiveness of kernel methods at a lower computational cost. We formalize the representational capabilities of our methods by showing their relationship to the Affine Dot Product (ADP) kernel proposed by Casta\~neda et al. (2021) and a novel Affine Dense (AD) kernel that we introduce. We further illustrate the utility by presenting a case study of data-driven optimization-based control using control certificate functions (CCF). Simulation experiments on a double pendulum empirically demonstrate the advantages of our methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic State-Space Identification of Closed-Loop Stochastic Linear Systems using Instrumental Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper suggests a generalization of the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) finite sample system identification method for the identification of closed-loop observable stochastic linear systems in state-space form. The solution builds on the theory of matrix-variate regression and instrumental variable methods to construct distribution-free confidence regions for the state-space matrices. Both direct and indirect identification are studied, and the exactness as well as the strong consistency of the construction are proved. Furthermore, a new, computationally efficient ellipsoidal outer-approximation algorithm for the confidence regions is proposed. The new construction results in a semidefinite optimization problem which has an order-of-magnitude smaller number of constraints, as if one applied the ellipsoidal outer-approximation after vectorization. The effectiveness of the approach is also demonstrated empirically via a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Sorta Solving the OPF by Not Solving the OPF: DAE Control Theory and the Price of Realtime Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to approximate the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF). By eliminating the need to solve the ACOPF every few minutes, the paper showcases how a realtime feedback controller can be utilized in lieu of ACOPF and its variants. By (i) forming the grid dynamics as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE) that naturally encode the non-convex OPF power flow constraints, (ii) utilizing DAELyapunov theory, and (iii) designing a feedback controller that captures realtime uncertainty while being uncertainty-unaware, the presented approach demonstrates promises of obtaining solutions that are close to the OPF ones without needing to solve the OPF. The proposed controller responds in realtime to deviations in renewables generation and loads, guaranteeing improvements in system transient stability, while always yielding approximate solutions of the ACOPF with no constraint violations. As the studied approach herein yields slightly more expensive realtime generator controls, the corresponding price of realtime control and regulation is examined. Cost comparisons with the traditional ACOPF are also showcased -- all via case studies on standard power networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Fault Estimators for Nonlinear Systems: An Ultra-Local Model Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear estimator for the robust reconstruction of process and sensor faults for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. The proposed fault estimation method augments the system dynamics with an ultra-local (in time) internal state-space representation (a finite chain of integrators) of the fault vector. Next, a nonlinear state observer is designed based on the known parts of the augmented dynamics. This nonlinear filter (observer) reconstructs the fault signal as well as the states of the augmented system. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee stability of the estimation error dynamics: firstly, asymptotic stability (i.e., exact fault estimation) in the absence of perturbations induced by the fault model mismatch (mismatch between internal ultra-local model for the fault and the actual fault dynamics), uncertainty, external disturbances, and measurement noise and, secondly, Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the estimation error dynamics is guaranteed in the presence of these perturbations. In addition, to support performance-based estimator design, we provide Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions for $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain and $\mathcal{L}_2-\mathcal{L}_\infty$ induced norm and cast the synthesis of the estimator gains as a semi-definite program where the effect of model mismatch and external disturbances on the fault estimation error is minimized in the sense of $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain, for an acceptable $\mathcal{L}_2-\mathcal{L}_\infty$ induced norm with respect to measurement noise. The latter result facilitates a design that explicitly addresses the performance trade-off between noise sensitivity and robustness against model mismatch and external disturbances. Finally, numerical results for a benchmark system illustrate the performance of the proposed methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces zonoLAB, a MATLAB-based toolbox for set-based control system analysis using the hybrid zonotope set representation. Hybrid zonotopes have proven to be an expressive set representation that can exactly represent the reachable sets of mixed-logical dynamical systems and tightly approximate the reachable sets of nonlinear dynamic systems. Moreover, hybrid zonotopes can exactly represent the continuous piecewise linear control laws associated with model predictive control and the input-output mappings of neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. The hybrid zonotope set representation is also highly exploitable, where efficient methods developed for mixed-integer linear programming can be directly used for set operation and analysis. The zonoLAB toolbox is designed to make these capabilities accessible to the dynamic systems and controls community, with functionality spanning fundamental operations with hybrid zonotope, constrained zonotope, and zonotope set representations, powerful set analysis tools, and general-purpose algorithms for reachability analysis of open- and closed-loop systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban transit bus idling is a contributor to ecological stress, economic inefficiency, and medically hazardous health outcomes due to emissions. The global accumulation of this frequent pattern of undesirable driving behavior is enormous. In order to measure its scale, we propose GRD-TRT- BUF-4I (Ground Truth Buffer for Idling) an extensible, realtime detection system that records the geolocation and idling duration of urban transit bus fleets internationally. Using live vehicle locations from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime, the system detects approximately 200,000 idling events per day from over 50 cities across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. This realtime data was created to dynamically serve operational decision-making and fleet management to reduce the frequency and duration of idling events as they occur, as well as to capture its accumulative effects. Civil and Transportation Engineers, Urban Planners, Epidemiologists, Policymakers, and other stakeholders might find this useful for emissions modeling, traffic management, route planning, and other urban sustainability efforts at a variety of geographic and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>Periodic Scenario Trees: A Novel Framework for Robust Periodic Invariance and Stabilization of Constrained Uncertain Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a new a framework for determining robust periodic invariant sets and their associated control laws for constrained uncertain linear systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizability by periodic controllers are stated and proven using finite step Lyapunov functions for the unconstrained case. We then introduce a scenario tree interpretation of finite step Lyapunov functions for uncertain systems and show that this interpretation results in useful criteria for the design of robust stabilizing controllers. In particular, novel convex feasibility criteria for the synthesis of simple static controllers and what we call linear interpolating tree periodic controllers with memory are derived. It is proven that for a sufficiently large length of the period, a stabilizing linear interpolating tree periodic controller can always be found using the proposed criterion provided that the uncertain system is stabilizable by such controllers. In this sense, the presented synthesis method is non-conservative. The results are then extended to constrained uncertain linear systems and conditions for controllers that realize robust periodic invariant sets which are less conservative than those that result from the known methods in the literature are derived.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Personalized Energy Consumption Range Estimation for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In urban traffic environments, driver behaviors exhibit considerable diversity in vehicle operation, encompassing a range of acceleration and braking maneuvers as well as adherence to traffic regulations, such as speed limits. It is well-established that these intrinsic driving behaviors significantly influence vehicle energy consumption. Therefore, establishing a quantitative relationship between driver behavior and energy usage is essential for identifying energy-efficient driving practices and optimizing routes within urban traffic. This study introduces a data-driven approach to predict the equivalent fuel consumption of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) based on an integrated model of driver behavior and vehicle energy consumption. Unlike traditional models that provide point predictions of fuel consumption, this approach uses Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) to offer prediction intervals that capture the variability and uncertainty in fuel consumption. These intervals reflect changes in fuel consumption, as well as variations in driver behavior, and vehicle and route conditions. To develop this model, driver-specific data were collected through a driver-in-the-loop simulator, which tested different human drivers responses. The CQR model was then trained and validated using the experimental data from the driver-in-the-loop simulator, augmented by the synthetic data generated from Monte Carlo simulations conducted using a calibrated microscopic driver behavior and vehicle energy model. The CQR model was evaluated by comparing its predictions of equivalent fuel consumption intervals with those of baseline prediction interval methods that rely solely on conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>ISAACS: Iterative Soft Adversarial Actor-Critic for Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of robots in uncontrolled environments requires them to operate robustly under previously unseen scenarios, like irregular terrain and wind conditions. Unfortunately, while rigorous safety frameworks from robust optimal control theory scale poorly to high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, control policies computed by more tractable "deep" methods lack guarantees and tend to exhibit little robustness to uncertain operating conditions. This work introduces a novel approach enabling scalable synthesis of robust safety-preserving controllers for robotic systems with general nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded modeling error by combining game-theoretic safety analysis with adversarial reinforcement learning in simulation. Following a soft actor-critic scheme, a safety-seeking fallback policy is co-trained with an adversarial "disturbance" agent that aims to invoke the worst-case realization of model error and training-to-deployment discrepancy allowed by the designer's uncertainty. While the learned control policy does not intrinsically guarantee safety, it is used to construct a real-time safety filter (or shield) with robust safety guarantees based on forward reachability rollouts. This shield can be used in conjunction with a safety-agnostic control policy, precluding any task-driven actions that could result in loss of safety. We evaluate our learning-based safety approach in a 5D race car simulator, compare the learned safety policy to the numerically obtained optimal solution, and empirically validate the robust safety guarantee of our proposed safety shield against worst-case model discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Velocity Obstacle for Polytopic Collision Avoidance for Distributed Multi-robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07954</link>

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance for multi-robot navigation with polytopic shapes is challenging. Existing works simplify the system dynamics or consider it as a convex or non-convex optimization problem with positive distance constraints between robots, which limits real-time performance and scalability. Additionally, generating collision-free behavior for polytopic-shaped robots is harder due to implicit and non-differentiable distance functions between polytopes. In this paper, we extend the concept of velocity obstacle (VO) principle for polytopic-shaped robots and propose a novel approach to construct the VO in the function of vertex coordinates and other robot's states. Compared with existing work about obstacle avoidance between polytopic-shaped robots, our approach is much more computationally efficient as the proposed approach for construction of VO between polytopes is optimization-free. Based on VO representation for polytopic shapes, we later propose a navigation approach for distributed multi-robot systems. We validate our proposed VO representation and navigation approach in multiple challenging scenarios including large-scale randomized tests, and our approach outperforms the state of art in many evaluation metrics, including completion rate, deadlock rate, and the average travel distance.</description>

      <title>Safely Learning Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in learning an unknown dynamical system is to reduce model uncertainty by making measurements while maintaining safety. We formulate a mathematical definition of what it means to safely learn a dynamical system by sequentially deciding where to initialize trajectories. The state of the system must stay within a safety region for a horizon of $T$ time steps under the action of all dynamical systems that (i) belong to a given initial uncertainty set, and (ii) are consistent with information gathered so far.
  First, we consider safely learning a linear dynamical system involving $n$ states. For the case $T=1$, we present an LP-based algorithm that either safely recovers the true dynamics from at most $n$ trajectories, or certifies that safe learning is impossible. For $T=2$, we give an SDP representation of the set of safe initial conditions and show that $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ trajectories generically suffice for safe learning. For $T = \infty$, we provide SDP-representable inner approximations of the set of safe initial conditions and show that one trajectory generically suffices for safe learning. We extend a number of our results to the cases where the initial uncertainty set contains sparse, low-rank, or permutation matrices, or when the system has a control input.
  Second, we consider safely learning a general class of nonlinear dynamical systems. For the case $T=1$, we give an SOCP-based representation of the set of safe initial conditions. For $T=\infty$, we provide semidefinite representable inner approximations to the set of safe initial conditions. We show how one can safely collect trajectories and fit a polynomial model of the nonlinear dynamics that is consistent with the initial uncertainty set and best agrees with the observations. We also present some extensions to cases where the measurements are noisy or the dynamical system involves disturbances.</description>

      <title>Taking Second-life Batteries from Exhausted to Empowered using Experiments, Data Analysis, and Health Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reuse of retired electric vehicle batteries in grid energy storage offers environmental and economic benefits. This study concentrates on health monitoring algorithms for retired batteries deployed in grid storage. Over 15 months of testing, we collect, analyze, and publicize a dataset of second-life batteries, implementing a cycling protocol simulating grid energy storage load profiles within a 3-4 V voltage window. Four machine-learning-based health estimation models, relying on online-accessible features and initial capacity, are compared, with the selected model achieving a mean absolute percentage error below 2.3% on test data. Additionally, an adaptive online health estimation algorithm is proposed by integrating a clustering-based method, thus limiting estimation errors during online deployment. These results showcase the feasibility of repurposing retired batteries for second-life applications. Based on obtained data and power demand, these second-life batteries exhibit potential for over a decade of grid energy storage use.</description>

      <title>MPC without Terminal Ingredients Tailored to the SEIR Compartmental Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the SEIR compartmental epidemic model subject to state and input constraints (a cap on the proportion of infectious individuals and limits on the allowed social distancing and quarantining measures, respectively). We present a tailored model predictive control (MPC) scheme without terminal conditions. We rigorously show recursive feasibility and asymptotic convergence of the MPC closed loop to the continuum of disease-free equilibrium points for suitably designed quadratic running cost and a sufficiently long prediction horizon (forecast window). Moreover, we establish the viability kernel (a.k.a. the admissible set) as a domain of attraction of the continuum of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Convergence Conditions of Online Regularized Statistical Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space With Non-Stationary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03211v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we study the mean square asymptotic stability of a class of random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences dependent on the homogeneous ones. Secondly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path, and show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying in some sense, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the regularization path in mean square. Furthermore, if the data streams also satisfy the RKHS persistence of excitation condition, i.e. there exists a fixed length of time period, such that the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every time period has a uniformly strictly positive compact lower bound in the sense of the operator order with respect to time, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the unknown function in mean square. Finally, for the case with independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency provided the marginal probability measures induced by the input data are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.</description>

      <title>Efficient Batch and Recursive Least Squares for Matrix Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, batch least squares (BLS) and recursive least squares (RLS) are used for identification of a vector of parameters that form a linear model. In some situations, however, it is of interest to identify parameters in a matrix structure. In this case, a common approach is to transform the problem into standard vector form using the vectorization (vec) operator and the Kronecker product, known as vec-permutation. However, the use of the Kronecker product introduces extraneous zero terms in the regressor, resulting in unnecessary additional computational and space requirements. This work derives matrix BLS and RLS formulations which, under mild assumptions, minimize the same cost as the vec-permutation approach. This new approach requires less computational complexity and space complexity than vec-permutation in both BLS and RLS identification. It is also shown that persistent excitation guarantees convergence to the true matrix parameters. This method can used to improve computation time in the online identification of multiple-input, multiple-output systems for indirect adaptive model predictive control.</description>

      <title>On-site scale factor linearity calibration of MEMS triaxial gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calibration of MEMS triaxial gyroscopes is crucial for achieving precise attitude estimation for various wearable health monitoring applications. However, gyroscope calibration poses greater challenges compared to accelerometers and magnetometers. This paper introduces an efficient method for calibrating MEMS triaxial gyroscopes via only a servo motor, making it well-suited for field environments. The core strategy of the method involves utilizing the fact that the dot product of the measured gravity and the rotational speed in a fixed frame remains constant. To eliminate the influence of rotating centrifugal force on the accelerometer, the accelerometer data is measured while stationary. The proposed calibration experiment scheme, which allows gyroscopic measurements when operating each axis at a specific rotation speed, making it easier to evaluate the linearity across a related speed range constituted by a series of rotation speeds. Moreover, solely the classical least squares algorithm proves adequate for estimating the scale factor, notably streamlining the analysis of the calibration process. Extensive numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the proposed method's performance in calibrating a triaxial gyroscope model. Experimental validation was also carried out using a commercially available MEMS inertial measurement unit (LSM9DS1 from Arduino nano 33 BLE SENSE) and a servo motor capable of controlling precise speed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed calibration approach.</description>

      <title>Path Planning and Motion Control for Accurate Positioning of Car-like Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the planning and control for accurate positioning of car-like robots. We propose a solution that integrates two modules: a motion planner, facilitated by the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm and continuous-curvature (CC) steering technique, generates a CC trajectory as a reference; and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) regulates the robot to accurately track the reference trajectory. Based on the $\mu$-tangency conditions in prior art, we derive explicit existence conditions and develop associated computation methods for a special class of CC paths which not only admit the same driving patterns as Reeds-Shepp paths but also consist of cusp-free clothoid turns. Afterwards, we create an autonomous vehicle parking scenario where the NMPC endeavors to follow the reference trajectory. Feasibility and computational efficiency of the CC steering are validated by numerical simulation. CarSim-Simulink joint simulations statistically verify that with exactly same NMPC, the closed-loop system with CC trajectories as references substantially outperforms the case where Reeds-Shepp trajectories are used as references.</description>
