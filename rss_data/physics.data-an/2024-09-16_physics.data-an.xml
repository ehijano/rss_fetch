      <title>Categorising current-voltage curves in single-molecule junctions and their comparison to Single-Level Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the mechanically controlled break junctions, with a particular emphasis on elucidating the behaviour of molecular currents at room temperature. The core of this experimental investigation involves a detailed analysis of conductance, examining how it varies over time and with changes in the gap between electrodes. Additionally, this study thoroughly evaluates transmission properties, coupling effects, and current characteristics. A pivotal aspect of the research was the meticulous current measurement, followed by carefully selecting optimal data sets. This process set the stage for an in-depth analysis of resonant tunnelling phenomena observed through a single channel. Notably, these experiments were conducted under open atmospheric conditions at room temperature. A significant finding from this study is the recognition that our current model requires refinement. This adjustment is necessary to encapsulate a broader spectrum of molecular transport mechanisms more accurately. Furthermore, this work significantly advances our comprehension of quantum effects in single-molecule junctions, particularly concerning similar molecules to Corannulene extending to some organometallics. One of the essential disclosures is the identification of deviations in the transport model, primarily attributable to electron-electron interactions. This insight is crucial as it paves the way for developing a more comprehensive and precise model, enhancing our understanding of molecular-scale electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Binary Classification Via Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric binary candidates have risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to automatically classify whether a set of stars belong to an astrometric binary pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia DR3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores, with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991, and an AUC of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of astrometric binaries.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Pipeline for Large-Scale Portfolio Optimization with Applications to Near-Term Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrially relevant constrained optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization and portfolio rebalancing, are often intractable or difficult to solve exactly. In this work, we propose and benchmark a decomposition pipeline targeting portfolio optimization and rebalancing problems with constraints. The pipeline decomposes the optimization problem into constrained subproblems, which are then solved separately and aggregated to give a final result. Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>PASS: An Asynchronous Probabilistic Processor for Next Generation Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New computing paradigms are required to solve the most challenging computational problems where no exact polynomial time solution exists.Probabilistic Ising Accelerators has gained promise on these problems with the ability to model complex probability distributions and find ground states of intractable problems. In this context, we have demonstrated the Parallel Asynchronous Stochastic Sampler (PASS), the first fully on-chip integrated, asynchronous, probabilistic accelerator that takes advantage of the intrinsic fine-grained parallelism of the Ising Model and built in state of the art 14nm CMOS FinFET technology. We have demonstrated broad applicability of this accelerator on problems ranging from Combinatorial Optimization, Neural Simulation, to Machine Learning along with up to $23,000$x energy to solution improvement compared to CPUs on probabilistic problems.</description>

      <title>J-UBIK: The JAX-accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from multiple instruments. To facilitate the high-fidelity imaging of these signals, we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we present J-UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the JAX-accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J-UBIK streamlines the implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X-ray observations, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for the near- and mid-infrared. The aim is to expand this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J-UBIK enables efficient generation of high-fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored to specific research objectives.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Deconvolution with Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many experimental contexts, it is necessary to statistically remove the impact of instrumental effects in order to physically interpret measurements. This task has been extensively studied in particle physics, where the deconvolution task is called unfolding. A number of recent methods have shown how to perform high-dimensional, unbinned unfolding using machine learning. However, one of the assumptions in all of these methods is that the detector response is accurately modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation. In practice, the detector response depends on a number of nuisance parameters that can be constrained with data. We propose a new algorithm called Profile OmniFold (POF), which works in a similar iterative manner as the OmniFold (OF) algorithm while being able to simultaneously profile the nuisance parameters. We illustrate the method with a Gaussian example as a proof of concept highlighting its promising capabilities.</description>

      <title>The Profiled Feldman-Cousins technique for confidence interval construction in the presence of nuisance parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring observables to constrain models using maximum-likelihood estimation is fundamental to many physics experiments. Wilks' theorem provides a simple way to construct confidence intervals on model parameters, but it only applies under certain conditions. These conditions, such as nested hypotheses and unbounded parameters, are often violated in neutrino oscillation measurements and other experimental scenarios. Monte Carlo methods can address these issues, albeit at increased computational cost. In the presence of nuisance parameters, however, the best way to implement a Monte Carlo method is ambiguous. Here, we present the method used in the NOvA experiment, which we call `Profiled Feldman--Cousins.' We show that it achieves more accurate frequentist coverage in toy experiments approximating a neutrino oscillation measurement than other methods commonly in use. Finally, we describe an implementation of this method in the context of the NOvA experiment.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Extraction Against Non-Stationary Instrumental Noises with Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sapce-borne gravitational wave antennas, such as LISA and LISA-like mission (Taiji and Tianqin), will offer novel perspectives for exploring our Universe while introduce new challenges, especially in data analysis. Aside from the known challenges like high parameter space dimension, superposition of large number of signals etc., gravitational wave detections in space would be more seriously affected by anomalies or non-stationarities in the science measurements. Considering the three types of foreseeable non-stationarities including data gaps, transients (glitches), and time-varying noise auto-correlations, which may come from routine maintenance or unexpected disturbances during science operations, we developed a deep learning model for accurate signal extractions confronted with such anomalous scenarios. Our model exhibits the same performance as the current state-of-the-art models do for the ideal and anomaly free scenario, while shows remarkable adaptability in extractions of coalescing massive black hole binary signal against all three types of non-stationarities and even their mixtures. This also provide new explorations into the robustness studies of deep learning models for data processing in space-borne gravitational wave missions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-aware summary statistic from data batches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signal-agnostic data exploration based on machine learning could unveil very subtle statistical deviations of collider data from the expected Standard Model of particle physics. The beneficial impact of a large training sample on machine learning solutions motivates the exploration of increasingly large and inclusive samples of acquired data with resource efficient computational methods. In this work we consider the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a multivariate goodness-of-fit test built on the Neyman-Pearson maximum-likelihood-ratio construction, and we address the problem of testing large size samples under computational and storage resource constraints. We propose to perform parallel NPLM routines over batches of the data, and to combine them by locally aggregating over the data-to-reference density ratios learnt by each batch. The resulting data hypothesis defining the likelihood-ratio test is thus shared over the batches, and complies with the assumption that the expected rate of new physical processes is time invariant. We show that this method outperforms the simple sum of the independent tests run over the batches, and can recover, or even surpass, the sensitivity of the single test run over the full data. Beside the significant advantage for the offline application of NPLM to large size samples, the proposed approach offers new prospects toward the use of NPLM to construct anomaly-aware summary statistics in quasi-online data streaming scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is known as a powerful machine learning approach for learning complex dynamics from limited data. Here, we use RC to predict highly stochastic dynamics of cell shapes. We find that RC is able to predict the steady state climate from very limited data. Furthermore, the RC learns the timescale of transients from only four observations. We find that these capabilities of the RC to act as a dynamic twin allows us to also infer important statistics of cell shape dynamics of unobserved conditions.</description>
