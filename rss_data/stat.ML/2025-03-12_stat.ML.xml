      <title>Probabilistic Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint. However, strict safety guarantees are often provided through approaches based on linear programming, and thus have limited scaling. In this paper we present a new, scalable method, which enjoys strict formal guarantees for Safe RL, in the case where the safety dynamics of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) are known, and safety is defined as an undiscounted probabilistic avoidance property. Our approach is based on state-augmentation of the MDP, and on the design of a shield that restricts the actions available to the agent. We show that our approach provides a strict formal safety guarantee that the agent stays safe at training and test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is viable in practice through experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Personalized Convolutional Dictionary Learning of Physiological Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human physiological signals tend to exhibit both global and local structures: the former are shared across a population, while the latter reflect inter-individual variability. For instance, kinetic measurements of the gait cycle during locomotion present common characteristics, although idiosyncrasies may be observed due to biomechanical disposition or pathology. To better represent datasets with local-global structure, this work extends Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL), a popular method for learning interpretable representations, or dictionaries, of time-series data. In particular, we propose Personalized CDL (PerCDL), in which a local dictionary models local information as a personalized spatiotemporal transformation of a global dictionary. The transformation is learnable and can combine operations such as time warping and rotation. Formal computational and statistical guarantees for PerCDL are provided and its effectiveness on synthetic and real human locomotion data is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and posterior sampling for network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network reconstruction is the task of inferring the unseen interactions between elements of a system, based only on their behavior or dynamics. This inverse problem is in general ill-posed, and admits many solutions for the same observation. Nevertheless, the vast majority of statistical methods proposed for this task -- formulated as the inference of a graphical generative model -- can only produce a ``point estimate,'' i.e. a single network considered the most likely. In general, this can give only a limited characterization of the reconstruction, since uncertainties and competing answers cannot be conveyed, even if their probabilities are comparable, while being structurally different. In this work we present an efficient MCMC algorithm for sampling from posterior distributions of reconstructed networks, which is able to reveal the full population of answers for a given reconstruction problem, weighted according to their plausibilities. Our algorithm is general, since it does not rely on specific properties of particular generative models, and is specially suited for the inference of large and sparse networks, since in this case an iteration can be performed in time $O(N\log^2 N)$ for a network of $N$ nodes, instead of $O(N^2)$, as would be the case for a more naive approach. We demonstrate the suitability of our method in providing uncertainties and consensus of solutions (which provably increases the reconstruction accuracy) in a variety of synthetic and empirical cases.</description>

      <title>Pure Exploration with Feedback Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of pure exploration in an online learning problem with a feedback graph. This graph dictates the feedback available to the learner, covering scenarios between full-information, pure bandit feedback, and settings with no feedback on the chosen action. While variants of this problem have been investigated for regret minimization, no prior work has addressed the pure exploration setting, which is the focus of our study. We derive an instance-specific lower bound on the sample complexity of learning the best action with fixed confidence, even when the feedback graph is unknown and stochastic, and present unidentifiability results for Bernoulli rewards. Additionally, our findings reveal how the sample complexity scales with key graph-dependent quantities. Lastly, we introduce TaS-FG (Track and Stop for Feedback Graphs), an asymptotically optimal algorithm, and demonstrate its efficiency across different graph configurations.</description>

      <title>Cost-Aware Optimal Pairwise Pure Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure exploration is one of the fundamental problems in multi-armed bandits (MAB). However, existing works mostly focus on specific pure exploration tasks, without a holistic view of the general pure exploration problem. This work fills this gap by introducing a versatile framework to study pure exploration, with a focus on identifying the pairwise relationships between targeted arm pairs. Moreover, unlike existing works that only optimize the stopping time (i.e., sample complexity), this work considers that arms are associated with potentially different costs and targets at optimizing the cumulative cost that occurred during learning. Under the general framework of pairwise pure exploration with arm-specific costs, a performance lower bound is derived. Then, a novel algorithm, termed CAET (Cost-Aware Pairwise Exploration Task), is proposed. CAET builds on the track-and-stop principle with a novel design to handle the arm-specific costs, which can potentially be zero and thus represent a very challenging case. Theoretical analyses prove that the performance of CAET approaches the lower bound asymptotically. Special cases are further discussed, including an extension to regret minimization, which is another major focus of MAB. The effectiveness and efficiency of CAET are also verified through experimental results under various settings.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Learning with Autoregressive Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given base class of sequence-to-next-token generators, we consider learning prompt-to-answer mappings obtained by iterating a fixed, time-invariant generator for multiple steps, thus generating a chain-of-thought, and then taking the final token as the answer. We formalize the learning problems both when the chain-of-thought is observed and when training only on prompt-answer pairs, with the chain-of-thought latent. We analyze the sample and computational complexity both in terms of general properties of the base class (e.g. its VC dimension) and for specific base classes such as linear thresholds. We present a simple base class that allows for universal representability and computationally tractable chain-of-thought learning. Central to our development is that time invariance allows for sample complexity that is independent of the length of the chain-of-thought. Attention arises naturally in our construction.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting and the Geometry of the Ridge Regression Solution in Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of ridge regression in an overparameterized binary classification task. We assume examples are drawn from (anisotropic) class-conditional cluster distributions with opposing means and we allow for the training labels to have a constant level of label-flipping noise. We characterize the classification error achieved by ridge regression under the assumption that the covariance matrix of the cluster distribution has a high effective rank in the tail. We show that ridge regression has qualitatively different behavior depending on the scale of the cluster mean vector and its interaction with the covariance matrix of the cluster distributions. In regimes where the scale is very large, the conditions that allow for benign overfitting turn out to be the same as those for the regression task. We additionally provide insights into how the introduction of label noise affects the behavior of the minimum norm interpolator (MNI). The optimal classifier in this setting is a linear transformation of the cluster mean vector and in the noiseless setting the MNI approximately learns this transformation. On the other hand, the introduction of label noise can significantly change the geometry of the solution while preserving the same qualitative behavior.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Deep ReLU CNN Approximation for Korobov Functions: A Constructive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates approximation capabilities of two-dimensional (2D) deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with Korobov functions serving as a benchmark. We focus on 2D CNNs, comprising multi-channel convolutional layers with zero-padding and ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. We propose a fully constructive approach for building 2D CNNs to approximate Korobov functions and provide rigorous analysis of the complexity of the constructed networks. Our results demonstrate that 2D CNNs achieve near-optimal approximation rates under the continuous weight selection model, significantly alleviating the curse of dimensionality. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for 2D CNNs and illustrates their potential for broader applications in function approximation.</description>

      <title>Computational bottlenecks for denoising diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusions provide a general strategy to sample from a probability distribution $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by constructing a stochastic process $(\hat{\boldsymbol x}_t:t\ge 0)$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$ such that the distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}_T$ at large times $T$ approximates $\mu$. The drift ${\boldsymbol m}:{\mathbb R}^d\times{\mathbb R}\to{\mathbb R}^d$ of this diffusion process is learned from data (samples from $\mu$) by minimizing the so-called score-matching objective. In order for the generating process to be efficient, it must be possible to evaluate (an approximation of) ${\boldsymbol m}({\boldsymbol y},t)$ in polynomial time.
  Is every probability distribution $\mu$, for which sampling is tractable, also amenable to sampling via diffusions? We provide evidence to the contrary by constructing a probability distribution $\mu$ for which sampling is easy, but the drift of the diffusion process is intractable -- under a popular conjecture on information-computation gaps in statistical estimation. We further show that any polynomial-time computable drift can be modified in a way that changes minimally the score matching objective and yet results in incorrect sampling.</description>

      <title>Locally Private Nonparametric Contextual Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by privacy concerns in sequential decision-making on sensitive data, we address the challenge of nonparametric contextual multi-armed bandits (MAB) under local differential privacy (LDP). We develop a uniform-confidence-bound-type estimator, showing its minimax optimality supported by a matching minimax lower bound. We further consider the case where auxiliary datasets are available, subject also to (possibly heterogeneous) LDP constraints. Under the widely-used covariate shift framework, we propose a jump-start scheme to effectively utilize the auxiliary data, the minimax optimality of which is further established by a matching lower bound. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and underscore the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Median Consensus Embedding for Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes median consensus embedding (MCE) to address variability in low-dimensional embeddings caused by random initialization in dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. MCE is defined as the geometric median of multiple embeddings. By assuming multiple embeddings as independent and identically distributed random samples and applying large deviation theory, we prove that MCE achieves consistency at an exponential rate. Furthermore, we develop a practical algorithm to implement MCE by constructing a distance function between embeddings based on the Frobenius norm of the pairwise distance matrix of data points. Application to real-world data demonstrates that MCE converges rapidly and significantly reduces instability. These results confirm that MCE effectively mitigates random initialization issues in embedding methods.</description>

      <title>How good is PAC-Bayes at explaining generalisation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss necessary conditions for a PAC-Bayes bound to provide a meaningful generalisation guarantee. Our analysis reveals that the optimal generalisation guarantee depends solely on the distribution of the risk induced by the prior distribution. In particular, achieving a target generalisation level is only achievable if the prior places sufficient mass on high-performing predictors. We relate these requirements to the prevalent practice of using data-dependent priors in deep learning PAC-Bayes applications, and discuss the implications for the claim that PAC-Bayes ``explains'' generalisation.</description>

      <title>Massively Parallel Expectation Maximization For Approximate Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for hierarchical models can be very challenging. MCMC methods have difficulty scaling to large models with many observations and latent variables. While variational inference (VI) and reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) can be more scalable, they are gradient-based methods and so often require many iterations to converge. Our key insight was that modern massively parallel importance weighting methods (Bowyer et al., 2024) give fast and accurate posterior moment estimates, and we can use these moment estimates to rapidly learn an approximate posterior. Specifically, we propose using expectation maximization to fit the approximate posterior, which we call QEM. The expectation step involves computing the posterior moments using high-quality massively parallel estimates from Bowyer et al. (2024). The maximization step involves fitting the approximate posterior using these moments, which can be done straightforwardly for simple approximate posteriors such as Gaussian, Gamma, Beta, Dirichlet, Binomial, Multinomial, Categorical, etc. (or combinations thereof). We show that QEM is faster than state-of-the-art, massively parallel variants of RWS and VI, and is invariant to reparameterizations of the model that dramatically slow down gradient based methods.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Induced Global Matrix Autoregressive Model with Auxiliary Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jointly modeling and forecasting economic and financial variables across a large set of countries has long been a significant challenge. Two primary approaches have been utilized to address this issue: the vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) and the matrix autoregression (MAR). The VARX model captures domestic dependencies, but treats variables exogenous to represent global factors driven by international trade. In contrast, the MAR model simultaneously considers variables from multiple countries but ignores the trade network. In this paper, we propose an extension of the MAR model that achieves these two aims at once, i.e., studying both international dependencies and the impact of the trade network on the global economy. Additionally, we introduce a sparse component to the model to differentiate between systematic and idiosyncratic cross-predictability. To estimate the model parameters, we propose both a likelihood estimation method and a bias-corrected alternating minimization version. We provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the model's properties, alongside presenting intriguing economic insights derived from our findings.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion Model in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</description>

      <title>dnamite: A Python Package for Neural Additive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive models offer accurate and interpretable predictions for tabular data, a critical tool for statistical modeling. Recent advances in Neural Additive Models (NAMs) allow these models to handle complex machine learning tasks, including feature selection and survival analysis, on large-scale data. This paper introduces dnamite, a Python package that implements NAMs for these advanced applications. dnamite provides a scikit-learn style interface to train regression, classification, and survival analysis NAMs, with built-in support for feature selection. We describe the methodology underlying dnamite, its design principles, and its implementation. Through an application to the MIMIC III clinical dataset, we demonstrate the utility of dnamite in a real-world setting where feature selection and survival analysis are both important. The package is publicly available via pip and documented at dnamite.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Positive Non-Clashing Teaching in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical and parameterized complexity of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension of a set of concepts, that is, the smallest number of examples per concept required to successfully teach an intelligent learner under the considered, previously established model. For any class of concepts, it is known that this problem can be effortlessly transferred to the setting of balls in a graph G. We establish (1) the NP-hardness of the problem even when restricted to instances with positive non-clashing teaching dimension k=2 and where all balls in the graph are present, (2) near-tight running time upper and lower bounds for the problem on general graphs, (3) fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the vertex integrity of G, and (4) a lower bound excluding fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the feedback vertex number and pathwidth of G, even when combined with k. Our results provide a nearly complete understanding of the complexity landscape of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension and answer open questions from the literature.</description>

      <title>TwinTURBO: Semi-Supervised Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models via Mutual Information Decompositions for Downstream Task and Latent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-supervised fine-tuning framework for foundation models that utilises mutual information decomposition to address the challenges of training for a limited amount of labelled data. Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanations for Model Ensembles Using Entropic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations indicate the smallest change in input that can translate to a different outcome for a machine learning model. Counterfactuals have generated immense interest in high-stakes applications such as finance, education, hiring, etc. In several use-cases, the decision-making process often relies on an ensemble of models rather than just one. Despite significant research on counterfactuals for one model, the problem of generating a single counterfactual explanation for an ensemble of models has received limited interest. Each individual model might lead to a different counterfactual, whereas trying to find a counterfactual accepted by all models might significantly increase cost (effort). We propose a novel strategy to find the counterfactual for an ensemble of models using the perspective of entropic risk measure. Entropic risk is a convex risk measure that satisfies several desirable properties. We incorporate our proposed risk measure into a novel constrained optimization to generate counterfactuals for ensembles that stay valid for several models. The main significance of our measure is that it provides a knob that allows for the generation of counterfactuals that stay valid under an adjustable fraction of the models. We also show that a limiting case of our entropic-risk-based strategy yields a counterfactual valid for all models in the ensemble (worst-case min-max approach). We study the trade-off between the cost (effort) for the counterfactual and its validity for an ensemble by varying degrees of risk aversion, as determined by our risk parameter knob. We validate our performance on real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for density-based clustering in high-dimensional spaces that combines Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with the Quick Shift algorithm. The Quick Shift algorithm, known for its hierarchical clustering capabilities, is extended by integrating approximate Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) using LSH to provide efficient density estimates. The proposed approach achieves almost linear time complexity while preserving the consistency of density-based clustering.</description>

Abstract: In recent years the information asymmetric Lipschitz bandits In this paper we studied the Lipschitz bandit problem applied to the multiplayer information asymmetric problem studied in \cite{chang2022online, chang2023optimal}. More specifically we consider information asymmetry in rewards, actions, or both. We adopt the CAB algorithm given in \cite{kleinberg2004nearly} which uses a fixed discretization to give regret bounds of the same order (in the dimension of the action) space in all 3 problem settings. We also adopt their zooming algorithm \cite{ kleinberg2008multi}which uses an adaptive discretization and apply it to information asymmetry in rewards and information asymmetry in actions.</description>

      <title>Empirical Error Estimates for Graph Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph sparsification is a well-established technique for accelerating graph-based learning algorithms, which uses edge sampling to approximate dense graphs with sparse ones. Because the sparsification error is random and unknown, users must contend with uncertainty about the reliability of downstream computations. Although it is possible for users to obtain conceptual guidance from theoretical error bounds in the literature, such results are typically impractical at a numerical level. Taking an alternative approach, we propose to address these issues from a data-driven perspective by computing empirical error estimates. The proposed error estimates are highly versatile, and we demonstrate this in four use cases: Laplacian matrix approximation, graph cut queries, graph-structured regression, and spectral clustering. Moreover, we provide two theoretical guarantees for the error estimates, and explain why the cost of computing them is manageable in comparison to the overall cost of a typical graph sparsification workflow.</description>

      <title>Controlling Latent Diffusion Using Latent CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.</description>

      <title>Minimax Estimation for Personalized Federated Learning: An Alternative between FedAvg and Local Training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.01901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely recognized difficulty in federated learning arises from the statistical heterogeneity among clients: local datasets often originate from distinct yet not entirely unrelated probability distributions, and personalization is, therefore, necessary to achieve optimal results from each individual's perspective. In this paper, we show how the excess risks of personalized federated learning using a smooth, strongly convex loss depend on data heterogeneity from a minimax point of view, with a focus on the FedAvg algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017) and pure local training (i.e., clients solve empirical risk minimization problems on their local datasets without any communication). Our main result reveals an approximate alternative between these two baseline algorithms for federated learning: the former algorithm is minimax rate optimal over a collection of instances when data heterogeneity is small, whereas the latter is minimax rate optimal when data heterogeneity is large, and the threshold is sharp up to a constant.
  As an implication, our results show that from a worst-case point of view, a dichotomous strategy that makes a choice between the two baseline algorithms is rate-optimal. Another implication is that the popular FedAvg following by local fine tuning strategy is also minimax optimal under additional regularity conditions. Our analysis relies on a new notion of algorithmic stability that takes into account the nature of federated learning.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Sampling Method via Maximum Mean Discrepancy Flow with Adaptive Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic sampling method to approximate a target distribution $\rho^*$ by minimizing the kernel discrepancy, also known as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). By employing the general \emph{energetic variational inference} framework (Wang et al., 2021), we convert the problem of minimizing MMD to solving a dynamic ODE system of the particles. We adopt the implicit Euler numerical scheme to solve the ODE systems. This leads to a proximal minimization problem in each iteration of updating the particles, which can be solved by optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS. The proposed method is named EVI-MMD. To overcome the long-existing issue of bandwidth selection of the Gaussian kernel, we propose a novel way to specify the bandwidth dynamically. Through comprehensive numerical studies, we have shown the proposed adaptive bandwidth significantly improves the EVI-MMD. We use the EVI-MMD algorithm to solve two types of sampling problems. In the first type, the target distribution is given by a fully specified density function. The second type is a "two-sample problem", where only training data are available. The EVI-MMD method is used as a generative learning model to generate new samples that follow the same distribution as the training data. With the recommended settings of the tuning parameters, we show that the proposed EVI-MMD method outperforms some existing methods for both types of problems.</description>

      <title>Computing high-dimensional optimal transport by flow neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11857v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing optimal transport (OT) for general high-dimensional data has been a long-standing challenge. Despite much progress, most of the efforts including neural network methods have been focused on the static formulation of the OT problem. The current work proposes to compute the dynamic OT between two arbitrary distributions $P$ and $Q$ by optimizing a flow model, where both distributions are only accessible via finite samples. Our method learns the dynamic OT by finding an invertible flow that minimizes the transport cost. The trained optimal transport flow subsequently allows for performing many downstream tasks, including infinitesimal density ratio estimation (DRE) and domain adaptation by interpolating distributions in the latent space. The effectiveness of the proposed model on high-dimensional data is demonstrated by strong empirical performance on OT baselines, image-to-image translation, and high-dimensional DRE.</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees of Group-Invariant GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first statistical performance guarantees for group-invariant generative models. Many real data, such as images and molecules, are invariant to certain group symmetries, which can be taken advantage of to learn more efficiently as we rigorously demonstrate in this work. Here we specifically study generative adversarial networks (GANs), and quantify the gains when incorporating symmetries into the model. Group-invariant GANs are a type of GANs in which the generators and discriminators are hardwired with group symmetries. Empirical studies have shown that these networks are capable of learning group-invariant distributions with significantly improved data efficiency. In this study, we aim to rigorously quantify this improvement by analyzing the reduction in sample complexity and in the discriminator approximation error for group-invariant GANs. Our findings indicate that when learning group-invariant distributions, the number of samples required for group-invariant GANs decreases proportionally by a factor of the group size and the discriminator approximation error has a reduced lower bound. Importantly, the overall error reduction cannot be achieved merely through data augmentation on the training data. Numerical results substantiate our theory and highlight the stark contrast between learning with group-invariant GANs and using data augmentation. This work also sheds light on the study of other generative models with group symmetries, such as score-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution robustness for multivariate analysis via causal regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a regularisation strategy of classical machine learning algorithms rooted in causality that ensures robustness against distribution shifts. Building upon the anchor regression framework, we demonstrate how incorporating a straightforward regularisation term into the loss function of classical multivariate analysis algorithms, such as (orthonormalized) partial least squares, reduced-rank regression, and multiple linear regression, enables out-of-distribution generalisation. Our framework allows users to efficiently verify the compatibility of a loss function with the regularisation strategy. Estimators for selected algorithms are provided, showcasing consistency and efficacy in synthetic and real-world climate science problems. The empirical validation highlights the versatility of anchor regularisation, emphasizing its compatibility with multivariate analysis approaches and its role in enhancing replicability while guarding against distribution shifts. The extended anchor framework advances causal inference methodologies, addressing the need for reliable out-of-distribution generalisation.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Linear MDPs via Approximation by Discounted-Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning with linear Markov decision processes (MDPs). The associated Bellman operator of the problem not being a contraction makes the algorithm design challenging. Previous approaches either suffer from computational inefficiency or require strong assumptions on dynamics, such as ergodicity, for achieving a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with computational complexity polynomial in the problem parameters, without making strong assumptions on dynamics. Our approach approximates the average-reward setting by a discounted MDP with a carefully chosen discounting factor, and then applies an optimistic value iteration. We propose an algorithmic structure that plans for a nonstationary policy through optimistic value iteration and follows that policy until a specified information metric in the collected data doubles. Additionally, we introduce a value function clipping procedure for limiting the span of the value function for sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Geometrical properties of regularized Kernel Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by Bach [2022]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that the divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as finite-sample bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution.</description>

      <title>A Practical Theory of Generalization in Selectivity Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query-driven machine learning models have emerged as a promising estimation technique for query selectivities. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the efficacy of these techniques from a theoretical perspective, as there exist substantial gaps between practical solutions and state-of-the-art (SOTA) theory based on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gaps between theory and practice. First, we demonstrate that selectivity predictors induced by signed measures are learnable, which relaxes the reliance on probability measures in SOTA theory. More importantly, beyond the PAC learning framework (which only allows us to characterize how the model behaves when both training and test workloads are drawn from the same distribution), we establish, under mild assumptions, that selectivity predictors from this class exhibit favorable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error bounds.
  These theoretical advances provide us with a better understanding of both the in-distribution and OOD generalization capabilities of query-driven selectivity learning, and facilitate the design of two general strategies to improve OOD generalization for existing query-driven selectivity models. We empirically verify that our techniques help query-driven selectivity models generalize significantly better to OOD queries both in terms of prediction accuracy and query latency performance, while maintaining their superior in-distribution generalization performance.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference in Location-Scale Families: Exact Recovery of the Mean and Correlation Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an intractable target density $p$, variational inference (VI) attempts to find the best approximation $q$ from a tractable family $Q$. This is typically done by minimizing the exclusive Kullback-Leibler divergence, $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In practice, $Q$ is not rich enough to contain $p$, and the approximation is misspecified even when it is a unique global minimizer of $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of VI to these misspecifications when $p$ exhibits certain symmetries and $Q$ is a location-scale family that shares these symmetries. We prove strong guarantees for VI not only under mild regularity conditions but also in the face of severe misspecifications. Namely, we show that (i) VI recovers the mean of $p$ when $p$ exhibits an \textit{even} symmetry, and (ii) it recovers the correlation matrix of $p$ when in addition~$p$ exhibits an \textit{elliptical} symmetry. These guarantees hold for the mean even when $q$ is factorized and $p$ is not, and for the correlation matrix even when~$q$ and~$p$ behave differently in their tails. We analyze various regimes of Bayesian inference where these symmetries are useful idealizations, and we also investigate experimentally how VI behaves in their absence.</description>

      <title>HACSurv: A Hierarchical Copula-Based Approach for Survival Analysis with Dependent Competing Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In survival analysis, subjects often face competing risks; for example, individuals with cancer may also suffer from heart disease or other illnesses, which can jointly influence the prognosis of risks and censoring. Traditional survival analysis methods often treat competing risks as independent and fail to accommodate the dependencies between different conditions. In this paper, we introduce HACSurv, a survival analysis method that learns Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas structures and cause-specific survival functions from data with competing risks. HACSurv employs a flexible dependency structure using hierarchical Archimedean copulas to represent the relationships between competing risks and censoring. By capturing the dependencies between risks and censoring, HACSurv improves the accuracy of survival predictions and offers insights into risk interactions. Experiments on synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method can accurately identify the complex dependency structure and precisely predict survival distributions, whereas the compared methods exhibit significant deviations between their predictions and the true distributions. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets also demonstrate that our method achieves better survival prediction compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Conditional Dependence via U-Statistics Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of measuring conditional dependence between two random phenomena arises when a third one (a confounder) has a potential influence on the amount of information between them. A typical issue in this challenging problem is the inversion of ill-conditioned autocorrelation matrices. This paper presents a novel measure of conditional dependence based on the use of incomplete unbiased statistics of degree two, which allows to re-interpret independence as uncorrelatedness on a finite-dimensional feature space. This formulation enables to prune data according to observations of the confounder itself, thus avoiding matrix inversions altogether. The proposed approach is articulated as an extension of the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion, which becomes expressible through kernels that operate on 4-tuples of data.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

      <title>Sampling from Bayesian Neural Network Posteriors with Symmetric Minibatch Splitting Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable kinetic Langevin dynamics algorithm for sampling parameter spaces of big data and AI applications. Our scheme combines a symmetric forward/backward sweep over minibatches with a symmetric discretization of Langevin dynamics. For a particular Langevin splitting method (UBU), we show that the resulting Symmetric Minibatch Splitting-UBU (SMS-UBU) integrator has bias $O(h^2 d^{1/2})$ in dimension $d&gt;0$ with stepsize $h&gt;0$, despite only using one minibatch per iteration, thus providing excellent control of the sampling bias as a function of the stepsize. We apply the algorithm to explore local modes of the posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and evaluate the calibration performance of the posterior predictive probabilities for neural networks with convolutional neural network architectures for classification problems on three different datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Celeb-A and chest X-ray). Our results indicate that BNNs sampled with SMS-UBU can offer significantly better calibration performance compared to standard methods of training and stochastic weight averaging.</description>

      <title>Minimum Empirical Divergence for Sub-Gaussian Linear Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel linear bandit algorithm called LinMED (Linear Minimum Empirical Divergence), which is a linear extension of the MED algorithm that was originally designed for multi-armed bandits. LinMED is a randomized algorithm that admits a closed-form computation of the arm sampling probabilities, unlike the popular randomized algorithm called linear Thompson sampling. Such a feature proves useful for off-policy evaluation where the unbiased evaluation requires accurately computing the sampling probability. We prove that LinMED enjoys a near-optimal regret bound of $d\sqrt{n}$ up to logarithmic factors where $d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the time horizon. We further show that LinMED enjoys a $\frac{d^2}{\Delta}\left(\log^2(n)\right)\log\left(\log(n)\right)$ problem-dependent regret where $\Delta$ is the smallest sub-optimality gap. Our empirical study shows that LinMED has a competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics Framework for Complex Engineering Systems Exhibiting Multiple Failure Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex engineering systems are often subject to multiple failure modes. Developing a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model that does not consider the failure mode causing degradation is likely to result in inaccurate predictions. However, distinguishing between causes of failure without manually inspecting the system is nontrivial. This challenge is increased when the causes of historically observed failures are unknown. Sensors, which are useful for monitoring the state-of-health of systems, can also be used for distinguishing between multiple failure modes as the presence of multiple failure modes results in discriminatory behavior of the sensor signals. When systems are equipped with multiple sensors, some sensors may exhibit behavior correlated with degradation, while other sensors do not. Furthermore, which sensors exhibit this behavior may differ for each failure mode. In this paper, we present a simultaneous clustering and sensor selection approach for unlabeled training datasets of systems exhibiting multiple failure modes. The cluster assignments and the selected sensors are then utilized in real-time to first diagnose the active failure mode and then to predict the system RUL. We validate the methodology using a simulated dataset of systems exhibiting two failure modes and on NASA turbofan degradation dataset.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite mixtures are a broad class of models useful in scenarios where observed data is generated by multiple distinct processes but without explicit information about the responsible process for each data point. Estimating Bayesian mixture models is computationally challenging due to issues such as high-dimensional posterior inference and label switching. Furthermore, traditional methods such as MCMC are applicable only if the likelihoods for each mixture component are analytically tractable.
  Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) is a simulation-based framework for estimating Bayesian models using generative neural networks. This allows the fitting of models without explicit likelihoods, and provides fast inference. ABI is therefore an attractive framework for estimating mixture models. This paper introduces a novel extension of ABI tailored to mixture models. We factorize the posterior into a distribution of the parameters and a distribution of (categorical) mixture indicators, which allows us to use a combination of generative neural networks for parameter inference, and classification networks for mixture membership identification. The proposed framework accommodates both independent and dependent mixture models, enabling filtering and smoothing. We validate and demonstrate our approach through synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Spectral-factorized Positive-definite Curvature Learning for NN Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many training methods, such as Adam(W) and Shampoo, learn a positive-definite curvature matrix and apply an inverse root before preconditioning. Recently, non-diagonal training methods, such as Shampoo, have gained significant attention; however, they remain computationally inefficient and are limited to specific types of curvature information due to the costly matrix root computation via matrix decomposition. To address this, we propose a Riemannian optimization approach that dynamically adapts spectral-factorized positive-definite curvature estimates, enabling the efficient application of arbitrary matrix roots and generic curvature learning. We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our approach in positive-definite matrix optimization and covariance adaptation for gradient-free optimization, as well as its efficiency in curvature learning for neural net training.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Overfitting along the Regularization Path for Two-Part-Code MDL in Supervised Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of the entire regularization curve of a modified two-part-code Minimum Description Length (MDL) learning rule for binary classification, based on an arbitrary prior or description language. Grunwald and Langford [2004] previously established the lack of asymptotic consistency, from an agnostic PAC (frequentist worst case) perspective, of the MDL rule with a penalty parameter of $\lambda=1$, suggesting that it underegularizes. Driven by interest in understanding how benign or catastrophic under-regularization and overfitting might be, we obtain a precise quantitative description of the worst case limiting error as a function of the regularization parameter $\lambda$ and noise level (or approximation error), significantly tightening the analysis of Grunwald and Langford for $\lambda=1$ and extending it to all other choices of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Uncertainty Benefits Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</description>

      <title>Learning Hypergraphs From Signals With Dual Smoothness Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph structure learning, which aims to learn the hypergraph structures from the observed signals to capture the intrinsic high-order relationships among the entities, becomes crucial when a hypergraph topology is not readily available in the datasets. There are two challenges that lie at the heart of this problem: 1) how to handle the huge search space of potential hyperedges, and 2) how to define meaningful criteria to measure the relationship between the signals observed on nodes and the hypergraph structure. In this paper, for the first challenge, we adopt the assumption that the ideal hypergraph structure can be derived from a learnable graph structure that captures the pairwise relations within signals. Further, we propose a hypergraph structure learning framework HGSL with a novel dual smoothness prior that reveals a mapping between the observed node signals and the hypergraph structure, whereby each hyperedge corresponds to a subgraph with both node signal smoothness and edge signal smoothness in the learnable graph structure. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HGSL on both synthetic and real world datasets. Experiments show that HGSL can efficiently infer meaningful hypergraph topologies from observed signals.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online SGD in High-dimensional Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has emerged as the quintessential method in a data scientist's toolbox. Using SGD for high-stakes applications requires, however, careful quantification of the associated uncertainty. Towards that end, in this work, we establish a high-dimensional Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for linear functionals of online SGD iterates for overparametrized least-squares regression with non-isotropic Gaussian inputs. We first show that a bias-corrected CLT holds when the number of iterations of the online SGD, $t$, grows sub-linearly in the dimensionality, $d$. In order to use the developed result in practice, we further develop an online approach for estimating the variance term appearing in the CLT, and establish high-probability bounds for the developed online estimator. Together with the CLT result, this provides a fully online and data-driven way to numerically construct confidence intervals. This enables practical high-dimensional algorithmic inference with SGD and to the best of our knowledge, is the first such result.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses large dimensional covariance matrix estimation with unknown mean. The empirical covariance estimator fails when dimension and number of samples are proportional and tend to infinity, settings known as Kolmogorov asymptotics. When the mean is known, Ledoit and Wolf (2004) proposed a linear shrinkage estimator and proved its convergence under those asymptotics. To the best of our knowledge, no formal proof has been proposed when the mean is unknown. To address this issue, we propose to extend the linear shrinkage and its convergence properties to translation-invariant estimators. We expose four estimators respecting those conditions, proving their properties. Finally, we show empirically that a new estimator we propose outperforms other standard estimators.</description>

      <title>SketchOGD: Memory-Efficient Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: When machine learning models are trained continually on a sequence of tasks, they are often liable to forget what they learned on previous tasks--a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper develops a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting using the idea of matrix sketching, in the context of a simple continual learning algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD finds weight updates that aim to preserve performance on prior datapoints, using gradients of the model on those datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual learning over long time horizons. To address this problem, we propose SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed, user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD, SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD. Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Structure Inference From Data Under Smoothness Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing hypergraph structure inference methods.</description>

      <title>Multiple Testing of Linear Forms for Noisy Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important tasks of large-scale recommender systems can be naturally cast as testing multiple linear forms for noisy matrix completion. These problems, however, present unique challenges because of the subtle bias-and-variance tradeoff of and an intricate dependence among the estimated entries induced by the low-rank structure. In this paper, we develop a general approach to overcome these difficulties by introducing new statistics for individual tests with sharp asymptotics both marginally and jointly, and utilizing them to control the false discovery rate (FDR) via a data splitting and symmetric aggregation scheme. We show that valid FDR control can be achieved with guaranteed power under nearly optimal sample size requirements using the proposed methodology. Extensive numerical simulations and real data examples are also presented to further illustrate its practical merits.</description>

      <title>Standard Gaussian Process is All You Need for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02746v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing belief holds that Bayesian Optimization (BO) with standard Gaussian processes (GP) -- referred to as standard BO -- underperforms in high-dimensional optimization problems. While this belief seems plausible, it lacks both robust empirical evidence and theoretical justification. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation. First, through a comprehensive evaluation across twelve benchmarks, we found that while the popular Square Exponential (SE) kernel often leads to poor performance, using Mat\'ern kernels enables standard BO to consistently achieve top-tier results, frequently surpassing methods specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization. Second, our theoretical analysis reveals that the SE kernel's failure primarily stems from improper initialization of the length-scale parameters, which are commonly used in practice but can cause gradient vanishing in training. We provide a probabilistic bound to characterize this issue, showing that Mat\'ern kernels are less susceptible and can robustly handle much higher dimensions. Third, we propose a simple robust initialization strategy that dramatically improves the performance of the SE kernel, bringing it close to state-of-the-art methods, without requiring additional priors or regularization. We prove another probabilistic bound that demonstrates how the gradient vanishing issue can be effectively mitigated with our method. Our findings advocate for a re-evaluation of standard BO's potential in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>The VampPrior Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widely used deep latent variable models (DLVMs), in particular Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), employ overly simplistic priors on the latent space. To achieve strong clustering performance, existing methods that replace the standard normal prior with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) require defining the number of clusters to be close to the number of expected ground truth classes a-priori and are susceptible to poor initializations. We leverage VampPrior concepts (Tomczak and Welling, 2018) to fit a Bayesian GMM prior, resulting in the VampPrior Mixture Model (VMM), a novel prior for DLVMs. In a VAE, the VMM attains highly competitive clustering performance on benchmark datasets. Integrating the VMM into scVI (Lopez et al., 2018), a popular scRNA-seq integration method, significantly improves its performance and automatically arranges cells into clusters with similar biological characteristics.</description>

      <title>Perfect Recovery for Random Geometric Graph Matching with Shallow Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the graph matching problem in the presence of vertex feature information using shallow graph neural networks. Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</description>

      <title>Does SGD really happen in tiny subspaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature and intricate loss landscapes. Recent studies have revealed that, along the training trajectory, the gradient approximately aligns with a low-rank top eigenspace of the training loss Hessian, referred to as the dominant subspace. Given this alignment, this paper explores whether neural networks can be trained within the dominant subspace, which, if feasible, could lead to more efficient training methods. Our primary observation is that when the SGD update is projected onto the dominant subspace, the training loss does not decrease further. This suggests that the observed alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace is spurious. Surprisingly, projecting out the dominant subspace proves to be just as effective as the original update, despite removing the majority of the original update component. We observe similar behavior across practical setups, including the large learning rate regime (also known as Edge of Stability), Sharpness-Aware Minimization, momentum, and adaptive optimizers. We discuss the main causes and implications of this spurious alignment, shedding light on the dynamics of neural network training.</description>

      <title>Selecting the Number of Communities for Weighted Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to select the number of communities for weighted networks without a full likelihood modeling. First, we propose a novel weighted degree-corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM), where the mean adjacency matrix is modeled in the same way as in the standard DCSBM, while the variance profile matrix is assumed to be related to the mean adjacency matrix through a given variance function. Our method of selecting the number of communities is based on a sequential testing framework. In each step, the weighted DCSBM is fitted via some spectral clustering method. A key component of our method is matrix scaling on the estimated variance profile matrix. The resulting scaling factors can be used to normalize the adjacency matrix, from which the test statistic is then obtained. Under mild conditions on the weighted DCSBM, our proposed procedure is shown to be consistent in estimating the true number of communities. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world network data demonstrate the desirable empirical properties of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation where hidden confounders are present, with a focus on two settings: instrumental variable regression with additional observed confounders, and proxy causal learning. Our approach uses a singular value decomposition of a conditional expectation operator, followed by a saddle-point optimization problem, which, in the context of IV regression, can be thought of as a neural net generalization of the seminal approach due to Darolles et al. [2011]. Saddle-point formulations have gathered considerable attention recently, as they can avoid double sampling bias and are amenable to modern function approximation methods. We provide experimental validation in various settings, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods on common benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular neural networks outperform nonmodular neural networks on tasks ranging from visual question answering to robotics. These performance improvements are thought to be due to modular networks' superior ability to model the compositional and combinatorial structure of real-world problems. However, a theoretical explanation of how modularity improves generalizability, and how to leverage task modularity while training networks remains elusive. Using recent theoretical progress in explaining neural network generalization, we investigate how the amount of training data required to generalize on a task varies with the intrinsic dimensionality of a task's input. We show theoretically that when applied to modularly structured tasks, while nonmodular networks require an exponential number of samples with task dimensionality, modular networks' sample complexity is independent of task dimensionality: modular networks can generalize in high dimensions. We then develop a novel learning rule for modular networks to exploit this advantage and empirically show the improved generalization of the rule, both in- and out-of-distribution, on high-dimensional, modular tasks.</description>

      <title>Transformers Provably Solve Parity Efficiently with Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides the first theoretical analysis of training transformers to solve complex problems by recursively generating intermediate states, analogous to fine-tuning for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We consider training a one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending the work on RNNs by Wies et al. (2023). We establish three key results: (1) any finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision, requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function, our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \emph{teacher forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. Our findings, supported by numerical experiments, show that task decomposition and stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT; moreover, self-consistency checking can improve multi-step reasoning ability, aligning with empirical studies of CoT.</description>

      <title>Bin-Conditional Conformal Prediction of Fatalities from Armed Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting armed conflicts is a critical area of research with the potential to save lives and mitigate suffering. While existing forecasting models offer valuable point predictions, they often lack individual-level uncertainty estimates, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. Several approaches exist to estimate uncertainty, such as parametric and Bayesian prediction intervals, bootstrapping, quantile regression, but these methods often rely on restrictive assumptions, struggle to provide well-calibrated intervals across the full range of outcomes, or are computationally intensive. Conformal prediction offers a model-agnostic alternative that guarantees a user-specified level of coverage but typically provides only marginal coverage, potentially resulting in non-uniform coverage across different regions of the outcome space. In this paper, we introduce a novel extension called bin-conditional conformal prediction (BCCP), which enhances standard conformal prediction by ensuring consistent coverage rates across user-defined subsets (bins) of the outcome variable. We apply BCCP to simulated data as well as the forecasting of fatalities from armed conflicts, and demonstrate that it provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates across various ranges of the outcome. Compared to standard conformal prediction, BCCP offers improved local coverage, though this comes at the cost of slightly wider prediction intervals.</description>

      <title>Beyond Discretization: Learning the Optimal Solution Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many applications require minimizing a family of optimization problems indexed by some hyperparameter $\lambda \in \Lambda$ to obtain an entire solution path. Traditional approaches proceed by discretizing $\Lambda$ and solving a series of optimization problems. We propose an alternative approach that parameterizes the solution path with a set of basis functions and solves a \emph{single} stochastic optimization problem to learn the entire solution path. Our method offers substantial complexity improvements over discretization. When using constant-step size SGD, the uniform error of our learned solution path relative to the true path exhibits linear convergence to a constant related to the expressiveness of the basis. When the true solution path lies in the span of the basis, this constant is zero. We also prove stronger results for special cases common in machine learning: When $\lambda \in [-1, 1]$ and the solution path is $\nu$-times differentiable, constant step-size SGD learns a path with $\epsilon$ uniform error after at most $O(\epsilon^{\frac{1}{1-\nu}} \log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, and when the solution path is analytic, it only requires $O\left(\log^2(1/\epsilon)\log\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$. By comparison, the best-known discretization schemes in these settings require at least $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ discretization points (and even more gradient calls). Finally, we propose an adaptive variant of our method that sequentially adds basis functions and demonstrates strong numerical performance through experiments.</description>

      <title>Fourier Head: Helping Large Language Models Learn Complex Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the quality of large language models has improved, there has been increased interest in using them to model non-linguistic tokens. For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns across four benchmark Atari games by as much as 377%, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric conformal prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many risk-sensitive applications require well-calibrated prediction sets over multiple, potentially correlated target variables, for which the prediction algorithm may report correlated errors. In this work, we aim to construct the conformal prediction set accounting for the joint correlation structure of the vector-valued non-conformity scores. Drawing from the rich literature on multivariate quantiles and semiparametric statistics, we propose an algorithm to estimate the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the scores, where $\alpha$ is the user-specified miscoverage rate. In particular, we flexibly estimate the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the scores using nonparametric vine copulas and improve the asymptotic efficiency of the quantile estimate using its influence function. The vine decomposition allows our method to scale well to a large number of targets. As well as guaranteeing asymptotically exact coverage, our method yields desired coverage and competitive efficiency on a range of real-world regression problems, including those with missing-at-random labels in the calibration set.</description>

      <title>Variance-Aware Linear UCB with Deep Representation for Neural Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the representation power of deep neural networks, neural upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms have shown success in contextual bandits. To further balance the exploration and exploitation, we propose Neural-$\sigma^2$-LinearUCB, a variance-aware algorithm that utilizes $\sigma^2_t$, i.e., an upper bound of the reward noise variance at round $t$, to enhance the uncertainty quantification quality of the UCB, resulting in a regret performance improvement. We provide an oracle version for our algorithm characterized by an oracle variance upper bound $\sigma^2_t$ and a practical version with a novel estimation for this variance bound. Theoretically, we provide rigorous regret analysis for both versions and prove that our oracle algorithm achieves a better regret guarantee than other neural-UCB algorithms in the neural contextual bandits setting. Empirically, our practical method enjoys a similar computational efficiency, while outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by having a better calibration and lower regret across multiple standard settings, including on the synthetic, UCI, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.</description>

      <title>Stabilized Inverse Probability Weighting via Isotonic Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse weighting with an estimated propensity score is widely used by estimation methods in causal inference to adjust for confounding bias. However, directly inverting propensity score estimates can lead to instability, bias, and excessive variability due to large inverse weights, especially when treatment overlap is limited. In this work, we propose a post-hoc calibration algorithm for inverse propensity weights that generates well-calibrated, stabilized weights from user-supplied, cross-fitted propensity score estimates. Our approach employs a variant of isotonic regression with a loss function specifically tailored to the inverse propensity weights. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we demonstrate that isotonic calibration improves the performance of doubly robust estimators of the average treatment effect.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</description>

      <title>Inductive Moment Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow at inference, and distilling them into few-step models often leads to instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</description>
