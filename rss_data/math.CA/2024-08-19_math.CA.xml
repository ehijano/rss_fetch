      <title>A Generalized Ramanujan Master Theorem and Integral Representation of Meromorphic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan's Master Theorem is a decades-old theorem in the theory of Mellin transforms which has wide applications in both mathematics and high energy physics. The unconventional method of Ramanujan in his proof of the theorem left convergence issues which were later settled by Hardy. Here we extend Ramanujan's theorem to meromorphic functions with poles of arbitrary order and observe that the new theorem produces analogues of Ramanujan's famous theorem. Moreover, we find that the theorem produces integral representations for meromorphic functions which are shown to satisfy interesting properties, opening up an avenue for further study.</description>

      <title>Onsager-Machlup functional for stochastic lattice dynamical systems driven by time-varying noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Onsager-Machlup functional of stochastic lattice dynamical systems (SLDSs) driven by time-varying noise. We extend the Onsager-Machlup functional from finite-dimensional to infinite-dimensional systems, and from constant to time-varying diffusion coefficients. We first verify the existence and uniqueness of general SLDS solutions in the infinite sequence weighted space $l^2_{\rho}$. Building on this foundation, we employ techniques such as the infinite-dimensional Girsanov transform, Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, and probability estimation of Brownian motion balls to derive the Onsager-Machlup functionals for SLDSs in $l^2_{\rho}$ space. Additionally, we use a numerical example to illustrate our theoretical findings, based on the Euler Lagrange equation corresponding to the Onsage Machup functional.</description>

      <title>Sharp maximal function estimates for Hilbert transforms along monomial curves in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any nonempty set $U\subset\R^+$, we consider the maximal operator $\h^U$ defined as $\h^Uf=\sup_{u\in U}|H^{(u)} f|$, where $H^{(u)}$ represents the Hilbert transform along the monomial curve $u\gamma(s)$. We focus on the $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ operator norm of $\h^U$ for $p\in (p_\circ(d),\infty)$, where $p_\circ(d)$ is the optimal exponent known for the $L^p$ boundedness of the maximal averaging operator obtained by Ko-Lee-Oh \cite{KLO22,KLO23} and Beltran-Guo-Hickman-Seeger \cite{BGHS}. To achieve this goal, we employ a novel bootstrapping argument to establish a maximal estimate for the Mihlin-H\"{o}rmander-type multiplier, along with utilizing the local smoothing estimate for the averaging operator and its vector-valued extension to obtain crucial decay estimates. Furthermore, our approach offers an alternative means for deriving the upper bound established in \cite{Guo20}.</description>

      <title>On a version of a multivariate integration by parts formula for Lebesgue integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional integration by parts formulas apply under the standard assumption that one of the functions is continuous and the other has bounded Hardy-Krause variation. Motivated by recently developed results in the probabilistic context of price and risk bounds, this paper provides a version of an integration by parts formula for the Lebesgue integral of measure-inducing functions which may both be discontinuous and may have infinite Hardy-Krause variation. To this end, we give a general definition of measure-inducing functions and establish various of their properties, such as a characterization in terms of Delta-monotone functions. As a consequence of the integration by parts formula, several convergence results are provided, allowing an extension of the Lebesgue integral of a measure-inducing function to the case where one integrates with respect to a continuous semi-copula. The latter class of aggregation functions includes quasi-copulas which serve as bounds for the dependence structure in many applications.</description>
