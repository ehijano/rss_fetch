      <title>Exploring electrochemical methods for 2D precision stress control in nanoscale devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the local film stress (and associated strain) provides a universal route towards exerting dynamic control on propagating fields in nanoscale geometries, and engineering controlled interactions between them. The majority of existing techniques are adapted for engineering either uniform stresses or fixed stress gradients, but there is a need to develop methods that can provide independent precision control over the local stress at the nanoscale in the 2D plane. Here, we explore electrochemical absorption of hydrogen in structured palladium thin-film electrodes, and the associated shape-dependent stress to engineer controlled, localized stresses in thin films. We discuss the prospects of this technique for precision dynamic tuning of nanoscale opto-electro-mechanical devices and the development of field-programmable non-volatile set-and-forget architectures. We also outline some of the key challenges that need to be addressed with a view towards incorporating electrochemical stress tuning methods for post-processing foundry devices.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Unitary Processor Enables Parametrized Differentiable Long-Haul Spatial Division Multiplexed Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of global data traffic demands scalable and energy-efficient optical communication systems. Spatial division multiplexing (SDM) using multicore or multimode fibers is a promising solution to overcome the capacity limit of single-mode fibers. However, long-haul SDM transmission faces significant challenges due to modal dispersion, which imposes heavy computational loads on digital signal processing (DSP) for signal equalization. Here, we propose parameterized SDM transmission, where programmable photonic unitary processors are installed at intermediate nodes. Instead of relying on conventional digital equalization only on the receiver side, our approach enables direct optimization of the SDM transmission channel itself by the programmable unitary processor, which reduces digital post-processing loads. We introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using a differentiable SDM transmission model to determine the optimal unitary transformation. As a key enabler, we first implemented telecom-grade programmable photonic unitary processor, achieving a low-loss (2.1 dB fiber-to-fiber), wideband (full C-band), polarization-independent, and high-fidelity (R2&gt;96% across the C-band) operation. We experimentally demonstrate 1300-km transmission using a three-mode fiber, achieving strong agreement between simulation and experiment. The optimized photonic processor significantly reduces modal dispersion and post-processing complexity. Our results establish a scalable framework for integrating photonic computation into the optical layer, enabling more efficient, high-capacity optical networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Fabry-Perot BICs in a Microwave Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Fabry-Perot bound states in the continuum (FP-BIC) in the GHz frequency range, formed by two ceramic discs placed inside a metallic-walled rectangular waveguide, that act as perfect reflectors at the resonant frequency. The energy becomes perfectly trapped between the discs, forming a FP-BIC, when the distance between them matches the Fabry-Perot quantization condition. We present both theoretical and experimental analyses to investigate how the total and radiative quality factors (Q factors) depend on the inter-disk distance. We gain valuable insights into the Fano features observed in the transmission spectra using the quasi-normal mode technique and temporal coupled mode theory. Notably, we find that as the system approaches the BICs, the Fano asymmetry parameters diverge, resulting in a Lorentzian transmission profile. Experimentally, we measure a radiative Q factor on the order of $10^5$, while the total Q factor, limited by material losses, remains around $10^3$. These results offer new opportunities for the application of BICs in microwave technology, significantly advancing the potential for high-performance devices.</description>

      <title>HiLAB: A Hybrid Inverse-Design Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs. Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters, produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude, accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green, and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust, multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation nanophotonic challenges.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interaction between templated molecular layers and surface lattice resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We couple a templated layer of merocyanine molecules with surface lattice resonances in a plasmonic grating. The templating of the molecular layer is achieved using a layer of aligned graphene nanoribbons, resulting in anisotropic optical properties. The anisotropy manifests itself in polarization-dependent coupling between excitons in the organic layer and lattice plasmons in the grating. We study the influence of the templating on the coupling and find that surprisingly the more orientational ordered templated layer displays a lower coupling strength than an identical amorphous merocyanine layer. Our work demonstrates the use of molecular templating in controlling the interaction of excitons with excitations in optical nanostructures.</description>

      <title>High-Q Millimeter-Wave Acoustic Resonators in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Using Higher-Order Antisymmetric Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents miniature millimeter wave (mmWave, above 30 GHz) acoustic resonators based on a single-layer thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. More specifically, we present high performance third-order antisymmetric (A3) mode laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBAR). Compared to prior demonstrations, the proposed platform features a compact footprint due to a smaller lateral wavelength and aperture. We showcase an A3 mode device operating at 39.8 GHz with a high extracted electromechanical coupling (k2) of 4%, a high 3-dB series resonance quality factor (Q_s) of 97, and a high 3-dB anti-resonance quality factor (Q_p) of 342, leading to a figure of merit (FoM=k^2*Q_p) of 13.7 with a footprint of 32x44 micron^2. To demonstrate frequency scalability, the piezoelectric film thickness is varied while keeping the device layout. As a result, we present a multitude of high-performance devices covering a wide frequency range of 30-50 GHz, validating the proposed XBAR design at mmWave.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Temporal Characterization of Living Mycelium through Dispersion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mycelium, a natural and sustainable material, possesses unique electrical, mechanical, and biological properties that make it a promising candidate for biosensor applications. These properties include its ability to conduct electrical signals, respond to external stimuli such as humidity and mechanical stress, and grow integrally within structures to form a natural network. Such characteristics suggest its potential for integration into self-sensing systems to monitor vibrations, deformations, and environmental conditions in buildings and infrastructure. To understand the output voltage generated by these biomaterials in response to an applied electrical input, it is essential to characterize their spatial and temporal properties. This study introduces an electrical impedance network model to describe signal transmission through mycelium. In combination with the inhomogeneous wave correlation (IWC) method, commonly used in elastic wave propagation, we demonstrate the dispersion behavior of living mycelium both theoretically and experimentally. We reveal the frequency-dependent and spatial attenuation of electrical signals in living, dehydrated, and rehydrated mycelium, emphasizing the critical role of humidity in enabling effective signal sensing. Furthermore, dispersion analysis is used to assess the homogeneity of mycelium, underscoring its feasibility as a living, green sensing material. This research lays the groundwork for innovative applications of mycelium in sustainable structural health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Growth of Highly Conductive PtSe2 Films Controlled by Raman Metrics for High-Frequency Photodetectors and Optoelectronic Mixers at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional PtSe2 exhibits outstanding intrinsic properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, broadband absorption and air stability, making it ideal for (opto)electronic applications. However, achieving films of high crystalline quality with controlled properties on low-cost and insulating substrates remains challenging. Here, highly crystalline semimetallic PtSe2 films are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on sapphire substrates. It is shown that a post-growth annealing remarkably improves the out-of-plane crystallinity and leads to record sheet conductances, up to 1.6 mS. In-depth structural analyses reveal the strong influence of the domain arrangement within the films on their sheet conductance. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the A1g Raman peak width, in addition to the commonly used Eg peak width, are both effective metrics for evaluating the quality of PtSe2: films with narrower Eg and A1g peaks exhibit higher in-plane and out-of-plane crystalline quality, as well as higher sheet conductance. Finally, coplanar waveguides integrating a semimetallic PtSe2 channel are fabricated on a 2-inch sapphire substrate to demonstrate optoelectronic devices operating at the 1.55 um telecom wavelength. This includes photodetectors with a record bandwidth of 60 GHz and the first PtSe2-based optoelectronic mixer with a 30 GHz bandwidth.</description>
