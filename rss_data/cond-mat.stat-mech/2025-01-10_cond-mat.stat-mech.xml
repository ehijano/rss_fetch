      <title>The effects of Repulsive Biquadratic Interactions in a Blume-Emery-Griffiths Spin-Glass with Competing, Attractive Biquadratic Cross-link Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A BEG Hamiltonian is used to model an Ising spin glass with annealed vacancies on a hierarchical lattice. In addition to competing bilinear interactions, repulsive biquadratic interactions on the perimeter of our unit structures compete with attractive cross-link interactions. Ordering and transitions in this system are probed by generating several phase diagrams, using renormalization group methods, for a range of constant K/J. A physical interpretation is offered for each sink corresponding to a bulk phase in phase space and critical exponents are calculated for the higher-order transitions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quasi-Periodically Driven Quantum Critical Systems: Analytical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study analytically the phase transitions in quasi-periodically driven one dimensional quantum critical systems that are described by conformal field theories (CFTs). The phase diagrams and phase transitions can be analytically obtained by using Avila's global theory in one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles. Compared to the previous works where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time and no phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup where the quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In our setup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and the phase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponents that determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analytically obtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is no phase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodically driven CFTs [1]. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of entanglement entropy on lattice models.</description>

      <title>Finite-Size Effects in Aging can be Interpreted as Sub-Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems brought out of equilibrium through a rapid quench from a disordered initial state into an ordered phase undergo physical aging in the form of phase-ordering kinetics, with characteristic dynamical scaling. In many systems, notably glasses, dynamical scaling is often described through sub-aging, where a phenomenological sub-aging exponent $0&lt;\mu&lt; 1$ is empirically chosen to achieve the best possible data collapse. Here it is shown that finite-size effects modify the dynamical scaling behavior, away from simple aging with $\mu=1$ towards $\mu&lt;1$, such that phenomenologically it would appear as sub-aging. This is exemplified for the exactly solved dynamical spherical model in dimensions $2&lt;d&lt;4$ and numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Ising model, with short-ranged and long-ranged interactions.</description>

      <title>Time Symmetries of Quantum Memory Improve Thermodynamic Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical computations inherently require energy dissipation that increases significantly as the reliability of the computation improves. This dissipation arises when transitions between memory states are not balanced by their time-reversed counterparts. While classical memories exhibit a discrete set of possible time-reversal symmetries, quantum memory offers a continuum. This continuum enables the design of quantum memories that minimize irreversibility. As a result, quantum memory reduces energy dissipation several orders of magnitude below classical memory.</description>

      <title>A Cold Tracer in a Hot Bath: In and Out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature overdamped tracer in a bath of Brownian particles. As the bath density is increased, the passive tracer transitions from an effectively active dynamics, characterized by boundary accumulation and ratchet currents, to a bona-fide equilibrium regime. To account for this, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom under the assumption of linear coupling to the tracer and show convergence to equilibrium in the large density limit. We then develop a perturbation theory to characterize the tracer's departure from equilibrium at large but finite bath densities, revealing an intermediate time-reversible yet non-Boltzmann regime, followed by a fully irreversible one. Finally, we show that when the bath particles are connected as a lattice, mimicking a gel, the cold tracer drives the entire bath out of equilibrium, leading to a long-ranged suppression of bath fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic active Brownian particle in two dimensions under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the dynamic behavior of an an-isotropic active Brownian particle under various stochastic resetting protocols in two dimensions. The motion of shape-asymmetric active Brownian particles in two dimensions leads to an-isotropic diffusion at short times, whereas rotational diffusion causes the transport to become isotropic at longer times. We have considered three different resetting protocols: (a) complete resetting, when both position and orientation are reset to their initial states, (b) only position is reset to its initial state, (c) only orientation is reset to its initial state. We reveal that orientation resetting sustains asymmetry even at late times. When both the spatial position and orientation are subject to resetting, a complex position probability distribution forms in the steady state. All the analytical findings are thoroughly validated by corresponding simulation results.</description>

      <title>Control Strategies for Maintaining Transport Symmetries Far From Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two schemes for controlling the transport dynamics of mesoscopic devices. In both approaches, we manipulate the system's output - such as particle currents and energy flows - while maintaining symmetric transport properties, even under far-from-equilibrium conditions. We provide exact descriptions of the modified processes under each scheme and investigate their characteristics. Notably, one of the schemes is shown to minimize the dissimilarity between the original and modified processes, as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These findings have the potential to enhance the design and control of mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Twisted times, the Schwarzian and its deformations in DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14238v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IR dynamics of SYK is that of the Schwarzian theory, the effective theory of broken reparametrization invariance. In the double scaling limit, SYK is completely solvable by chord diagrams, whose generating functional is a bilocal Liouville theory. At low temperatures a set of modes in this description becomes soft. We interpret them as reparametrization of some twisted time coordinates, and show explicitly that they lead to the nonlinear Schwarzian theory. We further consider deformations of the theory in the double scaling limit, giving rise to diagrams with multiple species of chords, and show that the generating functional is now a Liouville theory with multiple fields. These deformations can be tracked to the IR and we discuss how they affect the Schwarzian.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram, confining strings, and a new universality class in nematopolar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a minimal model of a system with coexisting nematic and polar orientational orders, where one field tends to order and the other prefers isotropy. For strong coupling, the ordered field aligns the isotropic one, locking their orientations. The phase diagram reveals three distinct phases--nematopolar (aligned orders), nematic (independent orders), and isotropic (vanishing orders)--separated by continuous and discontinuous transitions, including a triple and a tricritical point. We find unique critical scaling for the nematopolar-nematic transition, distinct from standard nematic or polar universality classes. Additionally, in the locked nematopolar phase, we show nematic $+1/2$ topological defect pairs are connected and confined by strings with constant tension. These strings arise from frustration in locking the orientational orders and can be interpreted as elongated cores of $+1$ polar topological defects. When a sufficiently strong background field couples to the polar order, all topological defects are expelled from the region. Analytical predictions are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Universal quasi-particle kinetics control the cell death decision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how fluctuations propagate across spatial scales is central to our understanding of inanimate matter from turbulence to critical phenomena. In contrast to physical systems, biological systems are organized into a hierarchy of processes on a discrete set of spatial scales: they are compartmentalized. Here, we show that dynamic compartmentalization of stochastic systems leads to emergent, quasi-particle-like kinetics which are used by cells to perform key biological functions. Specifically, we derive a general theory that predicts the emergence of a single degree of freedom irrespective of system specifics. We obtain equations of motion and response characterising its unique kinetic properties. We experimentally demonstrate the biological relevance of quasi-particle kinetics in the decision of cells to commit suicide (apoptosis). Using fluorescent microscopy, we show that the response of cells to apoptotic stimuli exhibits quasi-particle like kinetics which establish a low-pass filter for cellular stress signals. By highlighting that cells manipulate how noise and signals propagate across spatial scales, our work reveals a new mechanism of cell fate decision-making.</description>

      <title>Direct Sampling of Confined Polygons in Linear Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for sampling tightly confined random equilateral closed polygons in three-space which has runtime linear in the number of edges. Using symplectic geometry, sampling such polygons reduces to sampling a moment polytope, and in our confinement model this polytope turns out to be very natural from a combinatorial point of view. This connection to combinatorics yields both our fast sampling algorithm and explicit formulas for the expected distances of vertices to the origin. We use our algorithm to investigate the expected total curvature of confined polygons, leading to a very precise conjecture for the asymptotics of total curvature.</description>

      <title>Response Kinetic Uncertainty Relation for Markovian Open Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and kinetics of a nonequilibrium classical system fundamentally constrain the precision of an observable regarding the celebrated thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) and the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR). They have been extended to open quantum systems obeying the Lindblad master equation where unique quantum effects are identified. Recently, a new set of principles that further incorporate the response of a classical system to an external perturbation have been discovered, named the response TUR and the response KUR (R-KUR). In this work, we generalize the classical R-KUR using the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound to the steady state of the Lindblad master equation. The precision and the sensitivity of a measured observable are bounded from above by the conventional quantum dynamical activity and a perturbation-induced inter-subspace transition term. We provide sufficient conditions such that either of the two contributions vanishes, implying their equal importance. We verify our result and illustrate the conditions in an exactly solvable two-level atom.</description>

      <title>Magnetization reversal of finite-length Co and Fe atomic chains on Pt(332) surface: numerical calculations and a new theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different mechanisms of magnetization reversal in finite-length Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface have been investigated, taking into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It has been found that the magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors have been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposed theoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensional magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation and adsorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science to understand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larch\'{e}-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. {\bf 21} 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larch\'{e}-Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product $\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical potential $\mu$. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The reason is that volume strain is defined with respect to a fixed reference state. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity can be recovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional thermodynamic variable. This assigns a formal chemical potential $\nu$ to the immobile lattice sites. The difference $ G-\mu N $ can be identified with $\nu M$. We have worked this out for a one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The reinstated Gibbs-Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation. The derivative of population with respect to chemical potential at constant pressure and temperature is compared to the corresponding susceptibility in a fixed volume open system. We find that the difference is proportional to the elastic constant of the bare lattice, confirming that this quantity is the crucial macroscopic property distinguishing a solid under hydrostatic stress from a liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic resonance in molecular junctions driven by a periodically-varying external field. This is done using the time-dependent Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker formalism, which follows from exact analytical solutions to the Kadanoff-Baym equations describing the molecular junction subject to an arbitrary time-dependent bias. We focus on a double quantum dot nanojunction and compare the effects of the temperature with the fluctuating bias in the statically-driven case. We then consider the combined effect of AC-driving and white noise fluctuations on the rectified current through the nanojunction, and find a stochastic resonance effect, where at certain driving conditions the bias fluctuations enhance the current signal. The study is then extended to include the color noise in the applied bias, so that the combined effect of the color noise correlation time and driving frequency on stochastic resonance is investigated. We thereby demonstrate that photon-assisted transport can be optimized by a suitably tuned environment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Particle Collision Framework for Active Polar Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently dense intrinsically out-of-equilibrium suspensions, such as those observed in biological systems, can be modelled as active fluids characterised by their orientational symmetry. While mesoscale numerical approaches to active nematic fluids have been developed, polar fluids are simulated as either ensembles of microscopic self-propelled particles or continuous hydrodynamic-scale equations of motion. To better simulate active polar fluids in complex geometries or as a solvent for suspensions, mesoscale numerical approaches are needed. In this work, the coarse-graining Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) framework is applied to three active particle models to produce mesoscale simulations of polar active fluids. The first active-polar MPCD (AP-MPCD) is a variant of the Vicsek model, while the second and third variants allow the speed of the particles to relax towards a self-propulsion speed subject to Andersen and Langevin thermostats, respectively. Each of these AP-MPCD variants exhibit a flocking transition at a critical activity and banding in the vicinity of the transition point. We leverage the mesoscale nature of AP-MPCD to explore flocking in the presence of external fields, which destroys banding, and anisotropic obstacles, which act as a ratchet that biases the flocking direction. These results demonstrate the capacity of AP-MPCD to capture the known phenomenology of polar active suspensions, and its versatility to study active polar fluids in complex scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum cellular automata for one-dimensional chains of Fermionic modes and study their implementability as finite depth quantum circuits. Fermionic automata have been classified in terms of an index modulo circuits and the addition of ancillary systems. We strengthen this result removing the ancilla degrees of freedom in defining the equivalence classes. A complete characterization of nearest-neighbours automata is given. A class of Fermionic automata is found which cannot be expressed in terms of single mode and controlled-phase gates composed with shifts, as is the case for qubit cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Active Microrheology and Dynamic Phases for Pattern Forming Systems with Competing Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the driven dynamics of a probe particle moving through an assembly of particles with competing long-range repulsive and short-range attractive interactions, which form crystal, stripe, labyrinth, and bubble states as the ratio of attraction to repulsion is varied. We show that the probe particle exhibits a depinning-like threshold from an elastic regime, where the probe particle is trapped by interactions with the other particles, to a plastic flow regime, where the probe particle can break bonds in the surrounding medium. For a fixed particle density, the depinning threshold and sliding velocity of the probe particle vary nonmonotonically as the attraction term is increased. A velocity minimum appears near the crystal to stripe crossover, and there is a significant increase in the depinning threshold in the bubble regime when the probe particle is strongly confined inside the bubbles. For fixed attractive interaction but increasing particle density, the behavior is also nonmonotonic and there are jumps and drops in the velocity and depinning threshold corresponding to points at which the system transitions between different structures. There are also several distinct flow states that can be characterized by the amount of plastic deformation induced by the probe particle in the surrounding medium. Each flow state generates a different amount of effective drag on the probe particle, and there can be jumps in the velocity-force curve at transitions between the states. We also find that when oriented stripes are present, the probe particle can move along the stripe in an edge transport state that has a finite Hall angle.</description>

      <title>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent diffusion on pattern formation in a bounded habitat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a nonlocal version of the Fisher-KPP equation, we explore the impact of heterogeneous diffusion on pattern formation within a bounded region (refuge). Under homogeneous diffusion, it is established that, nonlocality can lead to spontaneous pattern formation under certain parameter conditions, otherwise, when the homogeneous state is stable, spatial perturbations such as the existence of a refuge (high quality region within a hostile environment) can induce patterns. To understand how density-dependent diffusivity influences these forms of pattern formation, we examine diffusivity reactions to both rarefaction or overcrowding. Additionally, for comparison, we investigate the scenario where diffusivity levels vary spatially, inside and outside the refuge. We find that state-dependent diffusivity affects the shape and stability of patterns, potentially triggering either explosive growth or fragmentation of the population distribution, depending on how diffusion responses to density changes.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation for repulsive-to-attractive interaction quench in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate exotic dynamics when the interactions are suddenly switched from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive, a procedure known to generate super-Tonks-Girardeau gases in systems with contact interactions. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the relaxed state exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the coherent (quantum) gas and the chaotic (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting analogous results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce a slower initial entropy growth. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Interferometry of quantum correlation functions to access quasiprobability distribution of work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, intimately connected with the quantum correlation function of two observables measured at distinct times, is becoming increasingly relevant for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. This quasiprobability distribution can take non-positive values, and its experimental reconstruction becomes challenging when expectation values of incompatible observables are involved. Here, we use an interferometric scheme aided by an auxiliary system to reconstruct the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution. We experimentally demonstrate this scheme in an electron-nuclear spin system associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. By measuring the characteristic function, we reconstruct the quasiprobability distribution of work and analyze the behavior of its first and second moments. Our results clarify the physical meaning of the work quasiprobability distribution in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Finally, we study the uncertainty of measuring the Hamiltonian of the system at two times, via the Robertson-Schr{\"o}dinger uncertainty relation, for different initial states.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Spectral Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that noisy quantum dynamics exposed to weak measurements exhibit a spectral transition between gapless and gapped phases. To this end, we employ the Lyapunov spectrum obtained through singular values of a non-unitary matrix describing the dynamics. We discover that the gapless and gapped phases respectively correspond to the volume-law and area-law phases of the entanglement entropy for the dominant Lyapunov vector. This correspondence between the spectral gap and the scaling of entanglement offers an intriguing analogy with ground-state phase transitions. We also discuss some crucial differences from ground-state transitions, such as the scaling law of the entanglement and the exponentially small gaps. Furthermore, we show that the spectral transition leads to the transition of the timescale for the memory loss of initial states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition: A perspective</title>

Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone &amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson &amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Modern Approach to 2D Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of these lecture notes is to introduce the modern approach to two-dimensional conformal field theory (2D CFT). The study of analytical methods in two-dimensional conformal field theory has developed over several decades, starting with BPZ. The development of analytical methods, particularly in rational conformal field theory (RCFT), has been remarkable, with complete classifications achieved for certain model groups. One motivation for studying CFT comes from its ability to describe quantum critical systems. Given that realistic quantum critical systems are fundamentally RCFTs, it is somewhat natural that the analytical methods of RCFT have evolved significantly.
  CFTs other than RCFTs are called irrational conformal field theories (ICFTs). Compared to RCFTs, the study of ICFTs has not progressed as much. Leaving aside whether there is physical motivation or not, ICFTs inherently possess a difficulty that makes them challenging to approach. However, with the development of quantum gravity, the advancement of analytical methods for ICFTs has become essential. The reason lies in the AdS/CFT correspondence. AdS/CFT refers to the relationship between $d+1$ dimensional quantum gravity and $d$ dimensional CFT. Within this correspondence, the CFT appears as a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity. Except in special cases, this CFT belongs to ICFT. Against this backdrop, the methods for ICFTs have developed rapidly in recent years. Many of these ICFT methods are indispensable for modern quantum gravity research. Unfortunately, these cannot be learned from textbooks on 2D CFTs, such as Yellow book. These lecture notes aim to fill this gap. Specifically, we will cover techniques that have already been applied in many studies, such as HHLL block and monodromy method, and significant results that have become proper nouns, such as Hellerman bound and HKS bound.</description>
