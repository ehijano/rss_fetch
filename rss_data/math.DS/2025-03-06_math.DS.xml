      <title>Finitary Ryan's and local $\mathcal{Q}$ entropy for $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the action of a group $G$ by homeomorphisms on a space $X$, the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(X,G)$ consists of all self-homeomorphisms of $X$ which commute with $x \mapsto g \cdot x$ for every $g \in G$. A theorem of Ryan shows that for an irreducible $\mathbb{Z}$-shift of finite type $(X,\sigma_{X})$, the center of $\mathrm{Aut}(X,\sigma_{X})$ is generated by the shift $\sigma_{X}$. A finitary version of this for $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts of finite type was proved by the second author for certain full shifts, and later generalized by Kopra to irreducible $\mathbb{Z}$-shifts of finite type. We generalize these finitary Ryan's theorems to shifts of finite type over more general groups. We prove that for contractible $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$-shifts of finite type with a fixed point, there is a finitely generated subgroup of the automorphism group whose centralizer in the group of homeomorphisms is the subgroup of shifts. We also prove versions of this for full shifts over any infinite, finitely generated group on sufficiently nice alphabet sizes.
  The stabilized automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}^{(\infty)}(X,G)$ is the union of $\mathrm{Aut}(X,H)$ over all finite index subgroups $H \subset G$. Aimed at studying stabilized automorphism groups for shifts of finite type, we introduce an entropy-like quantity for pointed groups which we call local $\mathcal{Q}$ entropy, a generalization of a notion called local $\mathcal{P}$ entropy previously introduced by the first author. Using the finitary Ryan's theorems, we prove that the local $\mathcal{Q}$ entropy of the stabilized automorphism group of a contractible $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$-shift of finite type recovers the topological entropy of the underlying shift system up to a rational multiple. We then use this to give a complete classification up to isomorphism of the stabilized automorphism groups of full shifts over $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant Hopf Links Near a Hamiltonian Equilibrium Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the existence of periodic orbits near an equilibrium point of a two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system. The equilibrium is supposed to be a nondegenerate minimum of the Hamiltonian. Every sphere-like component of the energy surface sufficiently close to the equilibrium contains at least two periodic orbits forming a Hopf link (A. Weinstein [19]). A theorem by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder [9] implies that there are either precisely two or infinitely many periodic orbits on such a component of the energy surface. This multiplicity result follows from the existence of a disk-like global surface of section. If a certain non-resonance condition on the rotation numbers of the orbits of the Hopf link is satisfied [8], then infinitely many periodic orbits follow. This paper aims to present explicit conditions on the Birkhoff-Gustavson normal forms of the Hamiltonian function at the equilibrium point that ensure the existence of infinitely many periodic orbits on the energy surface by checking the non-resonance condition as in [8] and not making use of any global surface of section. The main results focus on strongly resonant equilibrium points and apply to the Spatial Isosceles Three-Body Problem, Hill's Lunar Problem, and the H\'enon-Heiles System.</description>

      <title>Some contributions on Melnikov chaos for smooth and piecewise-smooth planar systems: "trajectories chaotic in the future"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a $2$-dimensional autonomous system subject to a $1$-periodic perturbation, i.e. $$ \dot{\vec{x}}=\vec{f}(\vec{x})+\epsilon\vec{g}(t,\vec{x},\epsilon),\quad \vec{x}\in\Omega .$$ We assume that for $\epsilon=0$ there is a trajectory $\vec{\gamma}(t)$ homoclinic to the origin which is a critical point: in this context Melnikov theory provides a sufficient condition for the insurgence of a chaotic pattern when $\epsilon \ne 0$.
  In this paper we show that for any line $\Xi$ transversal to $\{\vec{\gamma}(t) \mid t \in \mathbb{R} \}$ and any $\tau \in [0,1]$ we can find a set $\Sigma^+(\Xi,\tau)$ of initial conditions giving rise to a pattern chaotic just in the future, located in $\Xi$ at $t=\tau$. Further diam$(\Sigma^+(\Xi,\tau)) \le \epsilon^{(1+\nu)/ \underline{\sigma}}$ where $\underline{\sigma}&gt;0$ is a constant and $\nu&gt;0$ is a parameter that can be chosen as large as we wish.
  The same result holds true for the set $\Sigma^-(\Xi,\tau)$ of initial conditions giving rise to a pattern chaotic just in the past. In fact all the results are developed in a piecewise-smooth context, assuming that $\vec{0}$ lies on the discontinuity curve $\Omega^0$: we recall that in this setting chaos is not possible if we have sliding phenomena close to the origin. This paper can also be considered as the first part of the project to show the existence of classical chaotic phenomena when sliding close to the origin is not present.</description>

      <title>Visibility of heteroclinic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of stability has a long history in the field of dynamical systems: stable invariant objects are the ones that would be expected to be observed in experiments and numerical simulations. Heteroclinic networks are invariant objects in dynamical systems associated with intermittent cycling and switching behaviour, found in a range of applications. In this article, we note that the usual notions of stability, even those developed specifically for heteroclinic networks, do not provide all the information needed to determine the long-term behaviour of trajectories near heteroclinic networks. To complement the notion of stability, we introduce the concept of visibility, which pinpoints precisely the invariant objects that will be observed once transients have decayed. We illustrate our definitions with examples of heteroclinic networks from the literature.</description>

      <title>Measure of maximal entropy for minimal Anosov actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a minimal Anosov $\mathbb R^{\kappa}$-action on a closed manifold, we study the measure of maximal entropy constructed by Carrasco and Rodriguez-Hertz in \cite{CarHer} and show that it fits into the theory of Ruelle-Taylor resonances introduced by Guedes Bonthonneau, Guillarmou, Hilgert, and Weich in \cite{GBGHW}. More precisely, we show that the topological entropy corresponds to the first Ruelle-Taylor resonance for the action on a certain bundle of forms and that the measure of maximal entropy can be retrieved as the distributional product of the corresponding resonant and co-resonant states. As a consequence, we prove a Bowen-type formula for the measure of maximal entropy and a counting result on the number of periodic torii.</description>

      <title>An SIRS model with hospitalizations: economic impact by disease severity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-timescale SIRS-type model in which a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals experiences a severe course of the disease, requiring hospitalization. During hospitalization, these individuals do not contribute to further infections. We analyze the model's equilibria, perform a bifurcation analysis, and explore its two-timescale nature (using techniques from Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory). Our main result provides an explicit expression for the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the total number of hospitalized individuals for long times, revealing that this optimal fraction can be lower than 1. This highlights the interesting effect that a severe disease, by necessitating widespread hospitalization, can indirectly suppress contagions and, consequently, reduce hospitalizations. Numerical simulations illustrate the growth in the number of hospitalizations for short times. The model can also be interpreted as a scenario where only a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals develops symptoms and self-quarantines.</description>

      <title>There are not many periodic orbits in bunches for iteration of complex quadratic polynomials of one variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that for every complex quadratic polynomial $f$ with Cremer's fixed point $z_0$ (or periodic orbit)
  for every $\delta&gt;0$, there is at most one periodic orbit of minimal period $n$ for all $n$ large enough, entirely in the disc (ball) $B(z_0, \exp -\delta n)$ (at most two for a periodic Cremer orbit). Next, it is proved that the number of periodic orbits of period $n$ in a bunch $P_n$, that is for all $x,y\in P_n$, $|f^j(x)- f^j(y)|\le \exp -\delta n$
  for all $j=0,...,n-1$, does not exceed $\exp \delta n$. We conclude that the geometric pressure
  defined with the use of periodic points coincides with the one defined with the use of preimages of
  an arbitrary typical point. I. Binder, K. Makarov and S. Smirnov (Duke Math. J. 2003) proved this
  for all polynomials but assuming all periodic orbits are hyperbolic, and asked about general situations.
  We prove here a positive answer for all quadratic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Furstenberg entropy under ucp maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a tracial von Neumann algebra $(M,\tau)$, we prove that a state preserving $M$-bimodular ucp map between two stationary W$^*$-extensions of $(M,\tau)$ preserves the Furstenberg entropy if and only if it induces an isomorphism between the Radon-Nikodym factors. With a similar proof, we extend this result to quasi-factor maps between stationary spaces of locally compact groups and prove an entropy separation between unique stationary and amenable spaces. As applications, we use these results to establish rigidity phenomena for unique stationary Poisson boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result of Dal'Bo that the length spectrum of a non-elementary Fuchsian group is non-arithmetic, namely, it generates a dense additive subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$. In this note we observe the following extension of this fact: a non-elementary Fuchsian group contains two elements whose lengths are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>A mild rough Gronwall Lemma with applications to non-autonomous evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Gronwall type inequality for mild solutions of non-autonomous parabolic rough partial differential equations (RPDEs). This inequality together with an analysis of the Cameron-Martin space associated to the noise, allows us to obtain the existence of moments of all order for the solution of the corresponding RPDE and its Jacobian when the random input is given by a Gaussian Volterra process. Applying further the multiplicative ergodic theorem, these integrable bounds entail the existence of Lyapunov exponents for RPDEs. We illustrate these results for stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative boundary noise.</description>

      <title>Singular bifurcations in a modified Leslie-Gower model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a predator-prey system with a generalist Leslie-Gower predator, a functional Holling type II response, and a weak Allee effect on the prey. The prey's population often grows much faster than its predator, allowing us to introduce a small time scale parameter $\varepsilon$ that relates the growth rates of both species, giving rise to a slow-fast system. Zhu and Liu (2022) show that, in the case of the weak Allee effect, Hopf singular bifurcation, slow-fast canard cycles, relaxation oscillations, etc., exist. Our main contribution lies in the rigorous analysis of a degenerate scenario organized by a (degenerate) transcritical bifurcation. The key tool employed is the blow-up method that desingularizes the degenerate singularity. In addition, we determine the criticality of the singular Hopf bifurcation using recent intrinsic techniques that do not require a local normal form. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical bifurcation analysis, in which we numerically identify and analytically confirm the existence of a nearby Takens-Bogdanov point.</description>
