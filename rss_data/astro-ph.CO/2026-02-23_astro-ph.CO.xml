      <title>Pushing spectral siren cosmology into the third-generation era: a blinded mock data challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) spectral sirens offer a promising method for measuring cosmological parameters using GW data only - without relying on external redshift information such as electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs - by exploiting distributional features in the population of GW sources. The advent of third-generation detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will provide catalogs three orders of magnitudes larger than current ones, raising questions about the scalability and robustness of existing inference pipelines. We present a blinded mock data challenge that tests three public pipelines with distinct numerical implementations, namely, $\texttt{ICAROGW}$, $\texttt{CHIMERA}$, and $\texttt{pymcpop-gw}$, on simulated ET observations containing the best $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ binary black hole mergers that can be observed in 1 year. We assess their computational performance, validate their agreement in a blinded setting, and forecast cosmological constraints. We find that, thanks to GPU acceleration, these pipelines can process the events expected from ET within a manageable timeframe. All pipelines recover consistent cosmological and population parameters. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we measure $H(z)$ at $z\sim1.5$ with 2.4% precision, and achieve a mean precision on $H(z)$ of 2.8% across $0.7&lt;z&lt;1.8$ with a catalog of $\sim 12,000$ high-S/N events. This corresponds to joint constraints of $\sim 10%$ on $H_0$ and $\sim 26%$ on $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$. We also identify the events that contribute mostly to constraining cosmological parameters, showing that low-distance sources near population features drive the constraining power on all cosmological parameters, while higher-distance events primarily constrain $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$. Our results establish a validated, performance-tested framework for spectral siren cosmology in the era of third-generation GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Ly{\alpha} forest bounds on sterile neutrino production via neutrino self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range have long been considered a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we explore a sterile neutrino production mechanism through active neutrino self-interactions in the early universe, assuming that they constitute the full DM abundance. We implement a self-consistent treatment of the sterile-neutrino free streaming and the active-neutrino self-interactions on structure formation, which yield a unique scale-dependent modification to the linear matter power spectrum. We then set bounds on this scenario using a combination of the cosmic microwave background and Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints. Specifically, we utilize the two recent likelihoods derived from eBOSS data: (i) an effective field theory (EFT) based full-shape likelihood and (ii) a compressed likelihood obtained from the PRIYA-simulation emulator. We produce some of the most stringent observational constraints to date on sterile neutrino DM, comparable to the bounds from the most stringent laboratory constraints.</description>

      <title>First Dark Photon Search Results from the Dandelion Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first results from the Dandelion experiment, a directional detection, which searches for 1 meV dark photon dark matter. We use a spherical mirror to convert dark photons into standard millimeter-wavelength photons that can then be detected with an array of 221 Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) cooled down to 150 mK within the KISS (KIDs Interferometric Spectral Surveyor) camera and operating between 150 and 350 GHz. We used 1480 minutes of data to search for the signal of dark photons in the KID detectors, which is expected to be modulated due to the Earth's rotation. Our main challenge was to deal with a large background from room temperature and stray-light fluctuations. We used a de-correlation analysis to remove these background fluctuations. Templates of the background fluctuations were constructed from a Principal Component Analysis decomposition of detector measurements outside the expected Field of View trajectory of dark photons. We found that the dark photon signal was consistent with zero, giving a new upper limit on the dark photon's kinetic mixing, $\chi$, with masses between 0.6 meV and 1.4 meV. These are the first constraints on dark photons as a dark matter candidate using an array of KIDs at millimeter wavelength.</description>

      <title>CMB anisotropies from cosmic (super)strings in light of ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on cosmic string and superstring parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. The constraints are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses of the full \textit{Planck} temperature and polarization data combined with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6). For ordinary cosmic strings, we constrain the string tension $G\mu$, the string wiggliness parameter $\alpha$, and the self-chopping efficiency $\tilde{c}$. For cosmic superstrings, we constrain the fundamental string tension $G\mu_F$, the string coupling $g_s$, and a parameter $w$ describing the volume of the compact extra dimensions. In both cases, we find significantly tighter bounds on the string tension compared to previous analyses, obtaining $2\sigma$ upper limits of $G\mu &lt; 3.66\times10^{-8}$ and $G\mu_F &lt; 1.38\times10^{-8}$. We also discuss the significant prior-dependence of these results. The computational pipeline used in this work, including a modified version of \texttt{CAMB} capable of computing CMB anisotropies sourced by any active network described via unequal-time correlators, is released publicly as \texttt{CAMBactive} \cite{Raidal_CAMBactive_CAMB_extension_2026}.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Temperature-Dependent Interaction between Dark Matter and Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of the temperature-dependent interaction between dark matter (DM) and neutrinos on the measurement of cosmological parameters. We pay attention to the neutrino mass effects, so that the derivation of Boltzmann equations needs to specify the concrete form of interaction. We work in a model in which the DM-neutrino scatterings are induced by a dimension-six operator, and present the details for deriving the full Boltzmann hierarchy for DM and neutrinos, including a novel method to obtain the fluid approximation for modes entering the horizon. It is shown that our interaction can induce the dark acoustic oscillation in the DM-neutrino fluid, leaving distinct signatures on the CMB and matter power spectra. By using the latest CMB and BAO datasets from Planck, DESI and ACT, the constraint on today's DM-neutrino interaction parameter for the normal neutrino mass ordering reaches $u^0_{\chi-\nu} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-13})$, nearly nine orders stronger than that for temperature-independent case in the literature. This can be understood by noting that the scattering cross section increases nearly quadratically with cosmological temperature in the early universe, leading to enhanced effects. We have investigated alternative scenarios with different neutrino mass assumptions. In particular, models with degenerate neutrino masses give rise to weaker constraint of $u^0_{\chi-\nu} \lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-11})$, showing the importance to incorporate the realistic neutrino mass ordering in the fits. Finally, when employing the logarithmic flat prior for $u^0_{\chi-\nu}$, we have shown hints to a nonzero interaction at $95\%$ CL by combining Planck, DESI and ACT data.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dark Matter: Generalized Framework and Direct-Detection Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal electroweak dark matter models are compelling due to their simplicity, though calculations of their freezeout abundance are complicated by nonperturbative effects due to Sommerfeld enhancement and bound-state formation. It has been shown that all individual multiplet scenarios beyond the doublet lead to direct-detection signals above the neutrino floor and thus within the reach of next-generation experiments. If no signals are found, would minimal dark matter be excluded? Yes for the simplest models, but it has been unknown for the important extension of two multiplets coupled by Higgs interactions (Higgs-coupled minimal dark matter). We present a generalized framework for calculating nonperturbative effects for such models that also covers the case of individual multiplets. In this framework, we calculate nonperturbative effects on freezeout as well as the prospects for direct detection, correcting shortcomings and omissions in the literature. Importantly, for the mixed Majorana (odd) and Dirac (even) multiplet combinations 3M2D, 5M4D, and 7M6D, we find that the predicted direct-detection signals can extend below the neutrino floor. Fully testing minimal dark matter will thus require more than direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations across Galaxy Classification Schemes: I. Star Formation Rate-Stellar Mass Plane of CALIFA Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To gain deeper insights into galaxy evolution and the mechanisms driving transitions between different galaxy morphologies, we analyse the connection between star formation rate and stellar mass for 231 galaxies spanning Hubble types E1-Sdm from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Spectroscopy Area survey using three complementary classification schemes. The Hubble classification provides structural information, the circular velocity curve classification$-$based on principal component analysis$-$ traces the total gravitational potential, and the Quenching classification$-$derived from H$_{\alpha}$ equivalent width maps$-$indicates the spatial extent of quenched regions relative to star-forming areas. We find a clear separation of galaxy populations on the star formation rate-stellar mass plane. Late-type spirals with slow-rising circular velocity curves, represented by star-forming and quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, dominate the blue cloud. Early-type spirals with flat or round-peaked circular velocity curves belonging to centrally quiescent or mixed class populate the green valley, representing a transitional stage. Elliptical and lenticular galaxies with round- or sharp-peaked circular velocity curves from nearly retired or fully retired QSs reside on the red sequence. Furthermore, our results indicate that the morphological groups Sc-Scd, Sd-Sdm, and E1-E3 are characterized by a unique set of QSs and circular velocity curves, while galaxies with morphologies such as Sa-Sbc spread over multiple QSs and circular velocity curves. The distribution of the classification classes shows a tight link between galaxy structure, gravitational potential, and suppression of star-formation in the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Decay of a multi-axionic SU(N) symmetric color aether in the early Universe as an origin of emergence of a many-component dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new SU(N) symmetric model of interaction between the fields of four types: the multiplet of vector fields, which describes the so-called color aether, the multiplet of pseudoscalar fields, which is associated with the multi-component cosmic dark matter, the gauge and gravitational fields. The extended Lagrangian of the model contains a new constructive element, which is based on the covariant SU(N) symmetric divergence of the multiplet of vector fields; this new element, being the multiplet of scalars from the point of view of spacetime transformations and the color vector from the point of view of the SU(N) group space, gives us the possibility to formulate properly the multi-axionic extension of the Peccei-Quinn theory. The hypothesis of a spontaneous polarization of the multi-axionic color aether in the early Universe is presented. The set of self-consistent master equations of the model is derived. An application to cosmology is considered: the obtained master equations are solved for the truncated test model based on the Bianchi-I spacetime platform.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon mediated Inelastic Dark Matter in Cosmology, Astrophysics and Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic discussion of the phenomenology of Dark Photon iDM (A$^{\prime}$iDM) where the Standard Model (SM) is extended by a dark sector containing an additional $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry under which all SM particles are neutral, and that couples to the SM hypercharge gauge boson through a kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$. The model contains two Majorana states $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ with $\delta=M_{\chi_2}-M_{\chi_1}&gt;0$ and $\chi_1$ the dark matter candidate, and a dark photon $A^{\prime}$ with mass $M_{A^{\prime}}$. Our analysis represents an integration of existing ones, where only specific benchmarks of the A$^{\prime}$iDM scenario have been discussed. In particular, we fix the $U(1)_D$ coupling $\alpha_D$ equal to the electromagnetic one $\alpha_{EM}$ and $\epsilon$ to its experimental upper bound, and perform a complete scan of the remaining parameters $(M_{\chi_1},\delta, M_{A^{\prime}})$, discussing the $\chi_1$ relic abundance, its direct and indirect searches, as well as potential signals from astrophysics and accelerators. Our systematic scan shows that $\alpha_D$ = $\alpha_{EM}$ is not disfavored, as some previous analyses, limited to specific benchmarks, may suggest. We also find that when the $\chi_1$ relic density matches observation direct and indirect searches are not kinematically accessible. On the other hand we find that the projected luminosity of FASER, a detector searching for Long Lived Particles (LLP) decay at the LHC, can probe or rule out the parameters space of the model for $M_{\chi_1}\lesssim$ 7 GeV, 100 MeV $\lesssim \delta\lesssim$ 300 MeV and $M_{A^{\prime}}\lesssim$ 25 GeV. This range of parameter could be significantly extended by the FASER 2 upgrade proposed for the High-Luminosity phase at the LHC. The parameter space probed by LLP seaches partially overlaps with that probed by $\chi_1$ capture in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Single and double headed ORCs in the LOFAR surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep radio surveys are now producing catalogues with millions of radio sources. Radio sources can have complex morphologies that depend both on the production mechanisms and the local environment. Recently, an unusual class of circular radio sources have been identified that were named "odd radio circles" (ORC). They have sizes of about 1', a circular/elliptical shape and appear edge brightened. Subsequent observations have suggested that this class may comprise a variety of sources. Despite various attempts to explain these sources, their origin remains unclear. The main goal of this work is to increase the number of known ORCs and derive common characteristics that can help identify the origin of these sources. We searched the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data release 3 (DR3) at 144 MHz for ORCs using a combination of parameter filtering on catalogue entries and visual inspection. We then identified possible optical counterparts and derived information such as redshift, physical size, and spectral index using further radio data at 54 and 1400 MHz. We isolated 18 sources with ORC structures. Four of these are double headed ORCs (ORCs with two rings), and two are new discoveries. We also found 5 new single headed ORCs and 9 candidate ORCs. With this work we significantly expanded the population of known ORCs. Our findings confirms that ORCs are a rare and heterogenous population of radio sources. We confirm the association with large ellipticals in most cases and we note a relation between the ORCs physical size and their integrated spectral index with small ORCs avoiding steep spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>A spherical hydrodynamical model of cosmic voids in {\Lambda}CDM and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe.
  Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.</description>

      <title>New Interpretations of the Cosmological Preference for a Negative Neutrino Mass</title>

Abstract: Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) show some tension with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For one, the cosmological parameters determined by the CMB are at odds with the expansion history determined by latest BAO measurements. In addition, the combined data has placed uncomfortably strong constraints on neutrino mass. Both effects can be interpreted as negative neutrino mass, one describing the change to the expansion history and the other one describing enhanced lensing. In this paper, we show the current tensions can be solved with a single change either to the lensing of the CMB or the expansion of the universe. We show additional lensing could arise from a variety of models with new light fields. However, these models rarely give the same signal in temperature and polarization, giving a concrete test of the scenario. Alternatively, dark sector models can explain the changes to the expansion by changing the evolution of the matter density. These models introduce new forces, giving rise to long range signals in the three-point statistics of galaxies. We discuss a range of other examples which all illustrate the pattern that additional signals should appear if these tensions are explained by beyond the Standard Model physics.</description>

      <title>Comparing measures of the Hubble and BAO tensions in $\Lambda$CDM and possible solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test whether $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity theories can solve the Hubble tension consistently with DESI~DR2 BAO. We consider three $f(Q)$ functional forms: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We extend these models by allowing a cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible exponential, hyperbolic secant, and polynomial decay addition to the standard $\Lambda$CDM $H(z)$. We test these models against DESI~DR2 BAO, CMB (\emph{Planck}~2018 + SPT-3G + ACT~DR6), local $H_0$, and Cosmic Chronometer data. The logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent $f(Q)$ models do not provide an adequate solution, but the exponential model does. Furthermore, it slightly reduces the $(\Omega_m, H_0 r_d)$ parameter space tension between CMB and BAO datasets to $2.56\sigma$, down from $2.65\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Although $\Lambda$CDM faces only $1.66\sigma$ tension in DESI data space, the $1\sigma$ higher tension in parameter space suggests a real anomaly. The models assisted by the cosmological constant perform slightly better still, at the cost of undermined theoretical motivation. They also perform poorly once local $H_0$ measurements are included. The phenomenological models fit all data reasonably well, yet the best-fitting models predict isotropically averaged BAO distances exceeding the DESI~DR2 measurements at all redshifts. This highlights the difficulties of finding a theoretically motivated solution to the Hubble tension while remaining consistent with BAO data.</description>

      <title>Joint Constraints on Fuzzy and Warm Dark Matter from Satellite Populations of the Milky Way and Andromeda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a joint analysis of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) satellite populations to constrain the properties of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM). We combine MW satellite observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) with M31 satellite data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS), and model the corresponding observable satellite populations using the empirical galaxy--halo connection model described in Nadler et al. (2020) together with the appropriate selection functions. Uncertainties in the virial masses of the MW and M31 are incorporated through host-mass priors that linearly scale the relevant model parameters, allowing us to infer the full posterior distributions of all parameters. For the FDM case, we obtain $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (95\% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}} &gt; 1.42 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). For thermal-relic WDM, we find $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} &gt; 6.20~\mathrm{keV}$ (95\% CL) and $m_{\mathrm{WDM}} &gt; 5.75~\mathrm{keV}$ (20:1 posterior ratio). These results represent a moderate improvement over MW-only constraints, and provide the strongest constraints to date on the FDM and WDM derived from satellite galaxy populations in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL): Rubin-era photometric redshift stress-testing and at-scale production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates. RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community, including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$ characterization and assessment tools.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Electron Density Profile in Nearby Galaxies using SDSS MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most observational studies of galactic-scale magnetic fields using Faraday rotation rely on estimates of thermal electron densities in galaxies and their radial variations. However, the spatial distribution of electrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) is not clearly known. In this study, we propose and utilize collision-excited doublet emission line ratios of [S II] $\lambda\lambda$ 6716, 6731 $\r{A}$ to estimate the electron densities ($n_e$). To map their distribution in the galaxies, we employ IFU spectroscopic observations from the SDSS MaNGA survey, utilising data products from both the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We present a spatially resolved analysis of $66$ face-on galaxies (inclination, $i \leq 15^\circ$), including $46$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and $20$ Non-SFGs. Azimuthally averaged radial profiles of $n_e$ are obtained. We found that both SFGs and Non-SFGs exhibit $n_e$ gradients, with higher densities of $n_e$(S II) = $52.87 \pm 8.32$ cm$^{-3}$ and $99.39 \pm 24.37$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, in the inner disk region (r/R$_e$ $\leq$ 1.5), which decreases to $n_e$(S II) = $20.92 \pm 4.2$ cm$^{-3}$ in SFGs and $34.64 \pm 11.24$ cm$^{-3}$ in Non-SFGs, in the outer disk region (r/R$_e$ $&gt;$ 1.5). We have also analysed these sources with Pipe3D fluxes. We translated $n_e$ to electron column densities ($N_e$) by assuming a typical disk of thickness 1 kpc and note that $N_e \sim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ at $\sim$14 kpc in the disk outer region. We have also discussed the profiles obtained using [O II] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726, 3729 $\r{A}$ doublet. These electron density estimates at different radii provide valuable insights for resolving ambiguities in current and future studies of magnetic fields in galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Owl: Twin Active Collisional Ring Galaxies with Starburst Merging Front at $z=1.14$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing gas around galaxies, triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN), and stimulating star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting nearly identical morphologies. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a crucial mechanism for triggering intense starbursts in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole ringdown: The irreducible stochastic gravitational wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early Universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, for primordial black holes with masses exceeding $10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$, the associated stochastic background lies within the frequency range accessible to current and upcoming cosmic microwave background experiments, thereby providing a direct observational way to probe the existence of such extremely massive objects.</description>

      <title>No evidence for Keplerian taper of far-out galactic rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the 175 SPARC galactic rotation curves to test the hypothesis of whether the Keplerian velocity tapering at large radii ($V(r)\propto 1/\sqrt{r}$) germane to a convergent mass distribution in typical spherical halo models agrees with observational data. The null hypothesis is Rubin's flat-rotation curve, $V(r)=\text{constant}$ -such as can be obtained from a spherical, isothermal-like density profile, or alternatively with a very prolate halo-. To decide whether we adopt the null (Rubin behaviour) or alternative (Keplerian behaviour) hypothesis, we evaluate the derivative in each galaxy of $V(r)$ with its last data points. The test is model independent inasmuch we are testing for the \emph{slope} of the dark matter rotation curve, whether it is or not compatible with zero. We conclude that the data is presently compatible with the null hypothesis -no taper off, no decline of $V(r)$ is seen. Separately, beyond SPARC, our own Milky Way galaxy, for which recent data sets have been reported, does show clear $V(r)$ fall-off at the level of 20\%.</description>

      <title>Fast and Fewrious: Stochastic binary perturbations from fast compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive compact objects soften binaries. This process has been used for decades to constrain the population of such objects, particularly as a component of dark matter (DM). The effects of light compact objects, such as those in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected. In principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening them, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber velocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical for DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate induced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to zero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in the regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few fast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are measured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the constraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System. This opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to asteroid-mass DM candidates.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes swallow stellar objects at high rates: from Little Red Dots to Black Hole Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole growth plausibly occurs via runaway astrophysical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters that form intermediate mass black hole seeds at high redshifts. Such a model of Little Red Dots yields an order-of-magnitude higher rate of tidal disruption events than that of black hole captures. Our prediction, normalised to our proposed resolution of SMBH seeding, yields detectable TDE rates at high redshift. The resulting dense gas cocoons generate the nuclei of LRDs, each incorporating a central massive black-hole-star, with comparable masses in gas, stars, and massive black hole within a scale of around a parsec as inferred from the various spectral signatures.</description>
