      <title>On Obtaining New MUBs by Finding Points on Complete Intersection Varieties over $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) are closely connected with quantum physics, and the structure has a rich mathematical background. We provide equivalent criteria for extending a set of MUBs for $C^n$ by studying real points of a certain affine algebraic variety. This variety comes from the relations that determine the extendability of a system of MUBs. Finally, we show that some part of this variety gives rise to complete intersection domains. Further, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between MUBs and the maximal commuting classes (bases) of orthogonal normal matrices in $\mathcal M_n({\mathbb{C}})$. It means that for $m$ MUBs in $C^n$, there are $m$ commuting classes, each consisting of $n$ commuting orthogonal normal matrices and the existence of maximal commuting basis for $\mathcal M_n({\mathbb{C}})$ ensures the complete set of MUBs in $\mathcal M_n({\mathbb{C}})$.</description>

      <title>The Local Structure Theorem for Graph Minors with Finite Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Local Structure Theorem (LST) for graph minors roughly states that every $H$-minor free graph $G$ that contains a sufficiently large wall $W$, there is a set of few vertices $A$ such that, upon removing $A$, the resulting graph $G':=G - A$ admits an "almost embedding" $\delta$ into a surface $\Sigma$ in which $H$ does not embed. By almost embedding, we mean that there exists a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ whose vertex set is a subset of the vertex set of $G$ and an embedding of $\mathcal{H}$ in $\Sigma$ such that 1) the drawing of each hyperedge of $\mathcal{H}$ corresponds to a cell of $\delta$, 2) the boundary of each cell intersects only the vertices of the corresponding hyperedge, and 3) all remaining vertices and edges of $G'$ are drawn in the interior of cells. The cells corresponding to hyperedges of arity at least $4$, called vortices, are few in number and have small "depth", while a "large" part of the wall $W$ is drawn outside the vortices and is "grounded" in the embedding $\delta$. Now suppose that the subgraphs drawn inside each of the non-vortex cells are equipped with some finite index, i.e., each such cell is assigned a color from a finite set. We prove a version of the LST in which the set $C$ of colors assigned to the non-vortex cells exhibits "large" bidimensionality: The graph $G'$ contains a minor model of a large grid $\Gamma$ where each bag corresponding to a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, contains the subgraph drawn within a cell carrying color $\alpha$, for every color $\alpha \in C$. Moreover, the grid $\Gamma$ can be chosen in a way that is "well-connected" to the original wall $W$.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures in planar graphs: Induced Subgraphs, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial progress and weaker bounds are known, both conjectures remain unsolved. To shed further light on them, researchers have explored a variety of related notions and generalizations. In this paper, we clarify relations among several of these notions, most notably connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, and investigate the corresponding open problems. Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of plane triangulations of order $n$ whose connected domination number exceeds $n/3$. This construction gives a negative answer to a question of Bradshaw et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 36 (2022) 1416-1435], who asked whether the maxleaf number of every plane triangulation of order $n$ is at least $2n/3$. We also obtain new results on induced subgraphs with bounded treewidth and induced outerplanar subgraphs.</description>

      <title>An SDP Relaxation for the Sparse Integer Least Squares Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the \emph{sparse integer least squares problem} (SILS), an NP-hard variant of least squares with sparse $\{0, \pm 1\}$-vectors. We propose an $\ell_1$-based SDP relaxation, and a randomized algorithm for SILS, which computes feasible solutions with high probability with an asymptotic approximation ratio $1/T^2$ as long as the sparsity constant $\sigma \ll T$. Our algorithm handles large-scale problems, delivering high-quality approximate solutions for dimensions up to $d = 10,000$. The proposed randomized algorithm applies broadly to binary quadratic programs with a cardinality constraint, even for non-convex objectives. For fixed sparsity, we provide sufficient conditions for our SDP relaxation to solve SILS, meaning that any optimal solution to the SDP relaxation yields an optimal solution to SILS. The class of data input which guarantees that SDP solves SILS is broad enough to cover many cases in real-world applications, such as privacy preserving identification and multiuser detection. We validate these conditions in two application-specific cases: the \emph{feature extraction problem}, where our relaxation solves the problem for sub-Gaussian data with weak covariance conditions, and the \emph{integer sparse recovery problem}, where our relaxation solves the problem in both high and low coherence settings under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>The unstable formula theorem revisited via algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is about the surprising interaction of a foundational result from model theory, about stability of theories, with algorithmic stability in learning. First, in response to gaps in existing learning models, we introduce a new statistical learning model, called ``Probably Eventually Correct'' or PEC. We characterize Littlestone (stable) classes in terms of this model. As a corollary, Littlestone classes have frequent short definitions in a natural statistical sense. In order to obtain a characterization of Littlestone classes in terms of frequent definitions, we build an equivalence theorem highlighting what is common to many existing approximation algorithms, and to the new PEC. This is guided by an analogy to definability of types in model theory, but has its own character. Drawing on these theorems and on other recent work, we present a complete algorithmic analogue of Shelah's celebrated Unstable Formula Theorem, with algorithmic properties taking the place of the infinite.</description>

      <title>Hereditary First-Order Logic: the tractable quantifier prefix classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many computational problems can be modelled as the class of all finite structures $\mathbb A$ that satisfy a fixed first-order sentence $\phi$ hereditarily, i.e., we require that every (induced) substructure of $\mathbb A$ satisfies $\phi$. We call the corresponding computational problem the hereditary model checking problem for $\phi$, and denote it by Her$(\phi)$.
  We present a complete description of the quantifier prefixes for $\phi$ such that Her$(\phi)$ is in P; we show that for every other quantifier prefix there exists a formula $\phi$ with this prefix such that Her$(\phi)$ is coNP-complete. Specifically, we show that if $Q$ is of the form $\forall^\ast\exists\forall^\ast$ or of the form $\forall^\ast\exists^\ast$, then Her$(\phi)$ can be solved in polynomial time whenever the quantifier prefix of $\phi$ is $Q$. Otherwise, $Q$ contains $\exists \exists \forall$ or $\exists \forall \exists$ as a subword, and in this case, there is a first-order formula $\phi$ whose quantifier prefix is $Q$ and Her$(\phi)$ is coNP-complete. Moreover, we show that there is no algorithm that decides for a given first-order formula $\phi$ whether Her$(\phi)$ is in P (unless P$=$NP).</description>

      <title>Rainbow copies of spanning subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,p}^{[\kappa]}$ denote the space of $n$-vertex edge coloured graphs, where each edge occurs independently with probability $p$. The colour of each existing edge is chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $[\kappa]$. We consider the threshold for the existence of rainbow colored copies of a spanning subgraph $H$. We provide lower bounds on $p$ and $\kappa$ sufficient to prove the existence of such copies w.h.p.</description>
