      <title>Synthetic Controls with spillover effects: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative Synthetic Control Method is introduced in this study, a modification of the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) designed to improve its predictive performance by utilizing control units affected by the treatment in question. This method is then compared to other SCM modifications: SCM without any modifications, SCM after removing all spillover-affected units, Inclusive SCM, and the SP SCM model. For the comparison, Monte Carlo simulations are utilized, generating artificial datasets with known counterfactuals and comparing the predictive performance of the methods. Generally, the Inclusive SCM performed best in all settings and is relatively simple to implement. The Iterative SCM, introduced in this paper, was in close seconds, with a small difference in performance and a simpler implementation.</description>

      <title>Testing for an Explosive Bubble using High-Frequency Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a continuous-time stochastic volatility model with a linear drift, we develop a test for explosive behavior in financial asset prices at a low frequency when prices are sampled at a higher frequency. The test exploits the volatility information in the high-frequency data. The method consists of devolatizing log-asset price increments with realized volatility measures and performing a supremum-type recursive Dickey-Fuller test on the devolatized sample. The proposed test has a nuisance-parameter-free asymptotic distribution and is easy to implement. We study the size and power properties of the test in Monte Carlo simulations. A real-time date-stamping strategy based on the devolatized sample is proposed for the origination and conclusion dates of the explosive regime. Conditions under which the real-time date-stamping strategy is consistent are established. The test and the date-stamping strategy are applied to study explosive behavior in cryptocurrency and stock markets.</description>

      <title>Identifying and exploiting alpha in linear asset pricing models with strong, semi-strong, and latent factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The risk premia of traded factors are the sum of factor means and a parameter vector we denote by {\phi} which is identified from the cross section regression of alpha of individual securities on the vector of factor loadings. If phi is non-zero one can construct "phi-portfolios" which exploit the systematic components of non-zero alpha. We show that for known values of betas and when phi is non-zero there exist phi-portfolios that dominate mean-variance portfolios. The paper then proposes a two-step bias corrected estimator of phi and derives its asymptotic distribution allowing for idiosyncratic pricing errors, weak missing factors, and weak error cross-sectional dependence. Small sample results from extensive Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimator has the correct size with good power properties. The paper also provides an empirical application to a large number of U.S. securities with risk factors selected from a large number of potential risk factors according to their strength and constructs phi-portfolios and compares their Sharpe ratios to mean variance and S&amp;P 500 portfolio.</description>

      <title>Causal Effects in Matching Mechanisms with Strategically Reported Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing number of central authorities use assignment mechanisms to allocate students to schools in a way that reflects student preferences and school priorities. However, most real-world mechanisms incentivize students to strategically misreport their preferences. In this paper, we provide an approach for identifying the causal effects of school assignment on future outcomes that accounts for strategic misreporting. Misreporting may invalidate existing point-identification approaches, and we derive sharp bounds for causal effects that are robust to strategic behavior. Our approach applies to any mechanism as long as there exist placement scores and cutoffs that characterize that mechanism's allocation rule. We use data from a deferred acceptance mechanism that assigns students to more than 1,000 university-major combinations in Chile. Matching theory predicts that students' behavior in Chile should be strategic because they can list only up to eight options, and we find empirical evidence consistent with such behavior. Our bounds are informative enough to reveal significant heterogeneity in graduation success with respect to preferences and school assignment.</description>

      <title>Improved Semi-Parametric Bounds for Tail Probability and Expected Loss: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many management decisions involve accumulated random realizations for which the expected value and variance are assumed to be known. We revisit the tail behavior of such quantities when individual realizations are independent, and we develop new sharper bounds on the tail probability and expected linear loss. The underlying distribution is semi-parametric in the sense that it remains unrestricted other than the assumed mean and variance. Our bounds complement well-established results in the literature, including those based on aggregation, which often fail to take full account of independence and use less elegant proofs. New insights include a proof that in the non-identical case, the distributions attaining the bounds have the equal range property, and that the impact of each random variable on the expected value of the sum can be isolated using an extension of the Korkine identity. We show that the new bounds %not only complement the extant results but also open up abundant practical applications, including improved pricing of product bundles, more precise option pricing, more efficient insurance design, and better inventory management. For example, we establish a new solution to the optimal bundling problem, yielding a 17\% uplift in per-bundle profits, and a new solution to the inventory problem, yielding a 5.6\% cost reduction for a model with 20 retailers.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Order Flow and Market Impact with Bayesian Change-Point Detection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial order flow exhibits a remarkable level of persistence, wherein buy (sell) trades are often followed by subsequent buy (sell) trades over extended periods. This persistence can be attributed to the division and gradual execution of large orders. Consequently, distinct order flow regimes might emerge, which can be identified through suitable time series models applied to market data. In this paper, we propose the use of Bayesian online change-point detection (BOCPD) methods to identify regime shifts in real-time and enable online predictions of order flow and market impact. To enhance the effectiveness of our approach, we have developed a novel BOCPD method using a score-driven approach. This method accommodates temporal correlations and time-varying parameters within each regime. Through empirical application to NASDAQ data, we have found that: (i) Our newly proposed model demonstrates superior out-of-sample predictive performance compared to existing models that assume i.i.d. behavior within each regime; (ii) When examining the residuals, our model demonstrates good specification in terms of both distributional assumptions and temporal correlations; (iii) Within a given regime, the price dynamics exhibit a concave relationship with respect to time and volume, mirroring the characteristics of actual large orders; (iv) By incorporating regime information, our model produces more accurate online predictions of order flow and market impact compared to models that do not consider regimes.</description>
