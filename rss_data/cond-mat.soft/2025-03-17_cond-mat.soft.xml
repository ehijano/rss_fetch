      <title>Membrane Charge Effects on Solute Transport in Polyamide Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyamide membranes, such as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, are widely used for water desalination and purification. However, the mechanisms of solute transport and solute rejection due to charge interactions remain unclear at the molecular level. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine the transport of single-solute feeds through charged nanofiltration membranes with different membrane charge concentrations of COO$^{\text{-}}$ and NH$_2\!^+$ corresponding to different pH levels. Results show that Na$^+$ and Cl$^{\text{-}}$ solute ions are better rejected when the membrane has a higher concentration of negatively charged groups, corresponding to a higher pH, whereas CaCl$_2$ is well-rejected at all pH levels studied. These results are consistent with experimental findings which are performed at the same pH conditions as simulation setup. Moreover, solute transport behavior depends on the membrane functional group distribution. When COO$^{\text{-}}$ functional groups are concentrated at membrane feed surface, ion permeation into the membrane is reduced. Counter-ions tend to associate with charged functional groups while co-ions seem to pass by the charged groups more easily. In addition, steric effects play a role when ions of opposite charge cluster in pores of the membrane. This study reveals solute transport and rejection mechanisms related to membrane charge and provides insights into how membranes might be designed to achieve specific desired solute rejection.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Optimal Mixing via Defect-Vortex Coupling in Confined Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematic flows in two dimensions, largely driven by motile $+1/2$ disclinations, mix themselves efficiently and exhibit chaos in the bulk steady state. Motivated by recent experimental findings for three-defect braiding in cardioid-shaped domains, we investigate how this tendency toward chaotic fluid mixing can, counterintuitively, produce certain ordered, periodic flows in confinement with a controllable net topological charge. We study two-dimensional active nematics in systems with boundary conditions requiring a prescribed number of excess $+1/2$ disclinations, using Beris-Edwards nematohydrodynamics simulations, alongside an agent-based, hydrodynamic simulation approach. We find ordered flows for systems of three and four defects, and we use tools from braid theory to show that spontaneously occurring periodic defect motions produce maximal topological entropy. Our theory correctly predicts the generic absence of stable periodic orbits of more than four defects in strong confinement in simulation. Our results identify the parameter regime outside of which periodicity is lost, and allow us to probe the limits of topological entropy production.</description>

      <title>Predicting Magnetic Janus Particle Assembly with Differential Evolution Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Janus particles allow access to complex, nonlinear assembled structures that may enable interesting new magnetorheological (MR) fluids with uniquely engineered field responses. However, the overwhelming size of the parameter space for Janus and patchy particles makes exploration of such systems by experimental trial and error or through detailed simulation impractical. Here, a differential evolution (DE)-based simulation method is explored to predict the assembly of magnetic Janus particles as an alternative method for assembly prediction. Structure predictions from the DE simulation for laterally- and radially-shifted magnetic Janus particles are compared to four published experimental and simulation case studies. The DE simulation captures the orientation and structure of magnetic Janus particles for a range of shifts and a variety of external field conditions using the point dipole approximation. Structural predictions that rely on the reorganization of large clusters of particles were less well represented by the DE predictions. Despite this limitation, the DE simulation method can be used to predict key structural factors for magnetic Janus particle assemblies, as demonstrated by favorable comparison with three of the four model studies.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electrode Wettability to Optimize Nanobubble Nucleation and Reaction Rates in Electrochemical Gas-Evolving Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble formation in electrochemical system often hinders reaction efficiency by reducing active surface area and obstructing mass transfer, yet the mechanisms governing their nanoscale nucleation dynamics and impact remains unclear. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore nanobubble nucleation and reaction rates during water electrolysis on planar- and nano-electrodes, with systematically tuning electrode wettability through water-electrode and gas-electrode interactions. We identified distinct nucleation regimes: gas layers, surface nanobubbles, bulk nanobubbles, and no nanobubbles, and revealed a volcano-shaped relationship between wettability and reaction rate, where optimal wettability strikes a balance between suppressing bubbles and ensuring sufficient reactant availability to maximize performance. Nanoelectrodes consistently exhibit higher current densities compared to planar electrodes with the same wettability, due to pronounced edge effects. Furthermore, moderate driving forces enhance reaction rates without triggering surface bubble formation, while excessive driving forces induce surface nanobubble nucleation, leading to suppressed reaction rates and complex dynamics driven by bubble growth and detachment. These findings highlight the importance of fine-tuning wettability and reaction driving forces to optimize gas-evolving electrochemical systems at the nanoscale and underscore the need for multiscale simulation frameworks integrating atomic-scale reaction kinetics, nanoscale bubble nucleation, and microscale bubble dynamics to fully understand bubble behavior and its impact on performance.</description>

      <title>Growth Laws and Universality in 2-TIPS: Microscopic and Coarse grained approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two temperature induced phase separation(2-TIPS) is a phenomenon observed in mixtures of active and passive particles modeled by scalar activity where the temperature of the particle is proportional to its activity. The binary mixture of 'hot' and 'cold' particles phase separate when the relative temperature difference between hot and cold particles defined as activity $\chi$ exceeds a density dependent critical value. The study of kinetics in 2-TIPS, a non-equilibrium phase separation, is of fundamental importance in statistical physics. In this paper, we investigate 2-TIPS kinetics using molecular dynamics (MD) and coarse-grained (CG) modeling in 3D and 2D. The coarse-grained model couples two passive Model B equations for hot and cold particles, with coupling terms emulating the energy transfer between them by raising the temperature of cold particles and lowering that of hot particles, a key observation from the MD simulations. MD simulations reveal that at high densities, phase separation begins immediately after the quench, forming bi-continuous domains rich in hot or cold particles, similar to spinodal decomposition in passive systems. These interconnected domains are also observed in the coarse-grained model for the mixture's critical composition. Both MD and CG models show dynamic scaling of the correlation function, indicating self-similar domain growth. Regardless of dimensionality, both methods report algebraic growth in domain length with a growth exponent of $1/3$, known as the Lifshitz-Slyozov exponent, widely observed in passive systems. Our results demonstrate that the universality of phase separation kinetics observed in passive systems also extends to the non-equilibrium binary mixture undergoing 2-TIPS.</description>

      <title>Solubility and dissociation of ionic liquids in epoxides and cyclic carbonate by molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate emergency has led to the investigation of CO$_{2}$ valorization routes. A competitive process included in this framework is the catalytic CO$_{2}$ cycloaddition to epoxides, to produce cyclic carbonates. Halide-based Ionic liquids (ILs) have been postulated to be a competitive choice. Nevertheless, the structure-performance relation for different ILs is still a topic of debate, being the cation-anion dissociation constant a key descriptor. In this work, the ions effect is tackled by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Propylene oxide and carbonate force fields were tested and used for 1,2-epoxyhexane and hexylene carbonate force field construction, while ILs were modelled by the CL\&amp;P force field. Solubilities in an epoxide-carbonate medium were tested for ILs composed of [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] or [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cations combined with the halide anions: Iodide [$\mathrm{I^-}$], Bromide [$\mathrm{Br^-}$] and Chloride [$\mathrm{Cl^-}$]. Results showed that [$\mathrm{N2222^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids were insoluble in the epoxide/carbonate medium, whereas [$\mathrm{N4444^+}$] cation-based ionic liquids demonstrated diffusion. Reaction medium interactions were studied between key atoms for experimentally soluble ILs. It was found that cation-anion interaction follows the catalytic activity trend, being [$\mathrm{I^-}$] the halide anion less associated with ([$\mathrm{N4444^+}$], [$\mathrm{bmim^+}$] and [$\mathrm{emim^+}$]) cations. A correlation between the first peak integration of the radial distribution functions and the experimental yields (including [$\mathrm{N1111^+}$][$\mathrm{Br^-}$]) could be established with a regression coefficient of 0.86. Additionally, [$\mathrm{I^-}$] based ILs displayed a better interaction between the cation and the epoxide oxygen, phenomena linked to epoxide activation and intermediates stabilization.</description>

      <title>Toughness of double network hydrogels: the role of reduced stress propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.</description>

      <title>The stress tensor of dilute active colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stress tensor is calculated for dilute active suspensions composed of colloidal Janus particles propelled by self-diffusiophoresis and powered by a chemical reaction. The Janus particles are assumed to be spherical and made of catalytic and non-catalytic hemispheres. The chemical reaction taking place on the catalytic part of each Janus particle generates local molecular concentration gradients at the surface of the particle and, thus, an interfacial velocity slippage between the fluid and the solid particle, which is the propulsion mechanism of self-diffusiophoresis. In the dilute-system limit, the contributions of the suspended particles to the stress tensor are calculated by solving the chemohydrodynamic equations for the fluid velocity and the molecular concentrations around every Janus particle considered as isolated and far apart from each other. The results are the following. First, the well-known Einstein formula for the effective shear viscosity of colloidal suspensions is recovered, including the effect of a possible Navier slip length. Next, two further contributions are obtained, which depend on the molecular concentrations of the fuel and product species of the chemical reaction and on the orientation of the Janus particles. The second contribution is caused by simple diffusiophoresis, which already exists in passive suspensions with global concentration gradients and no reaction. The third contribution is due to the self-diffusiophoresis generated by the chemical reaction, which arises in active suspensions. The calculation gives quantitative predictions, which depend on the constitutive properties of the fluid and the fluid-solid interfaces, as well as on the geometry of the Janus particles.</description>

      <title>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active polymers respond to spatial activity gradients by autonomously migrating, a behavior central to biological self-organization and the design of intelligent synthetic materials. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structure and propulsion direction of tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs) determine their collective response to activity gradients. We show that TDAP assemblies exhibit strikingly different behaviors based on their organization: inward-directed arms form compact bundles that accumulate in low-activity regions, whereas outward-directed arms assemble into asters that undergo directed motion toward high-activity regions. Remarkably, mixed structures, comprising both inward- and outward-directed arms, display enhanced accumulation in the high-activity regions due to cooperative effects. Our results establish a fundamental link between polymer geometry and emergent transport, providing key design principles for programmable active materials.</description>

      <title>Perfect Stabilization of Biomolecular Adhesions under Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells attach to their environment by means of focal adhesions, which are molecular complexes that exhibit the remarkable ability to adapt to mechanical load by changing their size. Drawing from the biomolecular mechanisms underlying this behavior, we present a generic model for mechanically induced adhesion growth where conformational states of molecules already in the adhesion cluster are coupled to the adsorption of further molecules. For sufficiently strong coupling, an instability arises and unbounded system growth ensues in the absence of mechanical load. Unexpectedly, the same type of instability can lead to perfect stability under mechanical load, whereby adhesion clusters adjust their size to withstand arbitrarily large forces without breaking, a phenomenon we term perfect stabilization. We derive state diagrams that characterize adhesion stability under stationary loads and show that perfect stabilization also occurs under dynamic loading on physiologically relevant timescales. Finally, we show that perfect stabilization and related instabilities are generic phenomenona that can be realized in many different ways if internal molecule states are coupled to adsorption in nonequilibrium.</description>

      <title>Excitability and oscillations of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In living cells, cycles of formation and dissolution of liquid droplets can mediate biological functions such as DNA repair. However, the minimal physicochemical prerequisite for such droplet oscillations remains elusive. Here, we present a simple model composed of only two independent chemical components with their diffusive and chemical fluxes governed by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. There is turnover of fuel that maintains a chemical reaction away from equilibrium, leading to active droplets. We find that a single active droplet undergoes a pitchfork-bifurcation in the droplet volume upon increasing the fueling strength. Strikingly, the active droplet becomes excitable upon adding a further chemical reaction. For sufficient fueling, the system undergoes self-sustained oscillations cycling between droplet formation and dissolution. The minimal nature of our model suggests self-sustained active droplets as functional modules for de novo life.</description>

      <title>DNA Nanotechnology for Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance, first proposed by Dicke in 1954, is a highly efficient quantum light source that differs from conventional spontaneous emission. Unlike typical spontaneous emission, where intensity scales linearly with the number of electric dipoles, superradiance exhibits an intensity that scales quadratically with the number of electric dipoles. Similarly, the decay rate also increases proportionally to the dipole numbers. To realize superradiance, excited electric dipoles must be arranged in the same orientation with spacing much smaller than the wavelength of the excitation light. While previous studies have accidentally observed superradiance through the random aggregation of quantum dots and organic dyes, a deterministic approach for the materialization of superradiant has yet to be established. Herein, we (i) specifically outline the advantages of DNA nanotechnology in tackling this challenge, (ii) discuss the reasons why superradiance has not yet been realized even with the state-of-the art DNA nanotechnology, and (iii) propose potential solutions for overcoming the current limitations.</description>

      <title>Image Reconstruction from an Elastically Distorted Scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inverting the artifacts associated with scanning a page from an open book, i.e. "xeroxing." The process typically leads to a non-uniform combination of distortion, blurring and darkening owing to the fact that the page is bound to a stiff spine that causes the sheet of paper to be bent inhomogeneously. Complementing purely data-driven approaches, we use knowledge about the geometry and elasticity of the curved sheet to pose and solve a minimal physically consistent inverse problem to reconstruct the image. Our results rely on 3 dimensionless parameters, all of which can be measured for a scanner, and show that we can improve on the data-driven approaches. More broadly, our results might serve as a "textbook" example and a tutorial of how knowledge of generative mechanisms can speed up the solution of inverse problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in 3D printing technology now enable the precise positioning of microscopic material voxels to form complex structures. Combined with emerging multi-material capabilities and printable responsive materials, this opens new possibilities for digital composite materials and 3D printing of shape-transforming structures, or 4D printing. Building upon these advancements, we devise a novel methodology for crafting digitized 4D-printed shape-transforming sheets. We 3D print responsive sheets composed of two layers, each consisting of active and passive voxels meticulously positioned to form thin structures that can be actuated on demand. Our approach solves a long-standing problem in the field, i.e., the independent and simultaneous programming of lateral geometry and reference curvature. This unprecedented control over the resulting shape unlocks new opportunities in synthetic shape-morphing materials, with potential applications in programmable mechanical properties and multi-material systems.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>

Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Adaptive Force Chains in Reconfigurable Granular Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under an externally applied load, granular packings form force chains that depend on the contact network and moduli of the grains. In this work, we investigate packings of variable modulus (VM) particles, where we can direct force chains by changing the Young's modulus of individual particles within the packing on demand. Each VM particle is made of a silicone shell that encapsulates a core made of a low-melting-point metallic alloy (Field's metal). By sending an electric current through a co-located copper heater, the Field's metal internal to each particle can be melted via Joule heating, which softens the particle. As the particle cools to room temperature, the alloy solidifies and the particle recovers its original modulus. To optimize the mechanical response of granular packings containing both soft and stiff particles, we employ an evolutionary algorithm coupled with discrete element method simulations to predict the patterns of particle moduli that will yield specific force outputs on the assembly boundaries. The predicted patterns of particle moduli from the simulations were realized in experiments using 2D assemblies of VM particles and the force outputs on the assembly boundaries were measured using photoelastic techniques. These studies represent a step towards making robotic granular metamaterials that can dynamically adapt their mechanical properties in response to different environmental conditions or perform specific tasks on demand.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic flow field and frictional resistance coefficient of a disk rotating steadily in a compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity on a rigid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the hydrodynamics of a rotating disk in a two-dimensional compressible fluid layer with odd viscosity. Unlike conventional fluids, odd viscosity introduces a radial flow component that can be directed either inward or outward, depending on its sign. This phenomenon is expected to significantly impact the hydrodynamic interactions between two rotating disks, potentially causing effective attraction or repulsion depending on the sign of the odd viscosity and the direction of rotation. Furthermore, we calculate the rotational resistance coefficient and find that odd viscosity increases this coefficient, regardless of its sign.</description>
