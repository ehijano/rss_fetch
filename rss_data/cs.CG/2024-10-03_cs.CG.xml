      <title>Approximating Klee's Measure Problem and a Lower Bound for Union Volume Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Union volume estimation is a classical algorithmic problem. Given a family of objects $O_1,\ldots,O_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we want to approximate the volume of their union. In the special case where all objects are boxes (also known as hyperrectangles) this is known as Klee's measure problem. The state-of-the-art algorithm [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] for union volume estimation and Klee's measure problem in constant dimension $d$ computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation with constant success probability by using a total of $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries of the form (i) ask for the volume of $O_i$, (ii) sample a point uniformly at random from $O_i$, and (iii) query whether a given point is contained in $O_i$.
  We show that if one can only interact with the objects via the aforementioned three queries, the query complexity of [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] is indeed optimal, i.e., $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Our lower bound already holds for estimating the union of equiponderous axis-aligned polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and even if the algorithm is allowed to inspect the coordinates of the points sampled from the polygons, and still holds when a containment query can ask containment of an arbitrary (not sampled) point.
  Guided by the insights of the lower bound, we provide a more efficient approximation algorithm for Klee's measure problem improving the $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ time to $O((n+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}) \cdot \log^{O(d)}n)$. We achieve this improvement by exploiting the geometry of Klee's measure problem in various ways: (1) Since we have access to the boxes' coordinates, we can split the boxes into classes of boxes of similar shape. (2) Within each class, we show how to sample from the union of all boxes, by using orthogonal range searching. And (3) we exploit that boxes of different classes have small intersection, for most pairs of classes.</description>

      <title>ACEV: Unsupervised Intersecting Manifold Segmentation using Adaptation to Angular Change of Eigenvectors in Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intersecting manifold segmentation has been a focus of research, where individual manifolds, that intersect with other manifolds, are separated to discover their distinct properties. The proposed method is based on the intuition that when a manifold in $D$ dimensional space with an intrinsic dimension of $d$ intersects with another manifold, the data variance grows in more than $d$ directions. The proposed method measures local data variances and determines their vector directions. It counts the number of vectors with non-zero variance, which determines the manifold's intrinsic dimension. For detection of the intersection region, the method adapts to the changes in the angular gaps between the corresponding direction vectors of the child and parent using exponential moving averages using a tree structure construction. Accordingly, it includes those data points in the same manifold whose neighborhood is within the adaptive angular difference and eventually identifies the data points in the intersection area of manifolds. Data points whose inclusion in the neighborhood-identified data points increases their intrinsic dimensionality are removed based on data variance and distance. The proposed method performs better than 18 SOTA manifold segmentation methods in ARI and NMI scores over 14 real-world datasets with lesser time complexity and better stability.</description>

      <title>Recovering Manifold Structure Using Ollivier-Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ORC-ManL, a new algorithm to prune spurious edges from nearest neighbor graphs using a criterion based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature and estimated metric distortion. Our motivation comes from manifold learning: we show that when the data generating the nearest-neighbor graph consists of noisy samples from a low-dimensional manifold, edges that shortcut through the ambient space have more negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature than edges that lie along the data manifold. We demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative pruning methods and that it significantly improves performance on many downstream geometric data analysis tasks that use nearest neighbor graphs as input. Specifically, we evaluate on manifold learning, persistent homology, dimension estimation, and others. We also show that ORC-ManL can be used to improve clustering and manifold learning of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Finally, we provide empirical convergence experiments that support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>PROXI: Challenging the GNNs for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have transformed graph representation learning. In the widely adopted message-passing GNN framework, nodes refine their representations by aggregating information from neighboring nodes iteratively. While GNNs excel in various domains, recent theoretical studies have raised concerns about their capabilities. GNNs aim to address various graph-related tasks by utilizing such node representations, however, this one-size-fits-all approach proves suboptimal for diverse tasks.
  Motivated by these observations, we conduct empirical tests to compare the performance of current GNN models with more conventional and direct methods in link prediction tasks. Introducing our model, PROXI, which leverages proximity information of node pairs in both graph and attribute spaces, we find that standard machine learning (ML) models perform competitively, even outperforming cutting-edge GNN models when applied to these proximity metrics derived from node neighborhoods and attributes. This holds true across both homophilic and heterophilic networks, as well as small and large benchmark datasets, including those from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Moreover, we show that augmenting traditional GNNs with PROXI significantly boosts their link prediction performance. Our empirical findings corroborate the previously mentioned theoretical observations and imply that there exists ample room for enhancement in current GNN models to reach their potential.</description>

      <title>High-Order Continuous Geometrical Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a conservative algorithm to test the geometrical validity of simplicial (triangles, tetrahedra), tensor product (quadrilaterals, hexahedra), and mixed (prisms) elements of arbitrary polynomial order as they deform over a piecewise-linear trajectory.
  Our algorithm uses a combination of adaptive B\'ezier refinement and bisection search to determine if, when, and where the Jacobian determinant of an element's polynomial geometric map becomes negative in the transition from one configuration to another.
  Unlike previous approaches, our method preserves its properties also when implemented using floating point arithmetic: This feature comes at a small additional runtime cost compared to existing inexact methods, making it a drop-in replacement for current validity tests, while providing superior robustness and generality.
  To prove the practical effectiveness of our algorithm, we demonstrate its use in a high-order Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) elastodynamic simulator, and we experimentally show that it prevents invalid, simulation-breaking configurations that would otherwise occur using inexact methods, without the need for manual parameter tuning.</description>
