      <title>JESTR: Joint Embedding Space Technique for Ranking Candidate Molecules for the Annotation of Untargeted Metabolomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: A major challenge in metabolomics is annotation: assigning molecular structures to mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Despite recent advances in molecule-to-spectra and in spectra-to-molecular fingerprint prediction (FP), annotation rates remain low. Results: We introduce in this paper a novel paradigm (JESTR) for annotation. Unlike prior approaches that explicitly construct molecular fingerprints or spectra, JESTR leverages the insight that molecules and their corresponding spectra are views of the same data and effectively embeds their representations in a joint space. Candidate structures are ranked based on cosine similarity between the embeddings of query spectrum and each candidate. We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec and spec-to-FP annotation tools on three datasets. On average, for rank@[1-5], JESTR outperforms other tools by 23.6%-71.6%. We further demonstrate the strong value of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting rank@1 performance by 11.4% and enhancing the model's ability to discern between target and candidate molecules. Through JESTR, we offer a novel promising avenue towards accurate annotation, therefore unlocking valuable insights into the metabolome.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Molecular Design through Graph-based Topological Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of drug-like molecules is crucial for drug design. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often overlook structural information. However, feature engineering-based methods usually merely focus on binding affinity prediction without substantial molecular modification. To address this, we present Graph-based Topological Reinforcement Learning (GraphTRL), which integrates both chemical and structural data for improved molecular generation. GraphTRL leverages multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG) and persistent homology, combined with molecular fingerprints, as the state space for RL. Evaluations show that GraphTRL outperforms existing methods in binding affinity prediction, offering a promising approach to accelerate drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Entropic tug of war: Topological constraints spontaneously rectify the dynamics of a polymer with heterogeneous fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers with active segments constitute prospective future materials and are used as a model for some biological systems such as chromatin. The directions of the active forces are typically introduced with temporal or spatial correlations to establish directional motion of the chain and corresponding active dynamics. Instead, here we consider an active-passive copolymer, where the two segments differ only by the magnitude of their fluctuations and feature no artificial correlations. Here we show that although the model itself does not possess directional dynamics, if the chains are concentrated, directional persistent motion spontaneously arises as a consequence of the broken translational symmetry owing to the topological constraints. Using scaling arguments and simulations, we explain the phenomenon and describe the ensuing dynamics. Our work has thus far-reaching consequences for the mechanical properties of all dense active polymeric systems with heterogeneous fluctuations and in particular for chromatin conformation and dynamics that are crucial for biological functionality.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude compared to the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the downside of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular processes.</description>
