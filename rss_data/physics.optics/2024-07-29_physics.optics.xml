      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of a Linear Optical Cavity Driven On Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete framework of stochastic thermodynamics for a single-mode linear optical cavity driven on resonance. We first show that the steady-state intra-cavity field follows the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. The effective temperature is given by the noise variance, and the equilibration rate is the dissipation rate. Next we derive expressions for internal energy, work, heat, and free energy of light in a cavity, and formulate the first and second laws of thermodynamics for this system. We then analyze fluctuations in work and heat, and show that they obey universal statistical relations known as fluctuation theorems. Finite time corrections to the fluctuation theorems are also discussed. Additionally, we show that work fluctuations obey the Crook's Fluctuation theorem which is a paradigm for understanding emergent phenomena and estimating free energy differences. The significance of our results is two-fold. On one hand, our work positions optical cavities as a unique platform for fundamental studies of stochastic thermodynamics. On the other hand, our work paves the way for improving the energy efficiency and information processing capabilities of laser-driven optical resonators using a thermodynamics based prescription.</description>

      <title>Tunable Degenerate Optical Parametric Oscillation with Coupled Microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microresonator-based degenerate optical parametric oscillation (DOPO) has recently been explored as a compelling platform for all-optical computing and quantum information applications, such as truly random number generation and the production of squeezed states of light. Emerging research has highlighted the potential of coupled microresonators, or photonic molecules, as a novel avenue for spectral engineering, unlocking an extra degree of freedom for the optimization of four-wave mixing interactions. Here, we demonstrate DOPO within the coupled modes of a silicon nitride triple-state photonic molecule. Our design introduces a distinctive mechanism for spectral engineering, using microheaters to individually tune the resonance spectral positions, thus enabling dynamic local dispersion control within the coupled modes. We successfully generate a DOPO signal with active efficiency control and explore the optical mode spacing in the tens of gigahertz range to use native phase-locked optical pumps driven by a radio-frequency source.</description>

      <title>Panoramic single-pixel imaging with megapixel resolution based on rotational subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-pixel imaging (SPI) using a single-pixel detector is an unconventional imaging method, which has great application prospects in many fields to realize high-performance imaging. In especial, the recent proposed catadioptric panoramic ghost imaging (CPGI) extends the application potential of SPI to high-performance imaging at a wide field of view (FOV) with recent growing demands. However, the resolution of CPGI is limited by hardware parameters of the digital micromirror device (DMD), which may not meet ultrahigh-resolution panoramic imaging needs that require detailed information. Therefore, to overcome the resolution limitation of CPGI, we propose a panoramic SPI based on rotational subdivision (RSPSI). The key of the proposed RSPSI is to obtain the entire panoramic scene by the rotation-scanning with a rotating mirror tilted 45{\deg}, so that one single pattern that only covers one sub-Fov with a small FOV can complete a uninterrupted modulation on the entire panoramic FOV during a once-through pattern projection. Then, based on temporal resolution subdivision, images sequence of sub-Fovs subdivided from the entire panoramic FOV can be reconstructed with pixels-level or even subpixels-level horizontal shifting adjacently. Experimental results using a proof-of-concept setup show that the panoramic image can be obtained with 10428*543 of 5,662,404 pixels, which is more than 9.6 times higher than the resolution limit of the CPGI using the same DMD. To our best knowledge, the RSPSI is the first to achieve a megapixel resolution via SPI, which can provide potential applications in fields requiring the imaging with ultrahigh-resolution and wide FOV.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency broadband achromatic metalens in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metalenses have been extensively studied for their compact and flexible characteristics in focusing and imaging applications. However, it remains a significant challenge to design a broadband achromatic metalens that maintains high efficiency under arbitrary polarization incidence. In this work, we design a broadband achromatic metalens that achieves polarization-independent, high-efficiency focusing by effectively utilizing both co-polarization and cross-polarization components of the transmitted light. Using a minimalist anisotropic nanofin library, we optimize the phase distribution of the metalens at each designed wavelength with the particle swarm algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate a stable focal length with a deviation of less than 4$\%$ and an average focusing efficiency of 80.5$\%$ in the visible wavelength range of 450 to 650 nm. Moreover, we design a multi-wavelength off-axis bi-focal metalens to demonstrate the flexible control of output light phase and dispersion achieved by this method. The generality of this design enables its implementation in various metasurface devices, accelerating applications in broadband imaging and virtual/augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Enabling all-to-circular polarization upconversion by nonlinear chiral metasurfaces with rotational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a stacking strategy in designing chiral metasurfaces with high rotational symmetry, enabling quasi-bound-in-the-continuum (quasi-BIC) resonances characterized by absolute chirality. The rotational symmetry allows a circularly polarized pump to be converted into a circularly polarized nonlinear signal. Meanwhile, our bilayered metasurface can be engineered to respond solely to one selected circular polarization. Consequently, integrating resonant chiral response and rotational symmetry endows a unique category of metasurfaces to upconvert any linear or unpolarized pump into a circularly polarized nonlinear signal. Our results reveal that when such a metasurface is subjected to a linearly polarized pump, the intensity ratio of the resultant circularly polarized signals varies with the order of the nonlinear process. Counterintuitively, this ratio scales as the fourth power of the local field enhancement in the second harmonic process and the second power in the third harmonic process. Our work offers a comprehensive theoretical description of the nonlinear processes in chiral structures with rotation and provides universal guidelines for designing nonlinear all-dielectric metasurfaces with a strong chiral response.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-loss spiral resonators for precise LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swept laser interferometry is an extremely powerful solution embedded in several recent technologies such as absolute distance measurement, light detection and ranging, optical frequency domain reflectometry, optical coherence tomography, microresonator characterization, and gas spectroscopy. Nonlinearity in the optical frequency sweeping of tunable lasers is a fatal drawback in gaining the expected outcome from these technologies. Here, we introduce an onchip, millimeter scale, 7 m spiral resonator that is made of ultralow loss silicon nitride to act as a frequency ruler for correction of the tunable lasers sweeping nonlinearities. The sharp 2 MHz frequency lines of the 85 M high-quality resonator and the narrow spaced 25.57 MHz frequency ticks of the 7 m spiral allow unprecedented precise nonlinearity correction on an integrated photonics platform. Accurate measurements of the rulers frequency spacing, linewidth, and temperature and wavelength sensitivities of the frequency ticks are performed here to demonstrate the quality of the frequency ruler. In addition, the spiral resonator is implemented in an FMCW LiDAR experiment to demonstrate a potential application of the proposed onchip frequency ruler.</description>

      <title>Parachatnam-Berry Phase in Optics: Polarization Propagation in Helical Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parachatnam-Berry phase (PBP) is a geometric phase associated with the polarization of light propagating in optical systems. Here, we investigate the physical principles underlying the occurrence of PBP for a single-mode light beam propagating in a single-mode optical fiber with no significant stress-induced birefringence wound into a circular helix configuration. We discuss the effects of curvature and torsion of the helical fiber on the rotation of the polarization vector and the associated PBP. We find the analytic solution for the polarization vector and Stokes parameters of the light for any initial polarization state of the light entering the helical fiber, the analytic expression for the PBP of the light for periodic transport of the light, the intensity of a superposition of the initial and final beams which depends on the PBP, and we discuss the effects of fluctuations of the parameters specifying the geometry and the material characteristics of the helical fiber on the PBP. We also discuss the relationship between the PBP and the solid angle subtended by the tangent vector of the helix plotted on the unit sphere.</description>

      <title>Crater-shaped Enrichment of $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{Si}$ Color Centers in $4H$-SiC using Single-Pulse Near-Infrared Femtosecond Laser Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, Si vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{Si}$) color centers in SiC are of significant interest due to their potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum communication. Meanwhile, the qualities of laser-induced color centers are well guaranteed. Femtosecond laser processing suffices for increasing the yield of $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{Si}$ color centers in bulk materials and forms crater-shaped enriched regions on the surface. However, there is a notable absence of existing simulation methods to explain the mechanisms behind laser-assisted $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{Si}$ color center generation. In this work, we design a three-dimensional molecular dynamics (3D-MD) model using an integral hemi-ellipsoidal shell mathematical model to simulate the interaction of Gaussian laser beams with bulk materials. Furthermore, we calculate the transmittance, absorption coefficient, refractive index, and reflectivity of $4H$-SiC. Then, the absorptance of a 1030 nm laser in 350 {\mu}m-thick $4H$-SiC material is abtained to simulate the energy loss during the actual processing. Finally, the study analyzes the movement trajectories of $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{Si}$ color centers and explains the source of $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{Si}$ on the surface. This analysis explains the reasons for the enrichment of color centers in the crater-shaped regions formed after laser deposition. Our work provides an effective 3D-MD modeling approach to study the processing mechanisms of laser interaction with semiconductor materials, offering insights into efficient $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{Si}$ color center creation processes.</description>

      <title>Bistability in spatiotemporal mode-locking with dynamic multimode gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) dissipative soliton existed in spatiotemporal mode-locked (STML) multimode fiber laser has been demonstrated to be a promising formalism for generating high-energy femtosecond pulses, which unfortunately exhibit diverse spatiotemporal dynamics that have not been fully understood. Completely modeling the STML multimode fiber lasers can shed new light on the underlying physics of the spatiotemporal dynamics and thus better manipulate the generation of high-quality energic femtosecond pulses, which however is still largely unmet. To this end, here we theoretically investigate a dynamic multimode gain model of the STML multimode fiber laser by exploring the multimode rate equation (MMRE) in the framework of generalized multimode nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Using this dynamic multimode gain model, the attractor dissection theory is revisited to understand the dominant effects that determine the modal composition of 3D dissipative soliton. Specifically, by varying the numerical aperture of the multimode gain fiber (MMGF), different gain dynamics that correspond to distinct types of gain attractors are observed. As a result, two distinguishing STML operation regimes, respectively governed by the multimode gain effect and spatiotemporal saturable absorption, are identified. In the latter regime, especially, 3D dissipative solitons present bistability that there exist bifurcated solutions with two different linearly polarized (LP) mode compositions. To verify the theoretical findings, the experimental implementation shows that the state of STML can be switched between different LP modes, and confirms the presence of bistability. Particularly, the 3D-soliton shaping mechanism that is governed by the multimode gain effect is testified for the first time, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Perfect Hyperlens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of super-resolution lenses such as superlens and hyperlens, coupled with advancements in metamaterials, the diffraction limit of approximately half wavelength is no longer unbreakable. However, superlenses are easily affected by weak intrinsic losses and hyperlenses cannot achieve perfect imaging, significantly constraining their practical utility. To address these challenges, here we propose a perfect hyperlens based on the transformation optics. Importantly, perfect hyperlens is capable of self-focusing in geometrical optics while supporting propagating waves with exceptionally large wavenumbers, which endows it with key advantages such as ultra-high resolution, no aberration and strong robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the hyperbolic focusing performance in naturally in-plane hyperbolic polaritons of {\alpha}-MoO3 films numerically, which can be achieved by gradient thickness. The results greatly innovate the design principles of traditional imaging lens, providing many potentially significant applications for super-resolution real-time imaging, lithography, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Giant Purcell broadening and Lamb shift for DNA-assembled near-infrared quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the light emitted by individual molecules is instrumental to a number of novel nanotechnologies ranging from super-resolution bio-imaging and molecular sensing to quantum nanophotonics. Molecular emission can be tailored by modifying the local photonic environment, for example by precisely placing a single molecule inside a plasmonic nanocavity with the help of DNA origami. Here, using this scalable approach, we show that commercial fluorophores experience giant Purcell factors and Lamb shifts, reaching values on par with those recently reported in scanning tip experiments. Engineering of plasmonic modes enables cavity-mediated fluorescence far detuned from the zero-phonon-line (ZPL) - at detunings that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than the fluorescence linewidth of the bare emitter and reach into the near-infrared. Our results evidence a regime where the emission linewidth is dominated by the excited state lifetime, as required for indistinguishable photon emission, baring relevance to the development of nanoscale, ultrafast quantum light sources and to the quest toward single-molecule cavity-QED. In the future, this approach may also allow to design efficient quantum emitters at infrared wavelengths, where standard organic sources have a reduced performance.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on broadband absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of the optimal broadband absorption of waves in an open, dissipative system. We develop a general framework for absorption induced by multiple overlapping resonances, based on quasi-normal modes and radiative and non-radiative decay rates. Upper bounds on broadband absorption in a slab of thickness $d$ take the simple form: $A= 1-\exp(-F \alpha d)$, where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient and $F$ the path enhancement factor. We apply these results to sunlight absorption in photovoltaics and answer the long-standing debate on the best light-trapping strategy in solar cells. For angle-independent absorption, we derive the isotropic scattering upper bound $F = 4 n^2$ ($n$ the refractive index), extending the well-know Yablonovitch limit beyond the ray optics and weak absorption regimes. For angle-restricted illumination, we show that $F$ can be further increased up to $8 \pi n^2 / \sqrt{3}$ using multi-resonant absorption induced by periodical patterning. These results have a general scope in the field of wave physics and open new opportunities to maximize absorption, detection, and attenuation of electromagnetic or mechanical waves in ultrathin devices.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Comb Generation Via Cascaded Harmonic Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optical modulation of a continuous wave laser is a highly stable way to generate frequency combs, gaining popularity in telecommunication and spectroscopic applications. These combs are generated by modulating non-linear electro-optic crystals with radio frequencies, creating equally spaced side-bands centered around the single-frequency seed laser. Electro-optic frequency comb architectures often choose between optical bandwidth (cascaded GHz combs) or higher mode density (chirped RF generation). This work demonstrates an electro-optic frequency comb with &gt; 120 GHz of bandwidth and a 75 MHz repetition rate. The comb has three cascaded electro-optic modulators driven at sequentially lower harmonics, the last megahertz modulation dictating the repetition rate. This architecture can modulate at any individual harmonic and repetition rate without changes to the components. This comb can be used in any applications where a stable and tunable repetition rate is needed.</description>

Abstract: The similarity between the Schr\"odinger equation and the paraxial wave equation permits numerous analogies linking these fields, which is pivotal in advancing both quantum mechanics and wave optics. In this study, we demonstrate the application of operator techniques to an electromagnetic field characterized by the function $f(x + ay)$, leveraging the structural analogies between these equations.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Purcell effect can lead to a substantial enhancement in the maximum cooling power for solid-state laser cooling. We numerically demonstrate such enhancement in a patterned slot-waveguide structure using ytterbium-doped silica as the active material. The enhancement arises primarily from the increase of saturation power density and the escape efficiency, and can persist in spite of the presence of parasitic absorption in the structure surrounding the active material. Our results point to a new opportunity in photonic structure design for optical refrigeration.</description>

Abstract: Transient grating spectroscopy has become a mainstay among metal and semiconductor characterization techniques. Here we extend the technique towards the shortest achievable timescales by using tabletop high-harmonic generation of attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses that diffract from transient gratings generated with 500-1000 nm sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) pulses. We demonstrate the power of attosecond transient grating spectroscopy (ATGS) by investigating the ultrafast photoexcited dynamics in an Sb semimetal thin film. ATGS provides an element-specific, background-free signal, unfettered by spectral congestion, in contrast to transient absorption spectroscopy. With the ATGS measurements in Sb polycrystalline thin films, we observe the generation of coherent phonons and investigate the lattice and carrier dynamics. Among the latter processes, we extract carrier thermalization, hot carrier cooling, and electron-hole recombination, which are on the order of 20 fs, 50 fs, and 2 ps, timescales, respectively. Furthermore, simultaneous collection of transient absorption and transient grating data allows us to extract the total complex dielectric constant in the sample dynamics, including the real-valued refractive index, from which we are also able to investigate carrier-phonon interactions and longer-lived phonon dynamics. The outlined experimental technique expands the capabilities of transient grating spectroscopy and attosecond spectroscopies by providing a wealth of information concerning carrier and lattice dynamics with an element-selective technique, at the shortest achievable timescales.</description>

      <title>Directional coupling to a $\lambda/5000$ nano-waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-based micro-devices are considered promising candidates for consolidating several terahertz technologies into a common and practical platform. The practicality stems from the relatively low loss, device compactness, ease of fabrication, and wide range of available passive and active functionalities. Nevertheless, typical device footprints are limited by diffraction to several hundreds of micrometers, which hinders emerging nanoscale applications of terahertz frequencies. While metallic gap modes provide nanoscale terahertz confinement, efficiently coupling to them is difficult. Here we present and experimentally demonstrate a strategy for efficiently interfacing sub-terahertz radiation ({\lambda}=1 mm) to a waveguide formed by a nanogap, etched in a gold film, that is 200 nm ({\lambda}/5000) wide and up to 4.5 mm long. The design principle relies on phase matching dielectric and nanogap waveguide modes, resulting in efficient directional coupling between them when placed side-by-side. Broadband far field terahertz transmission experiments through the dielectric waveguide reveal a transmission dip near the designed wavelength due to resonant coupling. Near field measurements on the surface of the gold layer confirm that such a dip is accompanied by a transfer of power to the nanogap, with an estimated coupling efficiency of ~10%. Our approach provides a pathway for efficiently interfacing millimeter-wave and near-infrared photonic circuits, providing controlled and tailored nanoscale terahertz confinement, with important implications for on-chip nanospectroscopy, telecommunications, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Designing rotational motion of charges on plasmonic nanostructures excited by circularly polarized light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational motion of charges in plasmonic nanostructures plays an important role in transferring angular momentum between light and matter on the nanometer scale. Although sophisticated control of rotational charge motion has been achieved using spatially structured light, its extension to simultaneous excitation of the same charge motion in multiple nanostructures is not straightforward. In this study, we perform model calculations to show that spatially homogeneous circularly polarized (CP) light can excite rotational charge motions with a high degrees of freedom by exploiting the rotational symmetry of the plasmonic structure and that of the plasmon mode. Finite-difference time-domain simulations demonstrate selective excitation of rotational charge motion for both isolated nanoplates and periodic array structures, showing that complex charge rotations can be manipulated by plane CP waves in a wide range of plasmonic structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the achievement of 120W single-frequency narrow linewidth 1018nm laser based on wide-tunable DBR fiber seed source. The DBR structure seed source uses 8mm long doped optical fibers with a line width of 3.25k. The wavelength tuning range of this seed source exceeds 1.5 nm with the temperature range from 1{\deg}C to 95{\deg}C. The tuning wavelength and temperature show extremely high linearity, and there is no mode hopping during the tuning process. By adopting a multi-level fiber amplification structure, selecting appropriate doped fibers and optimizing their length, an output power exceeding 120W of 1018nm laser has been achieved. Measurement results indicate that the slope efficiency of the main amplification 77.3%, with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) suppression ratio greater than 60 dB. he output linewidth is 10.3 kHz, and the beam quality factor M2 is less than 1.3.</description>

      <title>Robust High-frequency Laser Phase Noise Suppression by Adaptive Pound-Drever-Hall Feedforward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppressing high-frequency laser phase noise, particularly at frequencies near and beyond typical feedback bandwidths of a few MHz, is a critical yet challenging task in many advanced applications. Feedforward-based methods generally outperform feedback in high-frequency range, but their performances are more susceptible to perturbations. In this work, we focus on the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)-feedforward method we demonstrated recently [Yu-Xin Chao et al., Optica 11(7), 945-950 (2024)] and analyze the factors that affect its long-term stability. By constructing a simple circuit allowing for adaptive control of the feedforward gain in response to power fluctuations of cavity transmission, we demonstrate a robust $\geq 40$~dB suppression of laser phase noise around 2~MHz and a noise suppression bandwidth up to 50~MHz. In comparison, when using normal PDH feedback, robust noise suppression of over 40 dB can only occur for frequencies below tens of kHz in most setups. Our findings may pave the way for general usage of PDH feedforward and allow for simple construction of low-noise lasers for precise quantum controls and precision metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentums (OAMs) of light can be categorized into longitudinal OAM (L-OAM) and transverse OAM (T-OAM). Light carrying time-varying L-OAM, known as self-torqued light, was recently discovered during harmonic generation and has been extensively developed within the context of optical frequency combs (OFCs). Meanwhile, ultrafast bursts of optical pulses, analogous to OFCs, are sought for various light-matter interaction, spectroscopic and nonlinear applications. However, achieving transiently switchable T-OAM of light on request, namely spatiotemporal vortex pulse bursts, with independently controlled spatiotemporal profile of each comb tooth, remain unrealized thus far. In this work, the experimental generation of spatiotemporal vortex bursts featured with controllable time-dependent characteristics is reported. The resultant bursts comprised of spatiotemporal optical vortex comb teeth have picosecond timescale switchable T-OAMs with defined arrangement, manifesting as spatiotemporal torquing of light. We also show ultrafast control of T-OAM chirality, yielding pulse bursts with staggered azimuthal local momentum density, resembling K\'arm\'an vortex streets. This approach enables the tailoring of more intricate spatiotemporal wavepacket bursts, such as high-purity modes variation in both radial and azimuthal quantum numbers of spatiotemporal Laguerre-Gaussian wavepackets over time, which may facilitate a host of novel applications in ultrafast light-mater interactions, high-dimensional quantum entanglements, space-time photonic topologies as well as spatiotemporal metrology and photography.</description>

      <title>A Polarimetric Wavefront Imager</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging both the polarization and the wavefront of a light beam is a complex task that typically demands several intensity acquisitions. Furthermore, sequential acquisition solutions are incompatible with the monitoring of ultra-fast processes. As a possible solution for single-shot wavefront and full-Stokes polarimetric imaging, we propose here a vector-beam lateral shearing interferometer. The device, composed of a patterned polarization-modulating Hartmann mask placed in the close vicinity of a camera, encodes all the information in the fringe pattern of a single image acquisition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric phase has historically been defined using closed cycles of polarization states, often derived using differential geometry on the Poincare sphere. Using the recently-developed wave model of geometric phase, we show that it is better to define geometric phase more generally, allowing every polarized wave to have a well-defined value at any point in its path. Using several example systems, we show how this approach provides more insight into the wave's behavior. Moreover, by tracking the continuous evolution of geometric phase as a wave propagates through an optical system, we encounter a natural explanation of why the conventional Poincare sphere solid angle method uses geodesic paths rather than physical paths of the polarization state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, which constitute an extension of the dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. A salient feature of plasmonic time crystals is their ability to support amplification of both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that such systems support collective resonances of longitudinal modes, independently of the wave vector $k$. These resonances originate from the interaction between the positive and negative frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system, and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance occurs at a modulation frequency of $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, associated with a direct inter-band transition. Higher-order resonances are associated with related mechanisms but at lower modulation frequencies. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles, and also provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the limit of weak modulation amplitude, in the absence of losses. Our findings offer insights into using time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of reflection zeros of optical differentiators based on layered metal-dielectric-metal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of reflection zeros of three-layer structures consisting of a dielectric layer sandwiched between two metal layers, which can be used as optical differentiators. We show that the reflection zeros possess non-zero topological charges, which makes them topologically protected. With a small perturbation of the parameters of the structure (e.g., a change in one of the layer thicknesses), the reflection zero does not disappear, but shifts in the parameter space, i.e., appears at different wavelength and angle of incidence. We demonstrate that with a further parameter change, two zeros with opposite topological charges (+1 and -1) approach each other, merge, and then disappear. We believe that the obtained results give useful insight regarding the operation of layered metal-dielectric-metal structures possessing reflection zeros.</description>

      <title>Inherent spin-orbit locking in topological bound state in the continuum lasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are exotic optical topological singularities that defy the typical radiation within the continuum of radiative modes and carry topological polarization vortices in momentum space. Enabling ultrahigh quality factors, BICs have been applied in realizing lasing and Bose-Einstein condensation via micro-/nano- photonic structures, and their momentum-space vortex topologies have been exploited in passive systems, revealing novel spin-orbit photonic effects. However, as representative topological properties, the spin-orbit-related phenemona of BICs in active systems have not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrate the inherent spin-orbit locking in topological BIC lasing. Utilizing photonic crystal (PhC) slabs with square (C4v) and triangular (C6v) lattices, we achieve distinct spin-orbit locking combinations in topological BIC lasing of +1 and -2 topological charges. These BIC lasing profiles manifest as vortex and high-order anti-vortex polarization configurations, directly tied to the topological properties of BICs. Our experimental results directly reveal the spin-orbit locking phenomena through momentum-space spin-dependent self-interference patterns and real-space spin separations of the lasing emissions. This study not only highlights the inherent spin-orbit-locking behaviours of topological BIC lasing but also opens new possibilities for dynamically switchable orbital angular momentum (OAM) lasing by controlling photonic spin, presenting significant potential for advancements in topological photonic source applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) advantageously combine excellent photophysical properties with a potential for integration in highly compact devices. Progress towards scalable integration necessitates a high quantum efficiency and an efficient photon collection. In this context, we compare the optical characteristics of individual hBN color centers generated by electron irradiation, in two different electromagnetic environments. We keep track of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after dry transfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar structures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition to improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D materials or in planar photonic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a high-sensitivity, rapid, and low-cost method for methane sensing based on a nonlinear interferometer. This method utilizes signal photons generated by stimulated parametric down-conversion (ST-PDC), enabling the use of a silicon detector to capture high-precision methane absorption spectra in the mid-infrared region. By controlling the system loss, we achieve more significant changes in visibility, thereby increasing sensitivity. The methane concentration within a gas cell is determined accurately. In addition, ST-PDC enables long-distance sensing and the capability to measure low ambient methane concentrations in the real world. A low-cost CMOS camera is employed to capture spatial interference fringes, ensuring fast and efficient detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognized as a potential resource for quantum technologies and a possible testbed for fundamental physics, the control and preparation of nonclassical states of mechanical oscillators has been explored extensively. Within optomechanics, quantum state synthesis can be realized by entangling photonic and phononic degrees of freedom followed by optical detection. Single-photon detection enables one of the most powerful forms of such heralded quantum state preparation, permitting the creation of single phonon states when applied to conventional cavity optomechanical systems. As the complexity of optomechanical systems increases, single-photon detection may provide heralded access to a larger class of exotic quantum states. Here, we examine the quantum dynamics of optomechanical systems that permit forward Brillouin scattering, where a single phonon mode mediates transitions between a collection of equally spaced optical resonances. Solving both the Schrodinger equation and the Lindblad master equation for this system, we find that initial states comprised of single photons or weak laser pulses evolve into complex quantum states where the frequency of single photon states and the phonon occupation number are entangled. Physically, these interactions permit a single photon to scatter to lower frequencies, where phonon excitation occurs for each scattering event. Combining this result with frequency filtering, we show how single-photon detection can herald selected multi-phonon Fock states, even in the presence of optical losses. We also present an approach for quantum tomography of the heralded phonon states.</description>

Abstract: We present magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) spectrometer based on a modified Martin-Puplett interferometer, utilizing continuous wave sub-THz low-power radiation in broad frequency range. This spectrometer is capable of measuring the frequency dependence of the MOKE response function, both the Kerr rotation and ellipticity, simultaneously with sub-milliradian accuracy without the need for reference measurement. The instrument's versatility allow it to be coupled to a cryostat with optical windows enabling studies of a variety of quantum materials such as unconventional superconductors, two-dimensional electron gas systems, quantum magnets, and other system showing optical Hall response, at sub-Kelvin temperatures and in high magnetic fields. We demonstrate the functionality of the MOKE spectrometer using an undoped InSb wafer as a test sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Airy wave packet is a solution to the potential-free Schrodinger equation that exhibits remarkable properties such as self-acceleration, non-diffraction, and self-healing. Although Airy beams are now routinely realized with electromagnetic waves and electrons, the implementation with neutrons has remained elusive due to small transverse coherence lengths, low fluence rates, and the absence of neutron lenses. In this work, we overcome these challenges through a holographic approach and present the first experimental demonstration of neutron Airy beams. The presented techniques pave the way for fundamental physics studies with Airy beams of non-elementary particles, the development of novel neutron optics components, and the realization of neutron Airy-vortex beams.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional solitons supported by the spin-orbit coupling and Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in PT-symmetric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited states (ESs) of two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons of the semivortex (SV) and mixed-mode (MM) types, supported by the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and local nonlinearity in binary Bose-Einstein condensates, are unstable, on the contrary to the stability of the SV and MM solitons in their fundamental states. We propose a stabilization strategy for these states in 3D, combining SOC and long-range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions (RRI), in the presence of a spatially-periodic potential, that may include a parity-time (PT)-symmetric component. ESs of the SV solitons, which carry integer vorticities S and S+1 in their two components, exhibit robustness up to S= 4. ESs of MM solitons feature an interwoven necklace-like structure, with the components carrying opposite fractional values of the orbital angular momentum. Regions of the effective stability of the 3D solitons of the SV and MM types (both fundamental ones and ESs), are identified as functions of the imaginary component of the PT-symmetric potential and strengths of the SOC and RRI terms.</description>

Abstract: The curves of zero intensity of a complex optical field can form knots and links: optical vortex knots. Both theoretical constructions and experiments have so far been restricted to the very small families of torus knots or lemniscate knots. Here we describe a mathematical construction that presumably allows us to generate optical vortices in the shape of any given knot or link. We support this claim by producing for every knot $K$ in the knot table up to 8 crossings a complex field $\Psi:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies the paraxial wave equation and whose zeros have a connected component in the shape of $K$. These fields thus describe optical beams in the paraxial regime with knotted optical vortices that go far beyond previously known examples.</description>

      <title>A Semi-definite Optimization Method for Maximizing the Shared Band Gap of Topological Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic crystals (PCs) can support robust edge modes to transport electromagnetic energy in an efficient manner. Such edge modes are the eigenmodes of the PDE operator for a joint optical structure formed by connecting together two photonic crystals with distinct topological invariants, and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are located in the shared band gap of two individual photonic crystals. This work is concerned with maximizing the shared band gap of two photonic crystals with different topological features in order to increase the bandwidth of the edge modes. We develop a semi-definite optimization framework for the underlying optimal design problem, which enables efficient update of dielectric functions at each time step while respecting symmetry constraints and, when necessary, the constraints on topological invariants. At each iteration, we perform sensitivity analysis of the band gap function and the topological invariant constraint function to linearize the optimization problem and solve a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem efficiently. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is superior in generating optimized optical structures with robust edge modes.</description>

      <title>Requirements on bit resolution in optical Ising machine implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Ising machines have emerged as a promising dynamical hardware solver for computational hard optimization problems. These Ising machines typically require an optical modulator to represent the analog spin variables of these problems. However, modern day optical modulators have a relatively low modulation resolution. We therefore investigate how the low bit-resolution of optical hardware influences the performance of this type of novel computing platform. Based on numerical simulations, we determine the minimum required bit-resolution of an optical Ising machine for different benchmark problems of different sizes. Our study shows that a limited bit-resolution of 8bit is sufficient for the optical modulator. Surprisingly, we also observe that the use of a 1bit-resolution modulator significantly improves the performance of the Ising machine across all considered benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Polarization state control for high peak power applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous applications in the extreme field science are possible with circularly polarized high peak power ultrashort pulses. Commonly used quarter wave plates are not applicable here, while multi-mirror schemes are very complicated. We showed that the simple PET film $\approx$20 $\mu$m thick can be used to control the polarization state of the high peak power beam and achieve ellipticity of $\approx$0.8 with negligible nonlinear phase distortion. The film can withstand $10^3$ shots at intensity of $I = 3 \cdot 10^{12}$ W/cm$^2$ without visible damage. Thus, for a PW laser system and beam diameter of 20 cm the PET film can be used for quite a long time. We proved this experimentally using 1 TW femtosecond Ti:Sa laser measuring the angular distribution of the second harmonic from the plasma channel created in an undercritical gas plume.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear behavior of Raman Linewidth of 1-3 Layer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Raman spectroscopy of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been conducted. However, only a small portion of those studies note the full width half maximum (FWHM) of these 2D materials. FWHM is an indicator of phonon dispersions in 2D materials. In addition, it is a critical parameter that can denote the quality of the given 2D material, which is directly related to its engineering performance for manufactured devices. In this study, we analyze the effect that temperature has on the FWHM of the E2g1 mode for WSe2. We also analyze this temperature dependent trend for WSe2 with different thicknesses: monolayer (1L), bilayer (2L), and triple-layer (3L). The results show a different trend associated with each thickness on temperature dependence analysis for WSe2. The 1L WSe2 shows a parabolic trend with increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the 2L shows a steady linear trend with increasing temperature. On the other hand, FWHM for 3L WSe2 can be fitted by a simplified Klemens model, which explains its non-linear behavior.</description>

      <title>Molecular Strong Coupling and Cavity Finesse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular strong coupling offers exciting prospects in physics, chemistry and materials science. Whilst attention has been focused on developing realistic models for the molecular systems, the important role played by the entire photonic mode structure of the optical cavities has been less explored. We show that the effectiveness of molecular strong coupling may be critically dependent on cavity finesse. Specifically we only see emission associated with a dispersive lower polariton for cavities with sufficient finesse. By developing an analytical model of cavity photoluminescence in a multimode structure we clarify the role of finite-finesse in polariton formation, and show that lowering the finesse reduces the extent of the mixing of light and matter in polariton states. We suggest that the detailed nature of the photonic modes supported by a cavity will be as important in developing a coherent framework for molecular strong coupling as the inclusion of realistic molecular models.</description>

      <title>Applications of Bound States in the Continuum in Photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted attention in photonics owing to their interesting properties. For example, BICs can effectively confine light in a counter-intuitive way and the far-field radiation of photonic structures that exhibit BICs manifests fascinating topological characteristics. Early research into photonic BICs was primarily focused on designing artificial structures to produce BICs. However, since the mid-2010s, exploring the potential applications of BICs has been a growing trend in research. In this Review, we detail the unique properties of BICs, including the ability to achieve enhanced light confinement, sharp Fano resonances, and topological characteristics. We also explore phenomena derived from BICs including the generation of circularly polarized states and unidirectional guided resonances and the impact of BICs on various applications such as lasing, nonlinear frequency conversion, waveguiding, sensing and wavefront control. We also discuss the insights provided by BICs in several emerging research frontiers, such as parity-time symmetric systems, higher-order topology, exciton-photon coupling, and moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Deep Learning and Phase Change Materials for Four-state Broadband Multifunctional Metasurfaces in the Visible Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we report, for the first time, broadband multifunctional metasurfaces with more than four distinct functionalities. The constituent meta-atoms combine two different phase change materials, $\mathrm{VO_2}$ and $\mathrm{Sb_2S_3}$ in a multi-stage configuration. FDTD simulations demonstrate a broadband reflection amplitude switching between the four states in visible range due to the enhanced cavity length modulation effect from the cascaded Fabry-Perot cavities, overcoming the inherent small optical contrast between the phase change material (PCM) states. This, along with the reflection phase control between the four states, allows us to incorporate both amplitude and phase-dependent properties in the same metasurface - achromatic deflection, wavelength beam splitting, achromatic focusing, and broadband absorption, overcoming the limitations of previous functionality switching mechanisms for the visible band. We have used a Tandem Neural network-based inverse design scheme to ensure the stringent requirements of different states are realized. We have used two forward networks for predicting the reflection amplitude and phase for a meta-atom within the pre-defined design space. The excellent prediction capability of these surrogate models is utilized to train the reverse network. The inverse design network, trained with a labeled data set, is capable of producing the optimized meta-units given the desired figure-of-merits in terms of reflection amplitude and phase for the four states. The optical characteristics of two inverse-designed metasurfaces have been evaluated as test cases for two different sets of design parameters in the four states. Both structures demonstrate the four desired broadband functionalities while closely matching the design requirements, suggesting their potential in visible-range portable medical imaging devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction Utilizing the Topological Faraday Effect of Topological Insulator Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. So far, the transduction efficiency $\eta$ via the magneto-optic Faraday effect (i.e., the light-magnon interaction) in the ferromagnet YIG has been demonstrated to be small as $\eta\sim 10^{-8} \mathrm{-} 10^{-15}$ due to the weak magneto-optic coupling. Here, we take advantage of the fact that three-dimensional topological insulator thin films exhibit a topological Faraday effect that is independent of the sample thickness in the terahertz regime. This leads to a large Faraday rotation angle and therefore enhanced light-magnon interaction in the thin film limit. We show theoretically that the transduction efficiency between microwave and terahertz photons can be greatly improved to $\eta\sim10^{-4}$ by utilizing the heterostructures consisting of topological insulator thin films such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and ferromagnetic insulator thin films such as YIG.</description>

      <title>Long-lived collective Rydberg excitations in atomic gas achieved via ac-Stark lattice modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>

Abstract: We report numerical studies of microwave bianisotropies by magnetochiral (MCh) metasurfaces consisting of double Z-type gammadions with perpendicularly magnetized substrates. The metasurfaces' effective polarizability tensor, extracted from calculated reflection and transmission coefficients, has components of the non-reciprocal moving-type bianisotropy as well as the reciprocal chiral-type bianisotropy and non-reciprocal magneto-optical (MO) effect. Combination of the metasurfaces with contraposition MCh metasurfaces cancels both the chiral-type bianisotropy and MO effect, resulting in pure moving optical media. Achieved perfect transmission with phase difference of $\pi$ realizes an ideal gyrator for arbitrary spatial and polarization modes.</description>

      <title>General protocols for the efficient distillation of indistinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce state-of-the-art protocols to distill indistinguishable photons, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, while using a modest amount of resources scaling only linearly in $n$. Our resource requirements are both significantly lower and have fewer hardware requirements than previous works, making large-scale distillation experimentally feasible for the first time. This efficient reduction of distinguishability error rates has direct applications to fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computation, potentially leading to improved thresholds for photon loss errors and allowing smaller code distances, thus reducing overall resource costs. Our protocols are based on Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, special cases of which include the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard matrices. This general perspective allows us to unify previous results on distillation protocols and introduce a large family of efficient schemes. We utilize the rich mathematical structure of Fourier transforms, including symmetries and related suppression laws, to quantify the performance of these distillation protocols both analytically and numerically. Finally, our work resolves an open question concerning suppression laws for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform: the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</description>
