      <title>Automated Market Makers: A Stochastic Optimization Approach for Profitable Liquidity Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentrated liquidity automated market makers (AMMs), such as Uniswap v3, enable liquidity providers (LPs) to earn liquidity rewards by depositing tokens into liquidity pools. However, LPs often face significant financial losses driven by poorly selected liquidity provision intervals and high costs associated with frequent liquidity reallocation. To support LPs in achieving more profitable liquidity concentration, we developed a tractable stochastic optimization problem that can be used to compute optimal liquidity provision intervals for profitable liquidity provision. The developed problem accounts for the relationships between liquidity rewards, divergence loss, and reallocation costs. By formalizing optimal liquidity provision as a tractable stochastic optimization problem, we support a better understanding of the relationship between liquidity rewards, divergence loss, and reallocation costs. Moreover, the stochastic optimization problem offers a foundation for more profitable liquidity concentration.</description>

      <title>Risk measures based on target risk profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem that classical risk measures may not detect the tail risk adequately. This can occur for instance due to averaging when calculating the Expected Shortfall. The current literature proposes the so-called adjusted Expected Shortfall as a solution. This risk measure is the supremum of Expected Shortfalls for all possible levels, adjusted with a function $g$, the so-called target risk profile. We generalize this idea by using a family of risk measures which allows for more choices than Expected Shortfalls, leading to the concept of adjusted risk measures. An adjusted risk measure quantifies the minimal amount of capital that has to added to a financial position $X$ to ensure that each risk measure out of the chosen family is smaller or equal to the target risk profile $g(p)$ for the corresponding level $p\in[0,1]$. We discuss a variety of assumptions such that desirable properties for risk measures are satisfied in this setup. From a theoretical point of view, our main contribution is the analysis of equivalent assumptions such that an adjusted risk measure is positive homogeneous and subadditive. Furthermore, we show that these conditions hold for several adjusted risk measures beyond the adjusted Expected Shortfall. In addition, we derive their dual representations. Finally, we test the performance in a case study based on the S$\&amp;$P $500$.</description>

      <title>Asian Basket Spread Options: A New Approximation Based on Stochastic Taylor Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present closed analytical approximations for the pricing of Asian basket spread options under the Black-Scholes model. The formulae are obtained by using a stochastic Taylor expansion around a log-normal proxy model and are found to be highly accurate for Asian and spread options in practice. Unlike other approaches, they do not require any numerical integration or root solving.</description>
