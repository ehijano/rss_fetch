      <title>ORS: A novel Olive Ridley Survival inspired Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-heuristic algorithmic development has been a thrust area of research since its inception. In this paper, a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Olive Ridley Survival (ORS), is proposed which is inspired from survival challenges faced by hatchlings of Olive Ridley sea turtle. A major fact about survival of Olive Ridley reveals that out of one thousand Olive Ridley hatchlings which emerge from nest, only one survive at sea due to various environmental and other factors. This fact acts as the backbone for developing the proposed algorithm. The algorithm has two major phases: hatchlings survival through environmental factors and impact of movement trajectory on its survival. The phases are mathematically modelled and implemented along with suitable input representation and fitness function. The algorithm is analysed theoretically. To validate the algorithm, fourteen mathematical benchmark functions from standard CEC test suites are evaluated and statistically tested. Also, to study the efficacy of ORS on recent complex benchmark functions, ten benchmark functions of CEC-06-2019 are evaluated. Further, three well-known engineering problems are solved by ORS and compared with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics. Simulation results show that in many cases, the proposed ORS algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The sub-optimal behavior of ORS in some recent benchmark functions is also observed.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Parameter Tractability of the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm on Random Planted Vertex Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first parameterized analysis of a standard (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm on a distribution of vertex cover problems. We show that if the planted cover is at most logarithmic, restarting the (1+1) EA every $O(n \log n)$ steps will find a cover at least as small as the planted cover in polynomial time for sufficiently dense random graphs $p &gt; 0.71$. For superlogarithmic planted covers, we prove that the (1+1) EA finds a solution in fixed-parameter tractable time in expectation.
  We complement these theoretical investigations with a number of computational experiments that highlight the interplay between planted cover size, graph density and runtime.</description>

      <title>Y-Drop: A Conductance based Dropout for fully connected layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Y-Drop, a regularization method that biases the dropout algorithm towards dropping more important neurons with higher probability. The backbone of our approach is neuron conductance, an interpretable measure of neuron importance that calculates the contribution of each neuron towards the end-to-end mapping of the network. We investigate the impact of the uniform dropout selection criterion on performance by assigning higher dropout probability to the more important units. We show that forcing the network to solve the task at hand in the absence of its important units yields a strong regularization effect. Further analysis indicates that Y-Drop yields solutions where more neurons are important, i.e have high conductance, and yields robust networks. In our experiments we show that the regularization effect of Y-Drop scales better than vanilla dropout w.r.t. the architecture size and consistently yields superior performance over multiple datasets and architecture combinations, with little tuning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Biological Neuronal Correlations with Quantum Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding of how biological neural networks process information is one of the biggest open scientific questions of our time. Advances in machine learning and artificial neural networks have enabled the modeling of neuronal behavior, but classical models often require a large number of parameters, complicating interpretability. Quantum computing offers an alternative approach through quantum machine learning, which can achieve efficient training with fewer parameters. In this work, we introduce a quantum generative model framework for generating synthetic data that captures the spatial and temporal correlations of biological neuronal activity. Our model demonstrates the ability to achieve reliable outcomes with fewer trainable parameters compared to classical methods. These findings highlight the potential of quantum generative models to provide new tools for modeling and understanding neuronal behavior, offering a promising avenue for future research in neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression with a Learned Concept Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for symbolic regression (SR), the task of searching for compact programmatic hypotheses that best explain a dataset. The problem is commonly solved using genetic algorithms; we show that we can enhance such methods by inducing a library of abstract textual concepts. Our algorithm, called LaSR, uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM) to discover and evolve concepts occurring in known high-performing hypotheses. We discover new hypotheses using a mix of standard evolutionary steps and LLM-guided steps (obtained through zero-shot LLM queries) conditioned on discovered concepts. Once discovered, hypotheses are used in a new round of concept abstraction and evolution. We validate LaSR on the Feynman equations, a popular SR benchmark, as well as a set of synthetic tasks. On these benchmarks, LaSR substantially outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art SR approaches based on deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we show that LaSR can be used to discover a novel and powerful scaling law for LLMs.</description>

      <title>TX-Gen: Multi-Objective Optimization for Sparse Counterfactual Explanations for Time-Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In time-series classification, understanding model decisions is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.</description>

      <title>COSCO: A Sharpness-Aware Training Framework for Few-shot Multivariate Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series classification is an important task with widespread domains of applications. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series classification. However, they often require large expert-labeled training datasets which can be infeasible in practice. In few-shot settings, i.e. only a limited number of samples per class are available in training data, DNNs show a significant drop in testing accuracy and poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose to address these problems from an optimization and a loss function perspective. Specifically, we propose a new learning framework named COSCO consisting of a sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) optimization and a Prototypical loss function to improve the generalization ability of DNN for multivariate time series classification problems under few-shot setting. Our experiments demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/JRB9/COSCO.</description>

      <title>SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of neural networks to perform robotic perception and control tasks such as depth and optical flow estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and automatic control has led to their widespread adoption in recent years. Deep Reinforcement Learning has been used extensively in these settings, as it does not have the unsustainable training costs associated with supervised learning. However, DeepRL suffers from poor sample efficiency, i.e., it requires a large number of environmental interactions to converge to an acceptable solution. Modern RL algorithms such as Deep Q Learning and Soft Actor-Critic attempt to remedy this shortcoming but can not provide the explainability required in applications such as autonomous robotics. Humans intuitively understand the long-time-horizon sequential tasks common in robotics. Properly using such intuition can make RL policies more explainable while enhancing their sample efficiency. In this work, we propose SHIRE, a novel framework for encoding human intuition using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and using it in the Deep RL training pipeline to enhance sample efficiency. Our framework achieves 25-78% sample efficiency gains across the environments we evaluate at negligible overhead cost. Additionally, by teaching RL agents the encoded elementary behavior, SHIRE enhances policy explainability. A real-world demonstration further highlights the efficacy of policies trained using our framework.</description>

      <title>Steinmetz Neural Networks for Complex-Valued Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, leverages multi-view learning to construct more interpretable representations within the latent space. Subsequently, we present the Analytic Neural Network, which implements a consistency penalty that encourages analytic signal representations in the Steinmetz neural network's latent space. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship between the real and imaginary components. Utilizing an information-theoretic construction, we demonstrate that the upper bound on the generalization error posited by the analytic neural network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performance and robustness to additive noise, afforded by our proposed networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficacy of Instance Incremental vs. Batch Learning in Delayed Label Environments: An Empirical Study on Tabular Data Streaming for Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world tabular learning production scenarios typically involve evolving data streams, where data arrives continuously and its distribution may change over time. In such a setting, most studies in the literature regarding supervised learning favor the use of instance incremental algorithms due to their ability to adapt to changes in the data distribution. Another significant reason for choosing these algorithms is \textit{avoid storing observations in memory} as commonly done in batch incremental settings. However, the design of instance incremental algorithms often assumes immediate availability of labels, which is an optimistic assumption. In many real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection or credit scoring, labels may be delayed. Consequently, batch incremental algorithms are widely used in many real-world tasks. This raises an important question: "In delayed settings, is instance incremental learning the best option regarding predictive performance and computational efficiency?" Unfortunately, this question has not been studied in depth, probably due to the scarcity of real datasets containing delayed information. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation and analysis of this question using a real-world fraud detection problem and commonly used generated datasets. Our findings indicate that instance incremental learning is not the superior option, considering on one side state-of-the-art models such as Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) and other side batch learning models such as XGBoost. Additionally, when considering the interpretability of the learning systems, batch incremental solutions tend to be favored.

      <title>NeuroLGP-SM: Scalable Surrogate-Assisted Neuroevolution for Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) play a crucial role in the architectural configuration and training of Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a process known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is hindered by its inherent computational expense, requiring multiple generations, a large population, and numerous epochs. The most computationally intensive aspect lies in evaluating the fitness function of a single candidate solution. To address this challenge, we employ Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs). While a few SAEAs approaches have been proposed in neuroevolution, none have been applied to truly large DNNs due to issues like intractable information usage. In this work, drawing inspiration from Genetic Programming semantics, we use phenotypic distance vectors, outputted from DNNs, alongside Kriging Partial Least Squares (KPLS), an approach that is effective in handling these large vectors, making them suitable for search. Our proposed approach, named Neuro-Linear Genetic Programming surrogate model (NeuroLGP-SM), efficiently and accurately estimates DNN fitness without the need for complete evaluations. NeuroLGP-SM demonstrates competitive or superior results compared to 12 other methods, including NeuroLGP without SM, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and autoencoders. Additionally, it is worth noting that NeuroLGP-SM is 25% more energy-efficient than its NeuroLGP counterpart. This efficiency advantage adds to the overall appeal of our proposed NeuroLGP-SM in optimising the configuration of large DNNs.</description>

      <title>GridPE: Unifying Positional Encoding in Transformers with a Grid Cell-Inspired Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding spatial location and relationships is a fundamental capability for modern artificial intelligence systems. Insights from human spatial cognition provide valuable guidance in this domain. Neuroscientific discoveries have highlighted the role of grid cells as a fundamental neural component for spatial representation, including distance computation, path integration, and scale discernment. In this paper, we introduce a novel positional encoding scheme inspired by Fourier analysis and the latest findings in computational neuroscience regarding grid cells. Assuming that grid cells encode spatial position through a summation of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate the translational invariance of the grid representation during inner product calculations. Additionally, we derive an optimal grid scale ratio for multi-dimensional Euclidean spaces based on principles of biological efficiency. Utilizing these computational principles, we have developed a Grid-cell inspired Positional Encoding technique, termed GridPE, for encoding locations within high-dimensional spaces. We integrated GridPE into the Pyramid Vision Transformer architecture. Our theoretical analysis shows that GridPE provides a unifying framework for positional encoding in arbitrary high-dimensional spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPE significantly enhances the performance of transformers, underscoring the importance of incorporating neuroscientific insights into the design of artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>A First Running Time Analysis of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged as a predominant approach for addressing multi-objective optimization problems. However, the theoretical foundation of multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), particularly the fundamental aspects like running time analysis, remains largely underexplored. Existing theoretical studies mainly focus on basic MOEAs, with little attention given to practical MOEAs. In this paper, we present a running time analysis of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for the first time. Specifically, we prove that the expected running time of SPEA2 for solving three commonly used multi-objective problems, i.e., $m$OneMinMax, $m$LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes, and $m$-OneJumpZeroJump, is $O(\mu n\cdot \min\{m\log n, n\})$, $O(\mu n^2)$, and $O(\mu n^k \cdot \min\{mn, 3^{m/2}\})$, respectively. Here $m$ denotes the number of objectives, and the population size $\mu$ is required to be at least $(2n/m+1)^{m/2}$, $(2n/m+1)^{m-1}$ and $(2n/m-2k+3)^{m/2}$, respectively. The proofs are accomplished through general theorems which are also applicable for analyzing the expected running time of other MOEAs on these problems, and thus can be helpful for future theoretical analysis of MOEAs.</description>

      <title>Improved Robustness and Hyperparameter Selection in the Dense Associative Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dense Associative Memory generalizes the Hopfield network by allowing for sharper interaction functions. This increases the capacity of the network as an autoassociative memory as nearby learned attractors will not interfere with one another. However, the implementation of the network relies on applying large exponents to the dot product of memory vectors and probe vectors. If the dimension of the data is large the calculation can be very large and result in imprecisions and overflow when using floating point numbers in a practical implementation. We describe the computational issues in detail, modify the original network description to mitigate the problem, and show the modification will not alter the networks' dynamics during update or training. We also show our modification greatly improves hyperparameter selection for the Dense Associative Memory, removing dependence on the interaction vertex and resulting in an optimal region of hyperparameters that does not significantly change with the interaction vertex as it does in the original network.</description>

      <title>CoLaNET -- A Spiking Neural Network with Columnar Layered Architecture for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01230v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, I describe a spiking neural network (SNN) architecture which, can be used in wide range of supervised learning classification tasks. It is assumed, that all participating signals (the classified object description, correct class label and SNN decision) have spiking nature. The distinctive feature of this architecture is a combination of prototypical network structures corresponding to different classes and significantly distinctive instances of one class (=columns) and functionally differing populations of neurons inside columns (=layers). The other distinctive feature is a novel combination of anti-Hebbian and dopamine-modulated plasticity. The plasticity rules are local and do not use the backpropagation principle. Besides that, as in my previous studies, I was guided by the requirement that the all neuron/plasticity models should be easily implemented on modern neurochips. I illustrate the high performance of my network on a task related to model-based reinforcement learning, namely, evaluation of proximity of an external world state to the target state.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Split Computing with Wake-Up Radios: Architecture and Design via Digital Twinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing leverages the sparsity of temporal data to reduce processing energy by activating a small subset of neurons and synapses at each time step. When deployed for split computing in edge-based systems, remote neuromorphic processing units (NPUs) can reduce the communication power budget by communicating asynchronously using sparse impulse radio (IR) waveforms. This way, the input signal sparsity translates directly into energy savings both in terms of computation and communication. However, with IR transmission, the main contributor to the overall energy consumption remains the power required to maintain the main radio on. This work proposes a novel architecture that integrates a wake-up radio mechanism within a split computing system consisting of remote, wirelessly connected, NPUs. A key challenge in the design of a wake-up radio-based neuromorphic split computing system is the selection of thresholds for sensing, wake-up signal detection, and decision making. To address this problem, as a second contribution, this work proposes a novel methodology that leverages the use of a digital twin (DT), i.e., a simulator, of the physical system, coupled with a sequential statistical testing approach known as Learn Then Test (LTT) to provide theoretical reliability guarantees. The proposed DT-LTT methodology is broadly applicable to other design problems, and is showcased here for neuromorphic communications. Experimental results validate the design and the analysis, confirming the theoretical reliability guarantees and illustrating trade-offs among reliability, energy consumption, and informativeness of the decisions.</description>

      <title>Using the Empirical Attainment Function for Analyzing Single-objective Black-box Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely accepted way to assess the performance of iterative black-box optimizers is to analyze their empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of pre-defined quality targets achieved not later than a given runtime. In this work, we consider an alternative approach, based on the empirical attainment function (EAF) and we show that the target-based ECDF is an approximation of the EAF. We argue that the EAF has several advantages over the target-based ECDF. In particular, it does not require defining a priori quality targets per function, captures performance differences more precisely, and enables the use of additional summary statistics that enrich the analysis. We also show that the average area over the convergence curves is a simpler-to-calculate, but equivalent, measure of anytime performance. To facilitate the accessibility of the EAF, we integrate a module to compute it into the IOHanalyzer platform. Finally, we illustrate the use of the EAF via synthetic examples and via the data available for the BBOB suite.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-Like Driving: Active Inference in Autonomous Vehicle Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) control through the application of active inference, a theory derived from neuroscience that conceptualizes the brain as a predictive machine. Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on Modular Pipelines, Imitation Learning, or Reinforcement Learning, each with inherent limitations in adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. Active inference addresses these challenges by minimizing prediction error (termed "surprise") through a dynamic model that balances perception and action. Our method integrates active inference with deep learning to manage lateral control in AVs, enabling them to perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to predict and adapt to environmental changes. Results from extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show promising outcomes, outperforming traditional methods in terms of adaptability and efficiency, thereby advancing the potential of active inference in real-world autonomous driving applications.</description>
