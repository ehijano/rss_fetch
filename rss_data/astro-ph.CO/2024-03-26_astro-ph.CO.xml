      <title>An Entangled Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a possible quantum signature of the early Universe that could lead to observational imprints of the quantum nature of the inflationary period. Graviton production in the presence of an inflaton scalar field results in entangled states in polarization. This is because of a non-trivial effect due to the derivatives on two scalar fluctuations and it provides a fingerprint that depends on the polarization of the graviton that Alice and/or Bob measured in their patch. At horizon crossing, interactions between the gravitons and inflatons perform the required Bell experiments leading to a definitive measure. We hint how this signature could be measure in the high-order correlation function of galaxies, in particular on the halo bias and the intrinsic alignment.</description>

      <title>Probing $H_0$ and resolving AGN disks with ultrafast photon counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry is a technique developed many decades ago, that has recently enjoyed a renaissance thanks in part to advances in photodetector technology. We investigate the potential for long-baseline optical intensity interferometry to observe bright, active galactic nuclei (AGN) associated with rapidly accreting supermassive black holes. We argue that realistic telescope arrays similar in area to existing Cherenkov arrays, if equipped with modern high-precision single photon detectors, can achieve a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio not only to detect distant AGN, but also to study them in great detail. We explore the science potential of such observations by considering two examples. First, we find that intensity interferometric observations of bright nearby AGN can allow detailed studies of the central accretion disks powering the AGN, allowing reconstruction of many disk properties like the radial profile. Next, we argue that intensity interferometers can spatially resolve the broad-line regions of AGN at cosmological distances, and thereby provide a geometric determination of the angular diameter distances to those AGN when combined with reverberation mapping. Since this measurement can be performed for AGN at distances of hundreds of megaparsecs, this directly measures the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, with a precision adequate to resolve the recent Hubble tension. Finally, we speculate on future applications that would be enabled by even larger intensity interferometer arrays.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves from the inflation potential with a tiny bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from the inflation potential with a tiny bump. We propose a Lorentz function that makes a tiny bump characteristic of the inflation model potential. This property makes the scalar field move locally ultra slowly, which not only makes the primordial curvature power spectrum have $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ peaks at a small scale but also satisfies observational constraints of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) on a large scale. Specifically, we calculate the abundances of PBHs for different mass ranges in this model, where PBHs with mass $10^{-12}M_\odot$ can make up almost all dark matter and PBHs with mass $10^{-5}M_\odot$ can explain OGLE ultrashort-timescale microlensing events. Moreover, we find that SIGWs accompanying the PBHs can be tested by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), TianQin, Taiji, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and DECIGO. As for the parameter set I, the consequent SIGWs can explain the NANOGrav 12.5yrs signal.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Microwave Background Signatures from Current-carrying Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our studies of the evolution and cosmological consequences of current-carrying cosmic string networks, described by a charge-velocity-dependent one scale (CVOS) model. We present a detailed calculation of the effects of these networks on the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in the context of this model, and specifically discuss how such current-carrying strings may be distinguished from their uncharged (Nambu-Goto) counterparts by current or forthcoming CMB data. We find that, under the CVOS hypothesis, the constraints on current-carrying strings should not differ much from those of their structureless counterparts in that the impact on the CMB can at most be reduced by a factor of ~25%. Nevertheless, the presence of a current and charge affects the distribution of power among scalar, vector and tensor modes, and also its distribution between small and large scales. It should therefore be possible for future high-sensitivity CMB experiments to distinguish between the two types of strings.</description>

      <title>Cosmic dipoles of active galactic nuclei display much larger amplitudes than the cosmic microwave background dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sky distributions of large samples of distant active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have shown dipoles significantly larger than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole. However, a recent Bayesian analysis of the QUAIA sample, comprising 1.3 million quasars, has yielded a dipole that seems to be in tandem with the CMB dipole, in contravention of most previous studies of AGN dipoles. Since the question has large cosmological implications, we investigate the QUAIA quasar sample afresh, by directly computing the dipole from asymmetries observed in the source number counts. We instead find a dipole 3-4 times as large as the CMB dipole though in the same direction. Further, it has been claimed elsewhere that the difference between the CMB dipole and the radio dipole estimated from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the first large catalogue that showed an AGN dipole about four times larger than the CMB dipole, can be fully accounted for by incorporating the shot-noise and clustering contributions to the total NVSS dipole. A careful reinvestigation of the NVSS dipole, however, shows that the random phenomena like shot noise or clustering cannot account for the actually observed NVSS asymmetries, which show a systematic dipole pattern over the sky.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses; this result is uniquely enabled by our semi-analytical approach. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations.

      <title>A primary study of CMB delensing for future CMB observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing the growing significance of contamination from weak gravitational lensing B-modes induced by Large Scale Structure, we investigate a thorough examination of delensing methods aiming at enhancing the sensitivity of r in primordial B-mode detection experiments. In this study, we focus on two specific delensing approaches. One approach involves computing the gradient-order lensing B-mode template by cross-correlating the E-mode with the lensing potential, and subsequently subtracting it from the observed B-mode signal. Another method entails remapping the observations using the estimated deflection angle. Then demonstrate the delensing efficiency using the simulated maps from future CMB polarization experiments, including two ground-based observations: sub-1 m small aperture telescope and 6 m large aperture telescope, and one future space mission with medium aperture telescope. The results reveal that delensing efficiency will be 40% with ground-based small-aperture only, and increases to 65% when combined with a large-aperture telescope. Furthermore, the future satellite experiment achieves an impressive delensing efficiency of approximately 80%.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts: Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detailed forecasts for the constraints on primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) that will be obtained with the LiteBIRD satellite. The constraints are driven by the effects of PMFs on the CMB anisotropies: the gravitational effects of magnetically-induced perturbations; the effects on the thermal and ionization history of the Universe; the Faraday rotation imprint on the CMB polarization; and the non-Gaussianities induced in polarization anisotropies. LiteBIRD represents a sensitive probe for PMFs and by exploiting all the physical effects, it will be able to improve the current limit coming from Planck. In particular, thanks to its accurate $B$-mode polarization measurement, LiteBIRD will improve the constraints on infrared configurations for the gravitational effect, giving $B_{\rm 1\,Mpc}^{n_{\rm B} =-2.9} &lt; 0.8$ nG at 95% C.L., potentially opening the possibility to detect nanogauss fields with high significance. We also observe a significant improvement in the limits when marginalized over the spectral index, $B_{1\,{\rm Mpc}}^{\rm marg}&lt; 2.2$ nG at 95% C.L. From the thermal history effect, which relies mainly on $E$-mode polarization data, we obtain a significant improvement for all PMF configurations, with the marginalized case, $\sqrt{\langle B^2\rangle}^{\rm marg}&lt;0.50$ nG at 95% C.L. Faraday rotation constraints will take advantage of the wide frequency coverage of LiteBIRD and the high sensitivity in $B$ modes, improving the limits by orders of magnitude with respect to current results, $B_{1\,{\rm Mpc}}^{n_{\rm B} =-2.9} &lt; 3.2$ nG at 95% C.L. Finally, non-Gaussianities of the $B$-mode polarization can probe PMFs at the level of 1 nG, again significantly improving the current bounds from Planck. Altogether our forecasts represent a broad collection of complementary probes, providing conservative limits on PMF characteristics that will be achieved with LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Beyond-$\Lambda$CDM Cosmologies with Bayesian Neural Networks II: Massive Neutrinos, Baryonic Feedback, and the Theoretical Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the capacity of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to detect new physics in the dark matter power spectrum. As in previous studies, the Bayesian Cosmological Network (BaCoN) classifies spectra into one of 5 classes: $\Lambda$CDM, $f(R)$, $w$CDM, Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati (DGP) gravity and a 'random' class, with this work extending it to include the effects of massive neutrinos and baryonic feedback. We further develop the treatment of theoretical errors in BaCoN-II, investigating several approaches and identifying the one that best allows the trained network to generalise to other power spectrum modelling prescriptions. In particular, we compare power spectra data produced by EuclidEmulator2, HMcode and halofit, all supplemented with the halo model reaction to model beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics. We investigate BNN-classifiers trained on these sets of spectra, adding in Stage-IV survey noise and various theoretical error models. Using our optimal theoretical error model, our fiducial classifier achieves a total classification accuracy of $\sim$ 95% when it is trained on EuclidEmulator2-based spectra with modification parameters drawn from a Gaussian distribution centred around $\Lambda$CDM ($f(R)$: $\sigma_{fR0} = 10^{-5.5}$, DGP: $\sigma_{r\mathrm{c}} = 0.173$, $w$CDM: $\sigma_{w0} = 0.097$, $\sigma_{wa}=0.32$). This strengthens the promise of this method to glean the maximal amount of unbiased gravitational and cosmological information from forthcoming Stage-IV galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Modes of the Dark Ages 21cm field accessible to a lunar radio interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At redshifts beyond $z \gtrsim 30$, the 21cm line from neutral hydrogen is expected to be essentially the only viable probe of the 3D matter distribution. The lunar far-side is an extremely appealing site for future radio arrays that target this signal, as it is protected from terrestrial radio frequency interference, and has no ionosphere to attenuate and absorb radio emission at low frequencies (tens of MHz and below). We forecast the sensitivity of low-frequency lunar radio arrays to the bispectrum of the 21cm brightness temperature field, which can in turn be used to probe primordial non-Gaussianity generated by particular early universe models. We account for the loss of particular regions of Fourier space due to instrumental limitations and systematic effects, and predict the sensitivity of different representative array designs to local-type non-Gaussianity in the bispectrum, parametrised by $f_{\rm NL}$. Under the most optimistic assumption of sample variance-limited observations, we find that $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}) \lesssim 0.01$ could be achieved for several broad redshift bins at $z \gtrsim 30$ if foregrounds can be removed effectively. These values degrade to between $\sigma(f_{\rm NL}) \sim 0.03$ and $0.7$ for $z=30$ to $z=170$ respectively when a large foreground wedge region is excluded.</description>

      <title>Constraining the history of reheating with the NANOGrav 15-year data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Equatorial First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2) is a new survey designed as the successor of the original MaDCoWS survey. MaDCoWS2 improves upon its predecessor by using deeper optical and infrared data and a more powerful detection algorithm (PZWav). As input to the search, we use grz photometry from DECaLS in combination with W1 and W2 photometry from the CatWISE2020 catalog to derive the photometric redshifts with full redshift probability distribution functions for WISE-selected galaxies. Cluster candidates are then detected using the PZWav algorithm to find three-dimensional galaxy overdensities from the sky positions and photometric redshifts. This paper provides the first MaDCoWS2 data release, covering 1461 (1838 without masking) deg^2 centered on the Hyper-SuprimeCam Subaru Strategic Program equatorial fields. Within this region, we derive a catalog of 22,970 galaxy cluster candidates detected at S/N&gt;5. These clusters span the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2, including 1312 candidates at z&gt;1.5. We compare MaDCoWS2 to six existing catalogs in the area. We rediscover 60%-92% of the clusters in these surveys at S/N&gt;5. The medians of the absolute redshift offset are &lt;0.02 relative to these surveys, while the standard deviations are less than 0.06. The median offsets between the detection position from MaDCoWS2 and other surveys are less than 0.25 Mpc. We quantify the relation between S/N and gas mass, total mass, luminosity, and richness from other surveys using a redshift-dependent power law relation. We find that the S/N-richness relation exhibits the lowest scatter.</description>

      <title>Limits on Dark Matter Compact Objects implied by Supermagnified Stars in Lensing Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermagnified stars are gravitationally lensed individual stars that are located close to a caustic of a lensing galaxy cluster, and have their flux magnified by a large enough factor (typically ~ 1000) to make them detectable with present telescopes. The maximum magnification is limited by microlensing caused by intracluster stars or other compact objects, which create a network of corrugated critical lines with an angular width proportional to the surface density of microlenses. We consider a set of 9 cases of supermagnified stars reported in the literature, and derive an upper limit on the surface density of compact objects, such as primordial black holes, that might be present as a fraction of the dark matter in addition to known intracluster stars. Any such additional compact objects would widen the corrugated critical line network and therefore the width of the distribution of supermagnified stars around the modeled critical lines of the lens. We find that any compact objects, including primordial black holes, with masses above $\sim 10^{-6}\, M_{\odot}$ (for which the microcaustics are smaller than the typical angular size of supermagnified stars) cannot account for more than ~ 3% of the dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gravitational particle production (GPP) of a massive, Abelian, vector (Proca) field during inflation in the presence of nonminimal coupling to gravity may suffer from an instability which leads to runaway production of high-momentum modes. This is untenable unless there is some mechanism to regulate the runaway. We discuss the parameter space of the particle mass and nonminimal couplings where such a runaway occurs and possible ways to tame the runaway. We find that there is no obvious way to resolve the runaway in a UV completion or with kinetic mixing to the standard model.</description>

      <title>Minimal decaying dark matter: from cosmological tensions to neutrino signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The invisible decay of cold dark matter into a slightly lighter dark sector particle on cosmological time-scales has been proposed as a solution to the $S_8$ tension. In this work we discuss the possible embedding of this scenario within a particle physics framework, and we investigate its phenomenology. We identify a minimal dark matter decay setup that addresses the $S_8$ tension, while avoiding the stringent constraints from indirect dark matter searches. In our scenario, the dark sector contains two singlet fermions $N_{1,2}$, quasi-degenerate in mass, and carrying lepton number so that the heaviest state ($N_2$) decays into the lightest ($N_1$) and two neutrinos via a higher-dimensional operator $N_2\to \bar N_1\nu\nu$. The conservation of lepton number, and the small phase-space available for the decay, forbids the decay channels into hadrons and strongly suppresses the decays into photons or charged leptons. We derive complementary constraints on the model parameters from neutrino detectors, freeze-in dark matter production via $\nu\nu\to N_1N_2$, collider experiments and blazar observations, and we show that the upcoming JUNO neutrino observatory could detect signals of dark matter decay for model parameters addressing the $S_8$ tension if the dark matter mass is below $\simeq 1$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Significant impact of Galactic dark matter particles on annihilation signals from Sagittarius analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the gamma-ray signal from dark matter (DM) annihilation from analogues of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the Auriga cosmological simulations. For velocity-dependent annihilation cross sections, we compute emissions from simulated Sgr subhalos and from the Milky Way (MW) foreground. In addition to the annihilation signals from DM particles bound to Sgr, we consider for the first time the annihilation of DM particles bound to the MW that overlap spatially with Sgr. For p-wave models this contribution can enhance the signal by over an order of magnitude, while for d-wave models the enhancement can be over two orders of magnitude. For Sommerfeld models, the corresponding emission decreases by up to nearly an order of magnitude. For Sommerfeld and s-wave models, the Sgr source can be visible above the MW foreground emission, while for p and d-wave models, the signal towards Sgr is most likely dominated by foreground MW emission. We interpret our results within the context of the observed gamma-ray emission from Sgr, finding that the templates from simulations likely have spatial morphology that is too extended to explain the point-like emission that is observed.</description>

      <title>The Non-triviality of Dynamical Chern-Simons Gravity and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the growing interest in gravitational-wave and cosmological parity-violating effects in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, it is crucial to investigate whether the scalar-gravitational Pontryagin term in dCS persists when formulated in the context of the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$ anomaly in the Standard Model (SM). In particular, it has been argued that dCS gravity can be reduced to Einstein gravity after ''rotating away'' the gravitational-Pontryagin coupling into the phase of the Weinberg operator $\unicode{x2013}$ analogous to the rotation of the axion zero-mode into the quark mass matrix. We find that dCS is nontrivial if the scalar field $\phi$ has significant space-time dependence from dynamics. We provide a comprehensive consideration of the dCS classical and quantum symmetries relevant for embedding a dCS sector in the SM. We find that, because of the B-L chiral gravitational anomaly, the scalar-Pontryagin term cannot be absorbed by a field redefinition. Assuming a minimal extension of the SM, we also find that a coupling of the dCS scalar with right-handed neutrinos induces both the scalar-Pontryagin coupling and an axion-like phase in the dimension-five Weinberg operator. We comment on the issue of gauging the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{B}-\text{L}}$, the observational effects with these two operators present for upcoming experiments, and the origin of dCS gravity in string theory.</description>

      <title>Bouncing behavior in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity: Phantom crossing and energy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the bouncing behavior of the universe within the framework of $f(R,L_m)$ gravity, using a simple form of $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+L_m^\gamma$ (where $\gamma$ is a free model parameter) as previously studied. The model predicts a vanishing Hubble parameter in the early and late times, with the deceleration parameter approaching a specific limit at the bouncing point. The EoS parameter is observed to cross the phantom divide line ($\omega=-1$) near the bouncing point, indicating a significant transition from a contracting to an expanding phase. The model satisfies the necessary energy conditions for a successful bouncing scenario, with violations indicating exotic matter near the bouncing point. Stability conditions are satisfied for certain values of $\gamma$ near the bouncing point, but potential instabilities in late-time evolution require further investigation. Finally, we conclude that the $f(R,L_m)$ gravity model is promising for understanding the universe's dynamics, especially during events like the bouncing phase.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the properties of total time-derivative terms as well as terms proportional to the free equation of motion (EOM) in a Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. They are relevant to the correct calculation of correlation functions of curvature perturbations in the context of inflationary Universe. We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the operator or the path-integral formalism, but they give the same correlation functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments on loop calculations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Lens Light Complexity with A Novel Multi-Gaussian Expansion Approach for Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a strong gravitational lensing system, the distorted light from a source is analysed to infer the properties of the lens. However, light emitted by the lens itself can contaminate the image of the source, introducing systematic errors in the analysis. We present a simple and efficient lens light model based on the well-tested multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) method for representing galaxy surface brightness profiles, which we combine with a semi-linear inversion scheme for pixelized source modelling. Testing it against realistic mock lensing images, we show that our scheme can fit the lensed images to the noise level, with relative differences between the true input and best-fit lens light model remaining below 5%. We apply the MGE lens light model to 38 lenses from the HST SLACS sample. We find that the new scheme provides a good fit for the majority of the sample with only 3 exceptions -- these show clear asymmetric residuals in the lens light. We examine the radial dependence of the ellipticity and position angles and confirm that it is common for a typical lens galaxy to exhibit twisting, non-elliptical isophotes and boxy / disky isophotes. Our MGE lens light model will be a valuable tool for understanding the hidden complexity of the lens mass distribution.</description>

Abstract: At the Royal Society meeting in 2023, we have mainly presented our lunar orbit array concept called DSL, and also briefly introduced a concept of a lunar surface array, LARAF. As the DSL concept had been presented before, in this article we introduce the LARAF. We propose to build an array in the far side of the Moon, with a master station which handles the data collection and processing, and 20 stations with maximum baseline of 10 km. Each station consists 12 membrane antenna units, and the stations are connected to the master station by power line and optical fiber. The array will make interferometric observation in the 0.1-50 MHz band during the lunar night, powered by regenerated fuel cells (RFCs). The whole array can be carried to the lunar surface with a heavy rocket mission, and deployed with a rover in 8 months. Such an array would be an important step in the long term development of lunar based ultralong wavelength radio astronomy. It has a sufficiently high sensitivity to observe many radio sources in the sky, though still short of the dark age fluctuations. We discuss the possible options in the power supply, data communication, deployment, etc.</description>

      <title>Coupling elastic media to gravitational waves: an effective field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a gravitational wave (GW) with an elastic body is usually described in terms of a GW "force" driving the oscillations of the body's normal modes. However, this description is only possible for GW frequencies for which the response of the elastic body is dominated by a few normal modes. At higher frequencies the normal modes blend into a quasi-continuum and a field-theoretical description, as pioneered by Dyson already in 1969, becomes necessary. However, since the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ is an intrinsically relativistic object, a consistent coupling to GWs can only be obtained within a relativistic (and, in fact generally covariant) theory of elasticity. We develop such a formalism using the methods of modern effective field theories, and we use it to provide a derivation of the interaction of elastic bodies with GWs valid also in the high-frequency regime, providing a first-principle derivation of Dyson's result (and partially correcting it). We also stress that the field-theoretical results are obtained working in the TT frame, while the description in terms of a force driving the normal modes is only valid in the proper detector frame. We show how to transform the results between the two frames. Beside an intrinsic conceptual interest, these results are relevant to the computation of the sensitivity of the recently proposed Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore new constraints on phantom scalar field cosmologies with a scalar field employing early times catalogues related to CMB measurements, along with the local standard observables, like Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements (Cosmic Clocks), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) baselines. In particular, we studied a tracker phantom field with hyperbolic polar coordinates that have been proposed in the literature. The main goal is to obtain precise cosmological constraints for $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$, in comparison to other constructions that present tension in early cosmological parameters. Our results show that phantom scalar field cosmologies have a reduced statistical tension on $H_0$ that it is less than 3$\sigma$ using model-independent CMB catalogues as SPT-3G+WMAP9 and ACTPol DR-4+WMAP9 baselines. This suggests these models using a different phantom potential might address the Hubble constant problem and reduce the systematics involved.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Regularization of the Graviton Stress Tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the details for the covariant renormalization of the stress tensor for vacuum tensor perturbations at the level of the effective action, adopting Hadamard regularization techniques to isolate short distance divergences and gauge fixing via the Faddeev-Popov procedure. The subsequently derived renormalized stress tensor can be related to more familiar forms reliant upon an averaging prescription, such as the Isaacson or Misner-Thorne-Wheeler forms. The latter, however, are premised on a prior scale separation (beyond which the averaging is invoked) and therefore unsuited for the purposes of renormalization. This can lead to potentially unphysical conclusions when taken as a starting point for the computation of any observable that needs regularization, such as the energy density associated to a stochastic background. Any averaging prescription, if needed, should only be invoked at the end of the renormalization procedure. The latter necessarily involves the imposition of renormalization conditions via a physical measurement at some fixed scale, which we retrace for primordial gravitational waves sourced from vacuum fluctuations through direct or indirect observation.</description>

      <title>Forklens: Accurate weak-lensing shear measurement with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most important probes of the nature of dark matter and dark energy. In order to extract cosmological information from next-generation weak lensing surveys (e.g., Euclid, Roman, LSST, and CSST) as much as possible, accurate measurements of weak lensing shear are required. There are existing algorithms to measure the weak lensing shear on imaging data, which have been successfully applied in previous surveys. In the meantime, machine learning (ML) has been widely recognized in various astrophysics applications in modeling and observations. In this work, we present a fully deep-learning-based approach to measuring weak lensing shear accurately. Our approach comprises two modules. The first one contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) with two branches for taking galaxy images and point spread function (PSF) simultaneously, and the output of this module includes the galaxy's magnitude, size, and shape. The second module includes a multiple-layer neural network (NN) to calibrate weak-lensing shear measurements. We name the program Forklens and make it publicly available online. Applying Forklens to CSST-like mock images, we achieve consistent accuracy with traditional approaches (such as moment-based measurement and forward model fitting) on the sources with high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N, &gt; 20). For the sources with S/N &lt; 10, Forklens exhibits an $\sim 36\%$ higher Pearson coefficient on galaxy ellipticity measurements. After adopting galaxy weighting, the shear measurements with Forklens deliver accuracy levels to $0.2\%$. The whole procedure of Forklens is automated and costs about $0.7$ milliseconds per galaxy, which is appropriate for adequately taking advantage of the sky coverage and depth of the upcoming weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Broken blue-tilted inflationary gravitational waves: a joint analysis of NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data</title>

Abstract: Recently, the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hertz band. The spectrum of inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) is unknown, which might exhibit different power law at different frequency-bands, thus if the PTA signal is primordial, it will be significant to explore the underlying implications of current PTA and CMB data on IGW. In this paper, we perform a joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for a broken power-law spectrum of IGW with the NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data. It is found that though the bestfit spectral tilt of IGW at PTA band is $n^\text{PTA}_\text{T} =2.42^{+0.32}_{-0.91}$, at CMB band the bestfit is $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} =0.55^{+0.37}_{-0.10}$ while a detectable amplitude of $r$ with $n^\text{CMB}_\text{T} \simeq 0$ is still compatible. The implication of our results for inflation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing the Anisotropy and Non-Gaussianity in the Redshift Space through the Conditional Moments of the First Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Focusing on the redshift space observations with plane-parallel approximation and relying on the rotational dependency of the general definition of excursion sets, we introduce the so-called conditional moments of the first derivative ($cmd$) measures for the smoothed matter density field in three dimensions. We derive the perturbative expansion of $cmd$ for the real space and redshift space where peculiar velocity disturbs the galaxies' observed locations. Our criteria can successfully recognize the contribution of linear Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Our results demonstrate that the $cmd$ measure has significant sensitivity for pristine constraining the redshift space distortion parameter $\beta=f/b$ and interestingly, the associated normalized quantity in the Gaussian linear Kaiser limit has only $\beta$ dependency. Implementation of the synthetic anisotropic Gaussian field approves the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results. Including the first-order contribution of non-Gaussianity perturbatively in the $cmd$ criterion implies that the N-body simulations for the Quijote suite in the redshift space have been mildly skewed with a higher value for the threshold greater than zero. The non-Gaussianity for the perpendicular direction to the line of sight in the redshift space for smoothing scales $R\gtrsim 20$ Mpc h$^{-1}$ is almost the same as the real space. In contrast, the non-Gaussianity along the line of sight direction in redshift space is magnified. The Fisher forecasts indicate an almost significant enhancement in constraining the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $n_s$ when using $cmd+cr$ jointly.</description>

Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are well-motivated and actively searched for new particles that would mix with the active neutrinos. We study their phenomenology when they are produced in the evaporation of early Universe black holes, a novel production mechanism that differs from all others and does not depend on the active-sterile mixing. The resulting hotter sterile neutrinos have a distinct spectrum and could be warm dark matter in the 0.3 MeV to 0.3 TeV mass range, distinct from the typical keV range. The possible coincidence of X-rays and gravitational waves is a unique novel signature of our scenario.</description>

      <title>Constraining LLTB models with galaxy cluster counts from next generation surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Universe's assumed homogeneity and isotropy is known as the cosmological principle. It is one of the assumptions that lead to the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and it is a cornerstone of modern cosmology, because the metric plays a crucial role into the determination of the cosmological observables. Thus, it is of paramount importance to question this principle and perform observational tests that may falsify this hypothesis. Here we explore the use of galaxy cluster counts as a probe of a large-scale inhomogeneity, which is a novel approach for the study of inhomogeneous models, and to determine the precision with which future galaxy cluster surveys will be able to test the cosmological principle. We present forecast constraints on the inhomogeneous Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model with a cosmological constant and cold dark matter, from a combination of simulated data according to a compilation of `Stage-IV' galaxy surveys following a methodology that involves the use of a mass function correction from numerical $N$-body simulations of an LTB cosmology. When considering the \lcdm fiducial model as a baseline for constructing our mock catalogs, we find that our combination of the forthcoming cluster surveys, will improve the constraints on the cosmological principle parameters as well on the FLRW parameters by about $50\%$ with respect to previous similar forecasts performed using geometrical and linear growth of structure probes, with $\pm20\%$ variations depending on the level of knowledge of systematic effects.These results indicate that galaxy cluster abundances are sensitive probes of inhomogeneity, and that next-generation galaxy cluster surveys, will thoroughly test homogeneity at cosmological scales, tightening the constraints on possible violations of the cosmological principle in the framework of $\Lambda$LTB scenarios.

      <title>Toward More Realistic Mass Functions For Ultradense Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs) are high concentrations of dark matter, assumed to have formed deep in the radiation-dominated era from amplified primordial perturbations. In this work we improve the previous works for the calculation of UDMH abundance by elaborating on the formation process of these halos by including various physical and geometrical modifications in the analysis. In particular, we investigate the impact of angular momentum, dynamical friction and triaxial collapse on the predicted mass functions for UDMHs. We perform the calculations for four primordial power spectra with different amplified features that allow for primordial black hole and UDHM formation in wide and narrow mass ranges. We also apply this analysis in the context of two possible scenarios for dark matter: the single-component and the multi-component. We find that the abundance of UDMHs is prominently enhanced in the presence of these more realistic mass functions.</description>

      <title>Mass reconstruction and noise reduction with cosmic-web environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The clustering of galaxies and their connections to their initial conditions is a major means by which we learn about cosmology. However, the stochasticity between galaxies and their underlying matter field is a major limitation for precise measurements of galaxy clustering. Efforts have been made with an optimal weighting scheme to reduce this stochasticity using the mass-dependent clustering of dark matter haloes. Here, we show that this is not optimal. We demonstrate that the cosmic-web environments (voids, sheets, filaments \&amp; knots) of haloes, when combined linearly with the linear bias, provide extra information for reducing stochasticity in terms of two-point statistics. Using the environmental information alone can increase the signal-to-noise of clustering by a factor of 3 better than the white-noise level at the scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations. The information about the environment and halo mass are complementary. Their combination increases the signal-to-noise by another factor of 2-3. The information about the cosmic web correlates with other properties of haloes, including halo concentrations and tidal forces -- all are related to the assembly bias of haloes.</description>

      <title>A proposal to improve the accuracy of cosmological observables and address the Hubble tension problem</title>

Abstract: (abridged)Cosmological observational programs often compare their data not only with $\Lambda$CDM, but also with extensions applying dynamical models of dark energy (DDE), with a time-dependent equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$. We found a degeneracy in the customary computational procedure for the expansion history, once DDE models are applied. This degeneracy provides an infinite number of cosmological models reproducing the Planck-measured CMB spectrum. Moreover, this degeneracy biases the comparison of $\Lambda$CDM with DDE extensions. We present a complementary computational approach, which breaks this degeneracy: the ``fixed early densities (EDs) approach'' evolves cosmological models from the early Universe to the present, in contrast to the customary ``fixed $H_0$ approach'' which evolves cosmological models in reverse order. We find the EDs are accurately approximated by the $\Lambda$CDM model. We implement a refined procedure, appyling both approaches, in an amended version of the code CLASS, where we focus on representative DDE models using the CPL parametrization. Our results reveal that the CPL model $w(a)=-0.9 + 0.1(1-a)$ could provide a resolution to the Hubble tension problem. Moreover, we find that combining both approaches, while requesting to yield consistent results and being in agreement with observations across cosmic time, can serve as a kind of consistency check for cosmological models. Moreover, our proposed consistency check applied within current data analysis methods will increase the accuracy of inferred cosmological parameters significantly, in particular for $\Lambda$CDM extensions. We find characteristic signatures in the late expansion histories of cosmological models, allowing a phenomenological discrimination of DE candidates and a possible resolution of the Hubble tension, by ongoing and future observational programs.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Distribution Functions and Energy Distributions of Dark Matter Particles in Haloes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a spherical dark matter halo with isotropic velocity distribution, the phase space distribution function (DF), the energy distribution, and the density profile form a set of self-consistent description of its equilibrium state, and knowing one is sufficient to determine the other two. The Navarro-Frenk-White density profile (NFW profile) is known to be a good approximation to the spherically-averaged density distribution in simulated haloes. The DARKexp energy distribution is also known to compare well with the simulated energy distribution. We present a quantitative assessment of the NFW and DARKexp fits to the simulated DF and energy distribution for a wide range of haloes in a dark-matter-only simulation from the IllustrisTNG Project. As expected, we find that the NFW fits work well except at low energy when the density at small radii deviates from the NFW profile. Further, the NFW and DARKexp fits have comparable accuracy in the region where both fit well, but the DARKexp fits are better at low energy because they require matching of the central gravitational potential. We also find an approximate relation between the energy scale parameterizing the DARKexp energy distribution and that defined by the characteristic density and radius of the NFW profile. This relation may be linked to the relaxation process during halo formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to estimate the value of primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$) parameter directly from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps using a convolutional neural network (CNN). While traditional methods rely on complex statistical techniques, this study proposes a simpler approach that employs a neural network to estimate $f_{\rm NL}$. The neural network model is trained on simulated CMB maps with known $f_{\rm NL}$ in range of $[-50,50]$, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics. The results indicate that the proposed approach can accurately estimate $f_{\rm NL}$ values from CMB maps with a significant reduction in complexity compared to traditional methods. With $500$ validation data, the $f^{\rm output}_{\rm NL}$ against $f^{\rm input}_{\rm NL}$ graph can be fitted as $y=ax+b$, where $a=0.980^{+0.098}_{-0.102}$ and $b=0.277^{+0.098}_{-0.101}$, indicating the unbiasedness of the primordial non-Gaussianity estimation. The results indicate that the CNN technique can be widely applied to other cosmological parameter estimation directly from CMB images.</description>

      <title>Absence of torsion : Clue from Starobinsky model of f(R) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any noticeable observable effects of higher-rank anti-symmetric tensor fields, such as space-time torsion, in any natural phenomena. Here we address the possible explanation of torsion, which may often be identified with the field strength tensor of the second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field. Within the framework of f(R) gravity, we explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general higher curvature model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while the values of different cosmological parameters follow acceptable values in the framework of standard cosmology at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity (i.e. different values of n ), only for Starobinsky model (n = 2), the Kalb Ramond field gets naturally suppressed with cosmological evolution. In contrast, for other models (n both positive and negative), despite their agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar field associated with the higher derivative degree of freedom induces an enhancement in Kalb-Ramond field and thereby contradicts the observation. The result does not change even if we include the Cosmological Constant. Thus our result reveals that among different $f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of space-time torsion along with a consistent cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Improving SDSS Cosmological Constraints through $\beta$-Skeleton Weighted Correlation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\beta$-skeleton approach can be conveniently utilized to construct the cosmic web based on the spatial geometry distribution of galaxies, particularly in sparse samples. This method plays a key role in establishing the three-dimensional structure of the Universe and serves as a tool for quantitatively characterizing the nature of the cosmic web. This study is the first application of $\beta$-skeleton information as weights in mark weighted correlation functions (MCFs), presenting a novel statistical measure. We have applied the $\beta$-skeleton approach to the CMASS NGC galaxy samples from SDSS BOSS DR12 in the redshift interval $0.45 \leq z \leq 0.55$. Additionally, we applied this approach to three COLA cosmological simulations with different settings ($\Omega_m=0.25, \Omega_m=0.31, \Omega_m=0.4$) for comparison. We measured three MCFs, each weighted by: i) the number of neighboring galaxies around each galaxy; ii) the average distance of each galaxy from its surrounding neighbors; iii) the reciprocal of the average distance of each galaxy from its surrounding neighbors. By comparing measurements and calculating corresponding $\chi^2$ statistics, we observe high sensitivity to the cosmological parameter $\Omega_m$ through a joint analysis of the two-point correlation and three MCFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that power measurements of single quasiparticle devices open a new avenue to detect dark matter (DM). The threshold of these devices is set by the Cooper pair binding energy, and is therefore so low that they can detect DM as light as about an MeV incoming from the Galactic halo, as well as the low-velocity thermalized DM component potentially present in the Earth. Using existing power measurements with these new devices, as well as power measurements with SuperCDMS-CPD, we set new constraints on the spin-independent DM scattering cross section for DM masses from about 10 MeV to 10 GeV. We outline future directions to improve sensitivity to both halo DM and a thermalized DM population in the Earth using power deposition in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The mass-to-distance ratio for a set of megamaser AGN black holes by employing a general relativistic method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Motivated by recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in determining black hole (BH) parameters, we continue to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the supermassive BHs hosted at the core of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of NGC 1320, NGC 1194, NGC 5495, and Mrk 1029.
  Aims .To study the properties of SMBHs at the centers of selected AGNs by a full general relativistic method which allows us to address the potential detection of relativistic effects within such astrophysical systems.
  Methods. In order to perform statistical estimations with publicly available observational data, we use a general relativistic model that describes black hole rotation curves and further employ a Bayesian fitting method.
  Results. We estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the aforementioned BHs, their $x_0$-offset as well as the recessional redshifts of the host galaxies produced by both peculiar motion and cosmological expansion of the Universe. Finally, we calculate the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to the BH for each AGN. This gravitational redshift is a general relativistic effect produced by the gravitational field of the BH properly included in the modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the cosmological dynamics of a dilatonic ghost condensate field as a source of dark energy, which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through torsion. We performed a detailed phase-space analysis by finding all the critical points and their stability conditions. Also, we compared our results with the latest $H(z)$ and Supernovae Ia observational data. In particular, we found the conditions for the existence of scaling regimes during the dark matter era. Furthermore, we obtained the conditions for a successful exit from the scaling regime, such that, at late times, the universe tends towards an attractor point describing the dark energy-dominated era. These intriguing features can allow us to alleviate the energy scale problem of dark energy since, during a scaling regime, the field energy density is not necessarily negligible at early times.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for obtaining unbiased signal estimates in the presence of a significant unknown background, eliminating the need for a parametric model for the background itself. Our approach is based on a minimal set of conditions for observation and background estimators, which are typically satisfied in practical scenarios. To showcase the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to simulated data from the planned dielectric axion haloscope MADMAX.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation with a Gauss-Bonnet term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higgs inflation with a Gauss-Bonnet term is studied in the Einstein frame. Our model features two coupling functions, $\Omega^2(\phi)$ and $\omega(\phi)$, coupled to the Ricci scalar and Gauss-Bonnet combinations. We found a special relation $\Omega^2 \propto \omega$ sets the system a lot more simplified; therefore, we take it for granted in our analytical studies. As a result of a Weyl transformation to the Einstein frame, we notice the emergence of new interactions: a non-minimal kinetic coupling between the scalar field and gravity and a derivative self-interaction of the scalar field. In the Einstein frame, we investigate the cosmological implications of these interactions by deriving the background equation of motion and observable quantities. Our numerical result on $n_S$ vs. $r$ suggests our model is consistent with the observational data for a wide range of the model parameter, $-1.4\times 10^4\lesssim \alpha \equiv \frac{\omega}{\Omega^2} \lesssim 8\times 10^3$, where both the positive and negative values of $\alpha$ are allowed. As the Gauss-Bonnet contributions decay away with time after inflation, the propagation speed of gravitational waves turned out to be consistent with the recent constraints on the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs) without inducing ghost instability.</description>

      <title>Alleviating both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions in Tsallis cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present how Tsallis cosmology can alleviate both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions simultaneously. Such a modified cosmological scenario is obtained by the application of the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, but using the non-additive Tsallis entropy, instead of the standard Bekenstein-Hawking one. Hence, one obtains modified Friedmann equations, with extra terms that depend on the new Tsallis exponent $\delta$ that quantifies the departure from standard entropy. We show that for particular $\delta$ choices we can obtain a phantom effective dark energy, which is known to be one of the sufficient mechanisms that can alleviate $H_0$ tension. Additionally, for the same parameter choice we obtain an increased friction term and an effective Newton's constant smaller than the usual one, and thus the $\sigma_8$ tension is also solved. These features act as a significant advantage of Tsallis modified cosmology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the evolution of the entanglement entropy for a massless field within a spherical region throughout the inflationary period and the subsequent era of radiation domination, starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum. In order to focus on the entanglement of modes that are directly accessible to observations, we impose an ultraviolet cutoff set by the wavelength of the last mode that exited the horizon at the end of inflation. The transition of each mode towards a squeezed state upon horizon exit during inflation and the additional squeezing when radiation domination sets in enhance the entanglement entropy. Shortly after the transition to the radiation-dominated era, a volume term develops and becomes the leading contribution to the entropy at late times, as is common for systems lying in squeezed states. We estimate the magnitude of the entropy and discuss its interpretation in the light of the quantum to classical transition for modes exiting the horizon during inflation. Our results raise the possibility that the quantum nature of weakly interacting fields, such as gravitational waves resulting from tensor modes during inflation, may be detectable in today's universe. On the other hand, an observer with no knowledge of the degrees of freedom beyond the horizon would interpret the entropy as thermal. From this point of view, the reheating after inflation would be a result of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Inspiraling Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a multifield dark energy model, which arises from certain rapid-turning and inspiraling trajectories in field space. We find the speed of sound $c_s$ of the dark energy perturbations around the background and show that $c_s$ is monotonically decreasing with time. Furthermore, it has a positive-definite lower bound that implies a certain clustering scale. We also extend the previously known background solution for dark energy to an exact solution that includes matter. This allows us to address the implications of our model for two cosmological tensions. More precisely, we argue that the $\sigma_8$ tension can be alleviated generically, while reducing the Hubble tension requires certain constraints on the parameter space of the model. Notably, a necessary condition for alleviating the Hubble tension is that the transition from matter domination to the dark energy epoch begins earlier than in $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The impact of an evolving stellar initial mass function on early galaxies and reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations with JWST have revealed an unexpected high abundance of bright z&gt;10 galaxy candidates. We explore whether a stellar initial mass function (IMF) that becomes increasingly top-heavy towards higher redshifts and lower gas-phase metallicities results in a higher abundance of bright objects in the early universe and how it affects the evolution of galaxy properties compared to a constant IMF. We incorporate such an evolving IMF into the Astraeus framework that couples galaxy evolution and reionisation in the first billion years. Our implementation accounts for the IMF dependence of supernova feedback, metal enrichment, ionising and ultraviolet radiation emission. We conduct two simulations: one with a Salpeter IMF and one with the evolving IMF. Compared to a constant Salpeter IMF, we find that (i) the higher abundance of massive stars in the evolving IMF results in more light per unit stellar mass, a slower build-up of stellar mass and lower stellar-to-halo mass ratio; (ii) due to the self-similar growth of the underlying dark matter halos, the evolving IMF's star formation main sequence hardly deviates from that of the Salpeter IMF; (iii) the evolving IMF's stellar mass-metallicity relation shifts to higher metallicities while its halo mass-metallicity relation remains unchanged; (iv) the evolving IMF's median dust-to-metal mass ratio is lower due to its stronger SN feedback; (v) the evolving IMF requires lower values of the escape fraction of ionising photons and exhibits a flatter median relation and smaller scatter between the ionising photons emerging from galaxies and the halo mass. Yet, the topology of the ionised regions hardly changes compared to the Salpeter IMF. These results suggest that a top-heavier IMF alone is unlikely to explain the higher abundance of bright z&gt;10 sources, since the lower mass-to-light ratio is counteracted by the stronger stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>Conformal Transformations and Cosmological Perturbations in New General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conformal transformations in the most general parity-preserving models of the New General Relativity type. Then we apply them to analysis of cosmological perturbations in the (simplest) spatially flat cosmologies. Strong coupling issues around Minkowski spacetime are seen for many special cases of these models. At the same time, the behaviour of the most general three-parameter case seems to be very robust, presumably always with only the eight first-class constraints coming from diffeomorphisms. Also the case of the so-called 1-parameter New GR doesn't show any discontinuity between Minkowski and the cosmology, though without showing any deviations from GR which would be observable at this level either.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from JWST and NANOGrav</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the recent statistics of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $James \ Webb \ Space \ Telescope$ (JWST) data at $z \sim 3.4$ to address two aspects of the feedback and evolution scenarios of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB). We find that the JWST data provide evidence for the members of a binary black hole being 'lit' at the same time, rather than independently -- a scenario which is consistent with gas-rich mergers being responsible for concurrent AGN activity. This conclusion is supported by the recent NANOGrav Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements, whose upper limits on the stochastic gravitational wave strain amplitude lie below those expected from extrapolating the dual AGN fraction. The results indicate either a 'stalling' of the binaries at the separations probed by NANOGrav, or rapid gas-driven inspirals.</description>
