      <title>The Potential of Erroneous Outbound Traffic Analysis to Unveil Silent Internal Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive measurement has traditionally focused on inbound traffic to detect malicious activity, based on the assumption that threats originate externally. In this paper, we offer a complementary perspective by examining outbound traffic, and argue that a narrow subset -- what we term erroneous outbound traffic -- is a lighter and revealing yet overlooked data source for identifying a broad range of security threats and network problems. This traffic consists of packets sent by internal hosts that either receive no response, trigger ICMP errors, or are ICMP error messages themselves generated in response to unsolicited requests. To demonstrate its potential, we collect and analyse erroneous traffic from a large network, uncovering a variety of previously unnoticed issues, including misconfigurations, obsolete deployments and compromised hosts.</description>

      <title>ReAct: Reflection Attack Mitigation For Asymmetric Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplification Reflection Distributed Denial-of-Service (AR-DDoS) attacks remain a formidable threat, exploiting stateless protocols to flood victims with illegitimate traffic. Recent advances have enabled data-plane defenses against such attacks, but existing solutions typically assume symmetric routing and are limited to a single switch. These assumptions fail in modern networks where asymmetry is common, resulting in dropped legitimate responses and persistent connectivity issues. This paper presents ReAct, an in-network defense for AR-DDoS that is robust to asymmetry. ReAct performs request-response correlation across switches using programmable data planes and a sliding-window of Bloom filters. To handle asymmetric traffic, ReAct introduces a data-plane-based request forwarding mechanism, enabling switches to validate responses even when paths differ. ReAct can automatically adapt to routing changes with minimal intervention, ensuring continued protection even in dynamic network environments. We implemented ReAct on both a P4 interpreter and NVIDIAs Bluefield-3, demonstrating its applicability across multiple platforms. Evaluation results show that ReAct filters nearly all attack traffic without dropping legitimate responses-even under high-volume attacks and asymmetry. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, ReAct achieves significantly lower false positives. To our knowledge, ReAct is the first data-plane AR-DDoS defense that supports dynamic, cross-switch collaboration, making it uniquely suitable for deployment in networks with asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude Satellite-AAV Collaborative Joint Mobile Edge Computing and Data Collection via Diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of satellite and autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) communications has become essential for the scenarios requiring both wide coverage and rapid deployment, particularly in remote or disaster-stricken areas where the terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable. Furthermore, emerging applications increasingly demand simultaneous mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) capabilities within the same aerial network. However, jointly optimizing these operations in heterogeneous satellite-AAV systems presents significant challenges due to limited on-board resources and competing demands under dynamic channel conditions. In this work, we investigate a satellite-AAV-enabled joint MEC-DC system where these platforms collaborate to serve ground devices (GDs). Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the average MEC end-to-end delay and AAV energy consumption while maximizing the collected data. Since the formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose a Q-weighted variational policy optimization-based joint AAV movement control, GD association, offloading decision, and bandwidth allocation (QAGOB) approach. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem as an action space-transformed Markov decision process to adapt the variable action dimensions and hybrid action space. Subsequently, QAGOB leverages the multi-modal generation capacities of diffusion models to optimize policies and can achieve better sample efficiency while controlling the diffusion costs during training. Simulation results show that QAGOB outperforms five other benchmarks, including traditional DRL and diffusion-based DRL algorithms. Furthermore, the MEC-DC joint optimization achieves significant advantages when compared to the separate optimization of MEC and DC.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Solution for Node Mobility Problems in NDN-Based Massive LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing investment in the deployment of massive commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations to provide global Internet connectivity. These constellations, now equipped with inter-satellite links, can serve as low-latency Internet backbones, requiring LEO satellites to act not only as access nodes for ground stations, but also as in-orbit core routers. Due to their high velocity and the resulting frequent handovers of ground gateways, LEO networks highly stress mobility procedures at both the sender and receiver endpoints. On the other hand, a growing trend in networking is the use of technologies based on the Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm for servicing IoT networks and sensor networks in general, as its addressing, storage, and security mechanisms are usually a good match for IoT needs. Furthermore, ICN networks possess additional characteristics that are beneficial for the massive LEO scenario. For instance, the mobility of the receiver is helped by the inherent data-forwarding procedures in their architectures. However, the mobility of the senders remains an open problem. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to the mobility problem for massive LEO constellations using the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture, as it is probably the most mature ICN proposal. Our solution includes a scalable method to relate content to ground gateways and a way to address traffic to the gateway that does not require cooperation from the network routing algorithm. Moreover, our solution works without requiring modifications to the actual NDN protocol itself, so it is easy to test and deploy. Our results indicate that, for long enough handover lengths, traffic losses are negligible even for ground stations with just one satellite in sight.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Carbon Footprint of Virtual Meetings: A Quantitative Analysis of Camera Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the carbon emissions related to data consumption during video calls, focusing on the impact of having the camera on versus off. Addresses the energy efficiency and carbon footprint of digital communication tools. The study is used to quantify the real reduction in environmental impact claimed in several articles when people choose to turn off their camera during meetings. The experiment was carried out using a 4G connection via a cell phone to understand the varying data transfer associated with videos. The findings indicate that turning the camera off can halve data consumption therefore carbon emissions, particularly on mobile networks, and conclude with recommendations to optimize data usage and reduce environmental impact during calls.</description>

      <title>SecureDyn-FL: A Robust Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Intrusion Detection in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across domains such as smart homes, industrial control systems, and healthcare networks has significantly expanded the attack surface for cyber threats, including botnet-driven distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), malware injection, and data exfiltration. Conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) face critical challenges like privacy, scalability, and robustness when applied in such heterogeneous IoT environments. To address these issues, we propose SecureDyn-FL, a comprehensive and robust privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework tailored for intrusion detection in IoT networks. SecureDyn-FL is designed to simultaneously address multiple security dimensions in FL-based IDS: (1) poisoning detection through dynamic temporal gradient auditing, (2) privacy protection against inference and eavesdropping attacks through secure aggregation, and (3) adaptation to heterogeneous non-IID data via personalized learning. The framework introduces three core contributions: (i) a dynamic temporal gradient auditing mechanism that leverages Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) to detect stealthy and adaptive poisoning attacks, (ii) an optimized privacy-preserving aggregation scheme based on transformed additive ElGamal encryption with adaptive pruning and quantization for secure and efficient communication, and (iii) a dual-objective personalized learning strategy that improves model adaptation under non-IID data using logit-adjusted loss. Extensive experiments on the N-BaIoT dataset under both IID and non-IID settings, including scenarios with up to 50% adversarial clients, demonstrate that SecureDyn-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL-based IDS defenses.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Empowered Intent-Based Networking for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition towards sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks necessitates autonomous orchestration mechanisms capable of translating high-level operational intents into executable network configurations. Existing approaches to Intent-Based Networking (IBN) rely upon either rule-based systems that struggle with linguistic variation or end-to-end neural models that lack interpretability and fail to enforce operational constraints. This paper presents a hierarchical multi-agent framework where Large Language Model (LLM) based agents autonomously decompose natural language intents, consult domain-specific specialists, and synthesise technically feasible network slice configurations through iterative reasoning-action (ReAct) cycles. The proposed architecture employs an orchestrator agent coordinating two specialist agents, i.e., Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network agents, via ReAct-style reasoning, grounded in structured network state representations. Experimental evaluation across diverse benchmark scenarios shows that the proposed system outperforms rule-based systems and direct LLM prompting, with architectural principles applicable to Open RAN (O-RAN) deployments. The results also demonstrate that whilst contemporary LLMs possess general telecommunications knowledge, network automation requires careful prompt engineering to encode context-dependent decision thresholds, advancing autonomous orchestration capabilities for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>A Protocol-Aware P4 Pipeline for MQTT Security and Anomaly Mitigation in Edge IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MQTT is the dominant lightweight publish--subscribe protocol for IoT deployments, yet edge security remains inadequate. Cloud-based intrusion detection systems add latency that is unsuitable for real-time control, while CPU-bound firewalls and generic SDN controllers lack MQTT awareness to enforce session validation, topic-based authorization, and behavioral anomaly detection. We propose a P4-based data-plane enforcement scheme for protocol-aware MQTT security and anomaly detection at the network edge. The design combines parser-safe MQTT header extraction with session-order validation, byte-level topic-prefix authorization with per-client rate limiting and soft-cap enforcement, and lightweight anomaly detection based on KeepAlive and Remaining Length screening with clone-to-CPU diagnostics. The scheme leverages stateful primitives in BMv2 (registers, meters, direct counters) to enable runtime policy adaptation with minimal per-packet latency. Experiments on a Mininet/BMv2 testbed demonstrate high policy enforcement accuracy (99.8%, within 95% CI), strong anomaly detection sensitivity (98\% true-positive rate), and high delivery &gt;99.9% for 100--5~kpps; 99.8% at 10~kpps; 99.6\% at 16~kpps) with sub-millisecond per-packet latency. These results show that protocol-aware MQTT filtering can be efficiently realized in the programmable data plane, providing a practical foundation for edge IoT security. Future work will validate the design on production P4 hardware and integrate machine learning--based threshold adaptation.</description>

      <title>TeeMAF: A TEE-Based Mutual Attestation Framework for On-Chain and Off-Chain Functions in Blockchain DApps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to growing concerns about data security and user privacy in the interactions within distributed systems. Decentralized Applications (DApps) in distributed systems consist of on-chain and off-chain functions, where on-chain functions are smart contracts running in the blockchain network, while off-chain functions operate outside the blockchain. Since smart contracts cannot access off-chain information, they cannot verify whether the off-chain functions, i.e. the software components, they interact with have been tampered or not. As a result, establishing mutual trust between the on-chain smart contracts and the off-chain functions remains a significant challenge. To address the challenge, this paper introduces TeeMAF, a generic framework for mutual attestation between on-chain and off-chain functions, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), specifically Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), SCONE (a TEE container on top of Intel SGX), and remote attestation technologies. This ensures that the deployed off-chain functions of a DApp execute in a provably secure computing environment and achieve mutual attestation with the interacting on-chain functions. Through a security analysis of TeeMAF, the reliability of deployed DApps can be verified, ensuring their correct execution. Furthermore, based on this framework, this paper proposes a decentralized resource orchestration platform (a specific DApp) for deploying applications over untrusted environments. The system is implemented on Ethereum and benchmarked using Hyperledger Caliper. Performance evaluation focusing on throughput and latency demonstrates that, compared to platforms without a mutual attestation scheme, the performance overhead remains within an acceptable range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming cellular networks aim to improve the efficiency and flexibility of mobile networks by incorporating various technologies, such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Network Slicing (NS). There exist open-source projects that implement components of different cellular generations. In this paper, we elaborate on how to use these open-source projects to realize a flexible and extendable testbed for conducting experiments on the future generation of cellular networks. In particular, a Cloud-Native Cellular Network Framework (CN2F) is presented, which uses OpenAirInterface's codebase to generate cellular Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and deploys Kubernetes to disperse and manage them among multiple worker nodes. Moreover, CN2F leverages ONOS and Mininet to emulate the effect of the IP transport networks in the fronthaul and backhaul of real-world cellular networks. Using CN2F, we implement different network scenarios, including Edge Computing (EC), Cloud Computing (CC), and Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing, to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed testbed for academia and industrial Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities.</description>

      <title>Solutions for Sustainable and Resilient Communication Infrastructure in Disaster Relief and Management Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As natural disasters become more frequent and severe, ensuring a resilient communications infrastructure is of paramount importance for effective disaster response and recovery. This disaster-resilient infrastructure should also respond to sustainability goals by providing an energy-efficient and economically feasible network that is accessible to everyone. This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the technological solutions and strategies necessary to build and maintain resilient communications networks that can withstand and quickly recover from disaster scenarios. The paper starts with a survey of existing literature and related reviews to establish a solid foundation, followed by an overview of the global landscape of disaster communications and power supply management. We then introduce the key enablers of communications and energy resource technologies to support communications infrastructure, examining emerging trends that improve the resilience of these systems. Pre-disaster planning is emphasized as a critical phase where proactive communication and energy supply strategies can significantly mitigate the impact of disasters. We explore the essential technologies for disaster response, focusing on real-time communications and energy solutions that support rapid deployment and coordination in times of crisis. The paper presents post-disaster communication and energy management planning for effective rescue and evacuation operations. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey are also summarized for each disaster phase. This is followed by an analysis of existing vendor products and services as well as standardization efforts and ongoing projects that contribute to the development of resilient infrastructures. A detailed case study of the Turkiye earthquakes is presented to illustrate the practical application of these technologies and strategies.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient UAV-assisted LoRa Gateways: A Multi-Agent Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) networks continue to grow, the number of connected devices is rapidly increasing, along with their energy demands, creating challenges for resource management and sustainability. Energy-efficient communication, particularly for power-limited IoT devices, is therefore a key research focus. In this paper, we study Long Range (LoRa) networks supported by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an uplink data collection scenario. Our objective is to maximize system energy efficiency by jointly optimizing transmission power, spreading factor, bandwidth, and user association. To address this challenging problem, we first model it as a partially observable stochastic game (POSG) to account for dynamic channel conditions, end device mobility, and partial observability at each UAV. We then propose a two-stage solution: a channel-aware matching algorithm for ED-UAV association and a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) framework for resource allocation under centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional off-policy and on-policy MARL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Systems for Battery Management: A Five-Tier Digital Twin Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As digital twin technologies are increasingly incorporated into battery management systems to meet the growing need for transparent and lifecycle-aware operation, existing battery digital twins still suffer from fragmented operational processes and lack an architectural perspective to coordinate modeling, inference, and decision-making throughout the battery lifecycle. To this end, we develop a unified five-tier battery digital twin framework that integrates key functionalities into a coherent pipeline and facilitates a clearer architectural understanding of digital twins. The five-tier comprises geometric modeling, descriptive analytics, physics-informed prediction, prescriptive optimization, and autonomous control. In quantitative evaluation, the resulting architecture achieves high-fidelity multi-physics calibration with 0.92\% voltage and 0.18\% temperature prediction error, and provides state-of-health estimation with 1.09\% MAPE and calibrated uncertainty. As the first battery digital twin system empowered by the NVIDIA ecosystem with physics-AI technologies, our proposed five-tier framework shifts battery management from reactive protection to an interpretable, predictive, and autonomous paradigm, paving the path to develop next-generation battery management and energy management systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of 1Q, the first wireless generation of integrated classical and quantum communication. 1Q features quantum base stations (QBSs) that support entanglement distribution via free-space optical links alongside traditional radio communications. Key new components include quantum cells, quantum user equipment (QUEs), and hybrid resource allocation spanning classical time-frequency and quantum entanglement domains. Several application scenarios are discussed and illustrated through system design requirements for quantum key distribution, blind quantum computing, and distributed quantum sensing. A range of unique quantum constraints are identified, including decoherence timing, fidelity requirements, and the interplay between quantum and classical error probabilities. Protocol adaptations extend cellular connection management to incorporate entanglement generation, distribution, and handover procedures, expanding the Quantum Internet to the cellular wireless.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Monitoring and Compensation of Transceiver IQ Imbalance by Multi-dimensional Architecture for Dual-Polarization 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a low-complexity multi-dimensional architecture for IQ imbalance compensation is proposed, which reduces the effects of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance. The architecture use a transceiver IQ skew estimation structure to compensate for IQ skew, and then use a low-complexity MIMO equalizer to compensate for IQ amplitude/phase imbalance. In the transceiver IQ skew estimation structure, the receiver(RX) IQ skew is estimated by Gardner's phase detector, and the transmitter TX skew is estimated by finding the value that yields the lowest equalizer error. The low-complexity MIMO equalizer consists of a complex-valued MIMO (CV-MIMO) and a two-layer multimodulus algorithm real-valued MIMO (TMMA-RV-MIMO), which employ a butterfly and a non-butterfly structure, respectively. The CV-MIMO is used to perform polarization demultiplexing and the TMMA-RV-MIMO equalizes each of the two polarizations. In addition, the TMMA-RV-MIMO can recovery the carrier phase. A 100 km transmission simulation and experiment with 36 Gbaud dual-polarization 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-16QAM) signals showed that, with the TX/RX IQ skew estimation, the estimation error is less than 0.9/0.25 ps. The low-complexity MIMO equalizer can tolerate 0.1 TX IQ amplitude imbalance and 5 degrees at a 0.3 dB Q-factor penalty. The number of real multiplications is reduced by 55% compared with conventional cases in total.</description>

      <title>Synecdoche: Efficient and Accurate In-Network Traffic Classification via Direct Packet Sequential Pattern Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic classification on programmable data plane holds great promise for line-rate processing, with methods evolving from per-packet to flow-level analysis for higher accuracy. However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an "offline discovery, online matching" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage. The source code of Synecdoche is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</description>

      <title>Utility Maximization in Wireless Backhaul Networks with Service Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing utility in wireless backhaul networks, where utility is a function of satisfied service level agreements (SLAs), defined in terms of end-to-end packet delays and instantaneous throughput. We model backhaul networks as a tree topology and show that SLAs can be satisfied by constructing link schedules with bounded inter-scheduling times, an NP-complete problem known as pinwheel scheduling. For symmetric tree topologies, we show that simple round-robin schedules can be optimal under certain conditions. In the general case, we develop a mixed-integer program that optimizes over the set of admission decisions and pinwheel schedules. We develop a novel pinwheel scheduling algorithm, which significantly expands the set of schedules that can be found in polynomial time over the state of the art. Using conditions from this algorithm, we develop a scalable, distributed approach to solve the utility-maximization problem, with complexity that is linear in the depth of the tree.</description>

      <title>Certificates in P and Subquadratic-Time Computation of Radius, Diameter, and all Eccentricities in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.04660v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of fine-grained complexity, we investigate the notion of certificate enabling faster polynomial-time algorithms. We specifically target radius (minimum eccentricity), diameter (maximum eccentricity), and all-eccentricity computations for which quadratic-time lower bounds are known under plausible conjectures. In each case, we introduce a notion of certificate as a specific set of nodes from which appropriate bounds on all eccentricities can be derived in subquadratic time when this set has sublinear size. The existence of small certificates is a barrier against SETH-based lower bounds for these problems. We indeed prove that for graph classes with small certificates, there exist randomized subquadratic-time algorithms for computing the radius, the diameter, and all eccentricities respectively. Moreover, these notions of certificates are tightly related to algorithms probing the graph through one-to-all distance queries and allow to explain the efficiency of practical radius and diameter algorithms from the literature. Our formalization enables a novel primal-dual analysis of a classical approach for diameter computation that leads to algorithms for radius, diameter and all eccentricities with theoretical guarantees with respect to certain graph parameters. This is complemented by experimental results on various types of real-world graphs showing that these parameters appear to be low in practice. Finally, we obtain refined results for several graph classes.</description>

      <title>Canopy: Property-Driven Learning for Congestion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based congestion controllers offer better adaptability compared to traditional heuristics. However, the unreliability of learning techniques can cause learning-based controllers to behave poorly, creating a need for formal guarantees. While methods for formally verifying learned congestion controllers exist, these methods offer binary feedback that cannot optimize the controller toward better behavior. We improve this state-of-the-art via Canopy, a new property-driven framework that integrates learning with formal reasoning in the learning loop. Canopy uses novel quantitative certification with an abstract interpreter to guide the training process, rewarding models, and evaluating robust and safe model performance on worst-case inputs. Our evaluation demonstrates that unlike state-of-the-art learned controllers, Canopy-trained controllers provide both adaptability and worst-case reliability across a range of network conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Paths: a Quantum Walk approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum switch, a process enabling a coherent superposition of different orders of quantum channels, has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable noiseless communications through noisy channels, such as entanglement-breaking channels. However, its practical implementation and scalability remain challenging. In contrast, the spatial superposition of quantum channels is more accessible experimentally and has been shown to enhance channel capacity, although it does not match the performance of the quantum switch. In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results demonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to the spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output of a quantum switch. These findings suggest a promising and more feasible route to emulate the quantum switch, offering both practical advantages and interpretative clarity.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Data Center Architectures: A Performance and Scalability Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable distributed quantum computing (DQC) has motivated the design of multiple quantum data-center (QDC) architectures that overcome the limitations of single quantum processors through modular interconnection. While these architectures adopt fundamentally different design philosophies, their relative performance under realistic quantum hardware constraints remains poorly understood.
  In this paper, we present a systematic benchmarking study of four representative QDC architectures-QFly, BCube, Clos, and Fat-Tree-quantifying their impact on distributed quantum circuit execution latency, resource contention, and scalability. Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways. Together, these insights provide quantitative guidance for the design of scalable and high-performance quantum data-center architectures for DQC.</description>
