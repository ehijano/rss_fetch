      <title>Learning to Reconfigure: Using Device Status to Select the Right Constrained Coding Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of data revolution, a modern storage~or transmission system typically requires different levels of protection. For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Communication with Massive Movable Antennas: An Electrostatic Equilibrium Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale position-reconfigurable antennas have opened up new dimensions to effectively utilize the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) of wireless channels. However, the deployment of existing antenna placement schemes is primarily hindered by their limited scalability and frequently overlooked near-field effects in large-scale antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna placement approach tailored for near-field massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, which effectively exploits the spatial DoFs to enhance spectral efficiency. For that purpose, we first reformulate the antenna placement problem in the angular domain, resulting in a weighted Fekete problem. We then derive the optimality condition and reveal that the {optimal} antenna placement is in principle an electrostatic equilibrium problem. To further reduce the computational complexity of numerical optimization, we propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based framework to efficiently solve the equilibrium problem. In particular, the optimal antenna positions are characterized by the roots of the polynomial solutions to specific ODEs in the normalized angular domain. By simply adopting a two-step eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) approach, the optimal antenna positions can be efficiently obtained. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis when the antenna size tends to infinity, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently harnesses the spatial DoFs of near-field channels with prominent gains in spectral efficiency and maintains robustness against system parameter mismatches. In addition, the derived asymptotic closed-form {solution} closely approaches the theoretical optimum across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Latency-Optimal Cache-aided Multicast Streaming via Forward-Backward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cellular network equipped with cache-enabled base-stations (BSs) leveraging an orthogonal multipoint multicast (OMPMC) streaming scheme. The network operates in a time-slotted fashion to serve content-requesting users by streaming cached files. The users being unsatisfied by the multicat streaming face a delivery outage, implying that they will remain interested in their preference at the next time-slot, which leads to a forward dynamics on the user preference. To design a latency-optimal streaming policy, the dynamics of latency is properly modeled and included in the learning procedure. We show that this dynamics surprisingly represents a backward dynamics. The combination of problem's forward and backward dynamics then develops a forward-backward Markov decision process (FB-MDP) that fully captures the network evolution across time. This FB-MDP necessitates usage of a forward-backward multi-objective reinforcement learning (FB-MORL) algorithm to optimize the expected latency as well as other performance metrics of interest including the overall outage probability and total resource consumption. Simulation results show the merit of proposed FB-MORL algorithm in finding a promising dynamic cache policy.</description>

      <title>On the Ergodic Capacity for SIM-Aided Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a novel closed-form lower bound on the ergodic capacity of holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems enhanced by stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) under Rayleigh fading conditions. The proposed expression is valid for systems with a finite number of antennas and SIM elements and exhibits tightness throughout the whole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive low-SNR analysis, offering meaningful observations on how key system parameters influence the capacity performance.</description>

      <title>Composition Theorems for f-Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "f differential privacy" (fDP) is a recent definition for privacy privacy which can offer improved predictions of "privacy loss". It has been used to analyse specific privacy mechanisms, such as the popular Gaussian mechanism. In this paper we show how fDP's foundation in statistical hypothesis testing implies equivalence to the channel model of Quantitative Information Flow. We demonstrate this equivalence by a Galois connection between two partially ordered sets. This equivalence enables novel general composition theorems for fDP, supporting improved analysis for complex privacy designs.</description>

      <title>Near-field Target Localization: Effect of Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prior works on near-field target localization have mostly assumed ideal hardware models and thus suffer from two limitations in practice. First, extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) usually face a variety of hardware impairments (HIs) that may introduce unknown phase and/or amplitude errors. Second, the existing block coordinate descent (BCD)-based methods for joint estimation of the HI indicator, channel gain, angle, and range may induce considerable target localization error when the target is very close to the XL-array. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a new three-phase HI-aware near-field localization method, by efficiently detecting faulty antennas and estimating the positions of targets. Specifically, we first determine faulty antennas by using compressed sensing (CS) methods and improve detection accuracy based on coarse target localization. Then, a dedicated phase calibration method is designed to correct phase errors induced by detected faulty antennas. Subsequently, an efficient near-field localization method is devised to accurately estimate the positions of targets based on the full XL-array with phase calibration. Additionally, we resort to the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) to quantify the performance loss caused by HIs. Last, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the localization errors as compared to various benchmark schemes, especially for the case with a short target range and/or a high fault probability.</description>

      <title>Rational Inattention: A Bayesian Predictive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recast rational inattention as a Bayesian predictive decision problem in which the agent reports a predictive distribution and is evaluated by a proper local scoring rule. This yields a direct link to rate-distortion theory and shows that Shannon entropy emerges endogenously as the honest local utility for predictive refinement. Bernardo's characterization of proper local scoring rules together with Shannon's amalgamation invariance imply that the logarithmic score, and hence mutual information, is the unique information measure consistent with coherent prediction under refinement of the state space. Information costs, therefore, need not be assumed: they arise as expected predictive utility. Within this framework we establish a supported complete-class result: the optimal policies are Gibbs-Boltzmann channels, with the classical rational-inattention family recovered as a special case. Canonical models appear as geometric specializations of the same structure, including multinomial logit (and IIA) under entropic regularization, James-Stein shrinkage as optimal capacity allocation in Gaussian learning, and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control as the capacity-optimal Gaussian channel. Overall, the Bayesian predictive formulation reframes bounded rationality as an optimal design principle: finite information capacity is an endogenous solution to a well-posed predictive problem, and behaviors often attributed to cognitive frictions, soft choice, regularization, sparsity, and screening arise as rational responses to the geometry of predictive refinement.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Perspective on Agentic System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\times$ more accurate, $4.6\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\%$ of API costs.</description>

      <title>Conserved active information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce conserved active information $I^\oplus$, a symmetric extension of active information that quantifies net information gain/loss across the entire search space, respecting No-Free-Lunch conservation. Through Bernoulli and uniform-baseline examples, we show $I^\oplus$ reveals regimes hidden from KL divergence, such as when strong knowledge reduces global disorder. Such regimes are proven formally under uniform baseline, distinguishing disorder (increasing mild knowledge from order-imposing strong knowledge. We further illustrate these regimes with examples from Markov chains and cosmological fine-tuning. This resolves a longstanding critique of active information while enabling applications in search, optimization, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality and Multiplicative Structures on Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes have attracted intense interest due to their advantageous properties for realizing efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincar\'e duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.
  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincar\'e duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\mathrm{C}Z}=\Theta(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes. Mathematically, our results are built on establishing the equivalence between sheaf cohomology in the derived-functor sense, \v{C}ech cohomology, and the cohomology of sheaf codes, thereby introducing new mathematical tools into quantum coding theory.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the capacity limits for quantum secret sharing (QSS). The goal of a QSS scheme is to distribute a quantum secret among multiple participants, such that only authorized parties can recover it through collaboration, while no information can be obtained without such collaboration. Following the approach of Zou et al. (2015) on classical secret sharing, we introduce an information-theoretic model for the rate analysis of QSS and its relation to compound quantum channels. We establish a regularized characterization for the QSS capacity, and determine the capacity for QSS with dephasing noise.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Arimoto-Blahut Algorithm for Capacity Region Calculation of Gaussian Vector Broadcast Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the computation of the capacity region of a continuous, Gaussian vector broadcast channel (BC) with covariance matrix constraints. Since the decision variables of the corresponding optimization problem are Gaussian distributed, they can be characterized by a finite number of parameters. Consequently, we develop new Blahut-Arimoto (BA)-type algorithms that can compute the capacity without discretizing the channel. First, by exploiting projection and an approximation of the Lagrange multiplier, which are introduced to handle certain positive semidefinite constraints in the optimization formulation, we develop the Gaussian BA algorithm with projection (GBA-P). Then, we demonstrate that one of the subproblems arising from the alternating updates admits a closed-form solution. Based on this result, we propose the Gaussian BA algorithm with alternating updates (GBA-A) and establish its convergence guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the GBA-P algorithm to compute the capacity region of the Gaussian vector BC with both private and common messages. All the proposed algorithms are parameter-free. Lastly, we present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the convertible code with locally repairable property. We present an improved lower bound on access cost associated with $(r,\delta)$. Then, we provide a general construction of convertible codes with optimal access cost which shows that those codes can be with super-linear length or maximum repairable property. Additionally, employing the known locally repairable codes with super-linear length or maximum repairable property, we provide explicit constructions of convertible codes with super-linear length or maximum repairable property.</description>

Abstract: Traditional asymptotic information-theoretic studies of the fundamental limits of wireless communication systems primarily rely on some ideal assumptions, such as infinite blocklength and vanishing error probability. While these assumptions enable tractable mathematical characterizations, they fail to capture the stringent requirements of some emerging next-generation wireless applications, such as ultra-reliable low latency communication and ultra-massive machine type communication, in which it is required to support a much wider range of features including short-packet communication, extremely low latency, and/or low energy consumption. To better support such applications, it is important to consider finite-blocklength information theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the advances in this field, followed by a discussion on the open questions. Specifically, we commence with the fundamental limits of source coding in the non-asymptotic regime, with a particular focus on lossless and lossy compression in point-to-point~(P2P) and multiterminal cases. Next, we discuss the fundamental limits of channel coding in P2P channels, multiple access channels, and emerging massive access channels. We further introduce recent advances in joint source and channel coding, highlighting its considerable performance advantage over separate source and channel coding in the non-asymptotic regime. In each part, we review various non-asymptotic achievability bounds, converse bounds, and approximations, as well as key ideas behind them, which are essential for providing engineering insights into the design of future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Signal Prediction by Derivative Samples from the Past via Perfect Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03471</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates signal prediction through the perfect reconstruction of signals from shift-invariant spaces using nonuniform samples of both the signal and its derivatives. The key advantage of derivative sampling is its ability to reduce the sampling rate. We derive a sampling formula based on periodic nonuniform sampling (PNS) sets with derivatives in a shift-invariant space. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for such a set to form a complete interpolating sequence (CIS) of order $r-1$. This framework is then used to develop an efficient approximation scheme in a shift-invariant space generated by a compactly supported function. Building on this, we propose a prediction algorithm that reconstructs a signal from a finite number of past derivative samples using the derived perfect reconstruction formula. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through practical examples involving cubic splines and the Daubechies scaling function of order 3.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Receiver Quantization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate information-theoretic limits and design of communication under receiver quantization. Unlike most existing studies, this work is more focused on the impact of resolution reduction from high to low. We consider a standard transceiver architecture, which includes i.i.d. complex Gaussian codebook at the transmitter, and a symmetric quantizer cascaded with a nearest neighbor decoder at the receiver. Employing the generalized mutual information (GMI), an achievable rate under general quantization rules is obtained in an analytical form, which shows that the rate loss due to quantization is $\log\left(1+\gamma\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where $\gamma$ is determined by thresholds and levels of the quantizer. Based on this result, the performance under uniform receiver quantization is analyzed comprehensively. We show that the front-end gain control, which determines the loading factor of quantization, has an increasing impact on performance as the resolution decreases. In particular, we prove that the unique loading factor that minimizes the MSE also maximizes the GMI, and the corresponding irreducible rate loss is given by $\log\left(1+\mathsf {mmse}\cdot\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where mmse is the minimum MSE normalized by the variance of quantizer input, and is equal to the minimum of $\gamma$. A geometrical interpretation for the optimal uniform quantization at the receiver is further established. Moreover, by asymptotic analysis, we characterize the impact of biased gain control, showing how small rate losses decay to zero and providing rate approximations under large bias. From asymptotic expressions of the optimal loading factor and mmse, approximations and several per-bit rules for performance are also provided. Finally we discuss more types of receiver quantization and show that the consistency between achievable rate maximization and MSE minimization does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Linear codes over a mixed-alphabet ring and their Gray images with applications to projective and locally repairable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $m \geq 2$ be an integer, and let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of prime power order $q.$ Let $\mathcal{R}=\frac{\mathbb{F}_q[u]}{\langle u^2 \rangle}\times \mathbb{F}_q$ be the mixed-alphabet ring, where $\frac{\mathbb{F}_q[u]}{\langle u^2 \rangle}$ is the quasi-Galois ring with maximal ideal $\langle u\rangle$ of nilpotency index $2$ and residue field $\mathbb{F}_q.$ In this paper, we construct four infinite families of linear codes over the ring $\frac{\mathbb{F}_q[u]}{\langle u^2 \rangle}$ whose defining sets are certain non-empty subsets of $\mathcal{R}^m$ associated with three simplicial complexes of $\mathbb{F}_q^m,$ each possessing a single maximal element. We explicitly determine the parameters and Lee weight distributions of these codes. We also study their Gray images and identify several infinite families of few-weight codes over $\mathbb{F}_q,$ as well as an infinite family of minimal, near-Griesmer and distance-optimal codes over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ We also observe that their Gray images are self-orthogonal codes for $q=2$ or $3.$ We determine spanning matrices of these codes. Leveraging this result, we provide two constructions of infinite families of projective few-weight codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with new parameters. As an application of our newly constructed minimal codes over $\mathbb{F}_q,$ we examine the minimal access structures of Masseys secret sharing schemes based on their duals and determine the number of dictatorial participants in these schemes. Finally, we investigate the locality properties of our newly constructed projective codes and show that these codes have locality either $2$ or $3.$ As a consequence, we obtain four infinite families of $q$-ary locally repairable codes (LRCs) with locality $2,$ and two infinite families of binary LRCs with locality $3.$</description>

      <title>Quantum accessible information and classical entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. We show that the optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed. Via the optimality criterion, this suggests also a proof of the conjecture concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids put forward in [2].</description>

      <title>Beyond Trade-offs: A Unified Framework for Privacy, Robustness, and Communication Efficiency in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework designed to jointly provide differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and communication efficiency. Central to our approach is the concept of robust-compatible compression, which allows reducing the bi-directional communication overhead without undermining the robustness of the aggregation. We instantiate our framework as RobAJoL, which integrates the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL)-based compression mechanism with robust averaging for robustness. Our theoretical analysis establishes the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging, ensuring that RobAJoL maintains robustness guarantees, satisfies DP, and substantially reduces communication overhead. We further present simulation results on CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, and FEMNIST, validating our theoretical claims. We compare RobAJoL with a state-of-the-art communication-efficient and robust FL scheme augmented with DP for a fair comparison, demonstrating that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.</description>
