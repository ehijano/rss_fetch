      <title>On categories with arbitrary 2-cell structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a category is equipped with a 2-cell structure it becomes a sesquicategory but not necessarily a 2-category. It is widely accepted that the latter property is equivalent to the middle interchange law. However, little attention has been given to the study of the category of all 2-cell structures (seen as sesquicategories with a fixed underlying base category) other than as a generalization for 2-categories. The purpose of this work is to highlight the significance of such a study, which can prove valuable in identifying intrinsic features pertaining to the base category. These ideas are expanded upon through the guiding example of the category of monoids. Specifically, when a monoid is viewed as a one-object category, its 2-cell structures resemble semibimodules.</description>

      <title>Copy-composition for probabilistic graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In probabilistic modelling, joint distributions are often of more interest than their marginals, but the standard composition of stochastic channels is defined by marginalization. Recently, the notion of 'copy-composition' was introduced in order to circumvent this problem and express the chain rule of the relative entropy fibrationally, but while that goal was achieved, copy-composition lacked a satisfactory origin story. Here, we supply such a story for two standard probabilistic tools: directed and undirected graphical models. We explain that (directed) Bayesian networks may be understood as "stochastic terms" of product type, in which context copy-composition amounts to a pull-push operation. Likewise, we show that (undirected) factor graphs compose by copy-composition. In each case, our construction yields a double fibration of decorated (co)spans. Along the way, we introduce a useful bifibration of measure kernels, to provide semantics for the notion of stochastic term, which allows us to generalize probabilistic modelling from product to dependent types.</description>

      <title>Structured Active Inference (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce structured active inference, a large generalization and formalization of active inference using the tools of categorical systems theory. We cast generative models formally as systems "on an interface", with the latter being a compositional abstraction of the usual notion of Markov blanket; agents are then 'controllers' for their generative models, formally dual to them. This opens the active inference landscape to new horizons, such as: agents with structured interfaces (e.g. with 'mode-dependence', or that interact with computer APIs); agents that can manage other agents; and 'meta-agents', that use active inference to change their (internal or external) structure. With structured interfaces, we also gain structured ('typed') policies, which are amenable to formal verification, an important step towards safe artificial agents. Moreover, we can make use of categorical logic to describe express agents' goals as formal predicates, whose satisfaction may be dependent on the interaction context. This points towards powerful compositional tools to constrain and control self-organizing ensembles of agents.</description>

      <title>Free extensivity via distributivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the canonical pseudodistributive law between various free limit completion pseudomonads and the free coproduct completion pseudomonad. When the class of limits includes pullbacks, we show that this consideration leads to notions of extensive categories. More precisely, we show that extensive categories with pullbacks and infinitary lextensive categories are the pseudoalgebras for the pseudomonads resulting from the pseudodistributive laws. Moreover, we introduce the notion of doubly-infinitary lextensive category, and we establish that the freely generated such categories are cartesian closed. From this result, we further deduce that, in freely generated infinitary lextensive categories, the objects with a finite number of connected components are exponentiable. We conclude our work with remarks on descent theoretical aspects of this work, along with results concerning non-canonical isomorphisms, and relationship with other work.</description>

      <title>Lax comma categories: cartesian closedness, extensivity, topologicity, and descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of lax comma categories over a base category $X$, focusing on topologicity, extensivity, cartesian closedness, and descent. We establish that the forgetful functor from $\mathsf{Cat}//X$ to $\mathsf{Cat}$ is topological if and only if $X$ is large-complete. Moreover, we provide conditions for $\mathsf{Cat}//X$ to be complete, cocomplete, extensive and cartesian closed. We analyze descent in $\mathsf{Cat}//X$ and identify necessary conditions for effective descent morphisms. Our findings contribute to the literature on lax comma categories and provide a foundation for further research in 2-dimensional Janelidze's Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Relative elegance and cartesian cubes with one connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14801v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Quillen equivalence between the Kan-Quillen model structure and a model structure, derived from a cubical model of homotopy type theory, on the category of cartesian cubical sets with one connection. We thereby identify a second model structure which both constructively models homotopy type theory and presents infinity-groupoids, the first example being the equivariant cartesian model of Awodey-Cavallo-Coquand-Riehl-Sattler.</description>

      <title>Approximation Theory and Elementary Submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \emph{Approximation Theory} uses nicely-behaved subcategories to understand entire categories, just as projective modules are used to approximate arbitrary modules in classical homological algebra. We use set-theoretic \emph{elementary submodel arguments} to give new, short proofs of well-known theorems in approximation theory, sometimes with stronger results.</description>
