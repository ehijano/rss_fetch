      <title>Linearizing holomorphic functions on operator spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of completely bounded holomorphic functions defined on the open unit ball of an operator space. We endow the set of these functions with an operator space structure, and in the scalar-valued case we identify an operator space predual for it which is a noncommutative version of Mujica's predual for the space of bounded holomorphic functions and satisfies similar properties. In particular, our predual is a free holomorphic operator space in the sense that it satisfies a linearization property for vector-valued completely bounded holomorphic functions. Additionally, several different operator space approximation properties transfer between the predual and the domain.</description>

      <title>On the Moment Functionals with Signed Representing Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $\sA$ is a finitely generated commutative unital real algebra and $K$ is a closed subset of the set $\hat{A}$ of characters of $\sA$. We study the following problem: When is {\it each} linear functional $L:{\sA} \to \dR$ an integral with respect to some signed Radon measure on $\hat{\sA}$ supported by the set $K$? A complete characterization of the sets $K$ and algebras $\sA$ by necessary and sufficient conditions is given. The result is applied to the polynomial algebra $\dR[x_1,\dots,x_d]$ and subsets $K$ of $\dR^d$.</description>

      <title>Minimal compact operators, subdifferential of the maximum eigenvalue and semi-definite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the issue of minimality of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space as a semi-definite problem, linking the work by Overton in [1] to the characterization of minimal hermitian matrices. This motivates us to investigate the relationship between minimal self-adjoint operators and the subdifferential of the maximum eigenvalue, initially for matrices and subsequently for compact operators. In order to do it we obtain new formulas of subdifferentials of maximum eigenvalues of compact operators that become useful in these optimization problems. Additionally, we provide formulas for the minimizing diagonals of rank one self-adjoint operators, a result that might be applied for numerical large-scale eigenvalue optimization.

      <title>On some properties of modulation spaces as Banach algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give some properties of the modulation spaces $M_s^{p,1}({\mathbf R}^n)$ as commutative Banach algebras. In particular, we show the Wiener-L\'evy theorem for $M^{p,1}_s({\mathbf R}^n)$, and clarify the sets of spectral synthesis for $M^{p,1}_s ({\mathbf R}^n)$ by using the ``ideal theory for Segal algebras'' developed in Reiter [30].The inclusion relationship between the modulation space $M^{p,1}_0 ({\mathbf R})$ and the Fourier Segal algebra ${\mathcal F}\hspace{-0.08cm}A_p({\mathbf R})$ is also determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses spectral synthesis for those modulation spaces $M^{p,q}_s({\mathbf R}^n)$ which form Banach algebras under pointwise multiplication. An important argument will be the ``ideal theory for Segal algebras'' by H. Reiter [15]. This paper is a continuation of our paper [5] where the case $q=1$ is treated. As a by-product we obtain a variant of Wiener-L\'evy theorem for $M^{p,q}_s({\mathbf R}^n)$ and Fourier-Wermer algebras ${\mathcal F}L^q_s({\mathbf R}^n)$.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of metaplectic operators within $L^p$ spaces, applications to pseudodifferential calculus, and time-frequency representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Housdorff-Young's inequality establishes the boundedness of the Fourier transform from $L^p$ to $L^q$ spaces for $1\leq p\leq2$ and $q=p'$, where $p'$ denotes the Lebesgue-conjugate exponent of $p$. This paper extends this classical result by characterizing the $L^p-L^q$ boundedness of all metaplectic operators, which play a significant role in harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that metaplectic operators are bounded on Lebesgue spaces if and only if their symplectic projection is either free or lower block triangular. As a byproduct, we identify metaplectic operators that serve as homeomorphisms of $L^p$ spaces. To achieve this, we leverage a parametrization of the symplectic group by F. M. Dopico and C. R. Johnson involving products of complex exponentials with quadratic phase, Fourier multipliers, linear changes of variables, and partial Fourier transforms. Then, we use our findings to provide boundedness results within $L^p$ spaces for pseudodifferential operators with symbols in Lebesgue spaces, and quantized by means of metaplectic operators. These quantizations consists of shift-invertible metaplectic Wigner distributions, which play a fundamental role in measuring local phase-space concentration of signals. Using the Dopico-Johnson factorization, we infer a decomposition law for metaplectic operators on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$ in terms of shift-invertible metaplectic operators, establish the density of shift-invertible symplectic matrices in $Sp(2d,\mathbb{R})$, and prove that the lack of shift-invertibility prevents metaplectic Wigner distributions to define the so-called modulation spaces $M^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the radial transfer matrix formalism for unitary one-channel operators. This generalizes previous formalisms for CMV matrices and scattering zippers. We establish an analog of Carmona's formula and deduce criteria for absolutely continuous spectrum which we apply to random Hilbert Schmidt perturbations of periodic scattering zippers.</description>

      <title>All convex bodies are in the subdifferential of some everywhere differentiable locally Lipschitz function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a differentiable locally Lipschitz function $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with the property that for every convex body $K\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ there exists $\bar x \in \mathbb{R}^N$  such that $K$ coincides with the set $\partial_L f(\bar x)$ of limits of derivatives $\{Df(x_n)\}_{n\geq 1}$ of sequences $\{x_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ converging to~$\bar x$. The technique can be further refined to recover all compact connected subsets with nonempty interior, disclosing an important difference between differentiable and continuously differentiable functions. It stems out from our approach that the class of these pathological functions contains an infinite dimensional vector space and is dense in the space of all locally Lipschitz functions for the uniform convergence.</description>

Abstract: We prove new factorization and dilation results for general positive operator-valued kernels, and we present their implications for associated Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, and their covariance structure. Further applications are to non-commutative probability theory, including a non-commutative Radon--Nikodym theorem for systems of completely positive maps.</description>

      <title>Infinitary primitive positive definability over the real numbers with convex relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a finite structure, the polymorphism invariant relations are exactly the primitively positively definable relations. On infinite structures, these two sets of relations are different in general. Infinitary primitively positively definable relations are a natural intermediate concept which extends primitive positive definability by infinite conjunctions.
  We consider for every convex set $S\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ the structure of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ with addition, scalar multiplication, constants, and additionally the relation $S$. We prove that depending on $S$, the set of all relations with an infinitary primitive positive definition in this structure equals one out of six possible sets. This dependency gives a natural partition of the convex sets into six nonempty classes. We also give an elementary geometric description of the classes and a description in terms of linear maps.
  The classification also implies that there is no locally closed clone between the clone of affine combinations and the clone of convex combinations.</description>

      <title>$M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article intends to initiate an investigation into the structure of $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$, where $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ denotes the Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ in $\mathbb{C}$. We introduce the notion of analytic primes and prove that $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are analytic primes. From Hilbert function space perspective, we additionally prove that $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are dense in the Hardy space. We show that outer functions play a key role in representing singly generated closed ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are $M$-ideals. This is also relevant to $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are finitely generated closed ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. We analyze $p$-sets of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ and their connection to the \v{S}ilov boundary of the maximal ideal space of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. Some of our results apply to the polydisc. In addition to addressing questions regarding $M$-ideals, the results presented in this paper offer some new perspectives on bounded analytic functions.</description>

      <title>The Boussinesq systems on non-compact Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of mild solutions to the Boussinesq systems on the framework of non-compact Riemannian manifolds. We work on some manifolds satisfying some bounded and negative conditions on curvature tensors. We consider a couple of Stokes and heat semigroups associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. By using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup we establish the existence and uniqueness of the bounded-in-time mild solution for linear system. Next, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to obtain the well-posedness by utilizing fixed point arguments. Moreover, we will prove the exponential stability of such solutions by using Gronwall's inequality. Finally, we give an application of stability to study periodic mild solutions. Our results extend the ones in \cite{Pi,HuyHa2022} in the aspect of global-in-time well-posedness and the existence of periodic mild solutions.</description>

      <title>On stability problem for the stationary Boussinesq system in Morrey-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces. Our results are generalized the previous ones of the steady Boussinesq systems in weak-$L^p$ spaces obtained by Hishida [T. Hishida, {\it On a class of Stable Steady flow to the Exterior Convection Problem}, Journal of Differential Equations, Vol. 141, Iss. 1 (1997), pages 54-85] and Ferreira et al. [L.C.F. Ferreira and E.J. Villamizar-Roa, {\it On the stability problem for the Boussinesq equations in weak-$L^p$ spaces}, Commun. Pure Appl. Anal.

Yamazaki, {\it The stability of small stationary solutions in Morrey Spaces of the Navier-Stokes equation}, Indiana University Mathematics Journal, Vol. 44, No. 4 (1995), pages 1307-1336].</description>
