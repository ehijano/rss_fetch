      <title>Dipole-Obstructed Cooper Pairing: Theory and Application to $j=3/2$ Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like electrons, Cooper pairs can carry a monopole charge if the pairing electrons come from two or more Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers. In such an instance, a superconductor is necessarily nodal due to an inherent topological pairing obstruction. In this work, we show that a similar obstruction is also possible when there is only one Fermi surface involved in the pairing process. By developing a Chern-vorticity theorem, we have identified a class of Fermi surfaces with a quantized dipolar Berry flux pattern, where all intra-Fermi-surface Cooper pairings are ``dipole-obstructed" and nodal. As a real-world application, we find that the dipole obstruction plays a crucial role in stabilizing the superconducting nodal structure for $j=3/2$ half-Heusler compounds.</description>

      <title>Unconventional pairing in Ising superconductors: Application to monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and in-plane mirror symmetry allows an Ising spin-orbit coupling to form in some two-dimensional materials. Examples include transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors like monolayer NbSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, TaS$_2$, and PbTe$_2$, where a nontrivial nature of the superconducting state is currently being explored. In this study, we develop a microscopic formalism for Ising superconductors that captures the superconducting instability arising from a momentum-dependent spin- and charge-fluctuation-mediated pairing interaction. We apply our pairing model to the electronic structure of monolayer NbSe$_2$, where first-principles calculations reveal the presence of strong paramagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations provide a quantitative measure of the mixing between the even- and odd-parity superconducting states and its variation with Coulomb interaction. Further, numerical analysis in the presence of an external Zeeman field reveals the role of Ising spin-orbit coupling and mixing of odd-parity superconducting state in influencing the low-temperature enhancement of the critical magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Type II t-J model in charge transfer regime in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of an 80 K superconductor in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure have attracted significant attention. Recent experiments indicate that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may be in the charge transfer regime, challenging the previous models based purely on the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. In this study, we propose a low energy model that incorporates doped holes in the oxygen $p$ orbitals. Given that the parent nickel state is in the $3d^{8}$ configuration with a spin-one moment, doped hole only screens it down to spin-half, in contrast to the Zhang-Rice singlet in cuprate. We dub the single hole state as Zhang-Rice spin-half and build an effective model which includes three spin-one states ($d^8$) and two Zhang-Rice spin-half states ($d^8 L$). At moderate pressure around $20$ GPa, the dominated oxygen orbital is an in-plane Wannier orbital with the same lattice symmetry as the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The resulting model reduces to the bilayer type II t-J model previously proposed in the Mott-Hubbard regime. Notably, the hopping between the in-plane $p$ orbitals of the two layers is still suppressed. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation reveals a pairing dome with the optimal hole doping level at $x=0.4\sim0.5$, distinct from the hole doped cuprate where optimal doping occurs around $x=0.19$. Further increasing pressure initially raises the critical temperature ($T_c$) until reaching an optimal pressure beyond which the $p_z$ orbital of oxygen becomes favorable and superconductivity is diminished. This shift from in-plane $p$ orbital to $p_z$ orbital may elucidate the experimentally observed superconducting dome with varying pressure. As an extension, we also suggest a trilayer version of the type II t-J model as the minimal model for pressured La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, which is distinct from the models in the Mott-Hubbard regime.</description>

      <title>Vortex formation and exotic superconducting states in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formation of vortices is a typical phenomenon of type-II superconductors under magnetic fields (H). In contrast, type-I superconductors do not host vortices because of their Meissner state. As rare cases, vortices have been observed in intermediate states of type-I superconductors; in addition, the recent observation of type-II superconductivity with vortices in a (originally type-I) Pb crystal film at extremely low temperature (T) under H has opened new pathway to study vortex physics. However, thermodynamic characteristics of such type-II-like superconducting states with vortices in originally type-I element superconductors have not been detected because of the lack of bulk example. In this study, we investigated superconducting states of phase-separated Sn-Pb solders using specific heat and magnetization to reveal magnetic-flux-trapping mechanisms. Here, we show that Sn islands in the Sn-Pb solders exhibit type-II-like superconducting states with vortices when the solders host extremely high magnetic fluxes after field cooling. Furthermore, with increasing T, the amount of trapped flux decreases, and the driving force of the magnetic flux changes from type-II superconducting states of Sn to supercurrent of Pb regions surrounding the Sn islands. The field-cooled Sn-Pb solders are rich in physics of bulk vortex formation and anomalously enhanced supercurrent in element (originally type-I) superconductors.</description>

      <title>Percolative supercurrent in superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find $\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative supercurrent flow.</description>

      <title>Free energy and metastable states in the square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free energy as a function of polarization is calculated for the square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model for $J_2 &lt; |J_1|/2$ using the random local field approximation (RLFA) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Within RLFA, it reveals a metastable state with zero polarization in the ordered phase. In addition, the Landau free energy calculated within RLFA indicates a geometric slab-droplet phase transition at low temperature, which cannot be predicted by the mean field approximation. In turn, restricted free energy calculations for finite-size samples, exact and using MC simulations, reveal metastable states with a wide range of polarization values, but with only two domains. Taking into account the dependence of the restricted free energy on the nearest-neighbor correlations allows us to identify several more metastable states. The calculations also reveal additional slab-droplet transitions at $J_2 &gt; |J_1|/4$. These findings enrich our knowledge of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model and the RLFA as a useful theoretical tool to study phase transitions in spin systems.</description>
