      <title>P-adic numbers and kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the relation between p-adic numbers and kernels in view of a recent large deviation theory for mean-field spin glasses. As an application we show several fundamental properties of numerical bases in kernel language. In particular, we show that the Derrida's Generalized Random Energy Model is a perfectly legitimate (random) numerical base.</description>

      <title>Lattice $\phi^{4}$ field theory as a multi-agent system of financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a $\phi^{4}$ lattice field theory with frustrated dynamics as a multi-agent system to reproduce stylized facts of financial markets such as fat-tailed distributions of returns and clustered volatility. Each lattice site, represented by a continuous degree of freedom, corresponds to an agent experiencing a set of competing interactions which influence its decision to buy or sell a given stock. These interactions comprise a cooperative term, which signifies that the agent should imitate the behavior of its neighbors, and a fictitious field, which compels the agent instead to conform with the opinion of the majority or the minority. To introduce the competing dynamics we exploit the Markov field structure to pursue a constructive decomposition of the $\phi^{4}$ probability distribution which we recompose with a Ferrenberg-Swendsen acceptance or rejection sampling step. We then verify numerically that the multi-agent $\phi^{4}$ field theory produces behavior observed on empirical data from the FTSE 100 London Stock Exchange index. We conclude by discussing how the presence of continuous degrees of freedom within the $\phi^{4}$ lattice field theory enables a representational capacity beyond that possible with multi-agent systems derived from Ising models.</description>

      <title>Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison against quantum and classical Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor-network-based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via tensor-network contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the tensor network representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm, with the latter representing an emerging class of classical Ising solvers. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art tensor network approaches lead to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the 3D diluted Ising model universality class in a mixture of two magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.</description>

      <title>Continuous Design and Reprogramming of Totimorphic Structures for Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a class of mechanical lattices with reconfigurable, zero-stiffness structures has been proposed, called Totimorphic structures. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that allows continuous reprogramming of a Totimorphic lattice's effective properties, such as mechanical and optical properties, via continuous geometric changes alone. Our approach is differentiable and guarantees valid Totimorphic lattice configurations throughout the optimisation process, thus providing not only specific configurations with desired properties but also trajectories through configuration space connecting them. It enables re-programmable structures where actuators are controlled via automatic differentiation on an objective-dependent cost function, altering the lattice structure at all times to achieve a given objective - which is interchangeable to achieve different functionalities. Our main interest lies in deep space applications where harsh, extreme, and resource-constrained environments demand solutions that offer flexibility, resource efficiency, and autonomy. We illustrate our framework through two proofs of concept: a re-programmable metamaterial as well as a space telescope mirror with adjustable focal length, both made from Totimorphic structures. The introduced framework is easily adjustable to a variety of Totimorphic designs and objectives, providing a light-weight model for endowing physical prototypes of Totimorphic structures with autonomous self-configuration and self-repair capabilities.</description>

      <title>Proportional infinite-width infinite-depth limit for deep linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distributional properties of linear neural networks with random parameters in the context of large networks, where the number of layers diverges in proportion to the number of neurons per layer. Prior works have shown that in the infinite-width regime, where the number of neurons per layer grows to infinity while the depth remains fixed, neural networks converge to a Gaussian process, known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process. However, this Gaussian limit sacrifices descriptive power, as it lacks the ability to learn dependent features and produce output correlations that reflect observed labels. Motivated by these limitations, we explore the joint proportional limit in which both depth and width diverge but maintain a constant ratio, yielding a non-Gaussian distribution that retains correlations between outputs. Our contribution extends previous works by rigorously characterizing, for linear activation functions, the limiting distribution as a nontrivial mixture of Gaussians.</description>

      <title>Cooperative motion in equilibrium phases across two-dimension melting in pure and disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover the dynamics of particles with Gaussian core interactions across melting in pure and disordered two-dimensional (2D) systems. Intriguing signatures of cooperative motion of particles in string-like paths are found at low temperatures. Such a motion, while common to glasses and supercooled liquids, are realized here in traditional equilibrium phases, including in pure systems. We explore the interplay of such motion and impurities and report their repercussions on spatiotemporal correlations. In particular, cooperative motion seems to cause a departure from the diffusive dynamics, causing slow relaxation.</description>

      <title>Global and local synchrony of coupled neurons in small-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronous firing of neurons is thought to play important functional roles such as feature binding and switching of cognitive states. Although synchronization has mainly been investigated using model neurons with simple connection topology so far, real neural networks have more complex structures. Here we examine behavior of pulse-coupled leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with various network structures. We first show that the dispersion of the number of connections for neurons influences dynamical behavior even if other major topological statistics are kept fixed. The rewiring probability parameter representing the randomness of networks bridges two spatially opposite frameworks: precise local synchrony and rough global synchrony. Finally, cooperation of the global connections and the local clustering property, which is prominent in small-world networks, reinforces synchrony of distant neuronal groups receiving coherent inputs.</description>

      <title>Unusual Coulomb phase physics in the arctic square ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The square ice is a two-dimensional spin liquid hosting a Coulomb phase physics. When constrained under specific boundary conditions, the so-called domain-wall boundary conditions, a phase separation occurs that leads to the formation of a spin liquid confined within a disk surrounded by magnetically ordered regions. Here, we numerically characterize the ground-state properties of this spin liquid, coined the arctic square ice in reference to a phenomenon known in statistical mechanics. Our results reveal that both the vertex distributions and the magnetic correlations are inhomogeneous within the liquid region, and they exhibit a radial dependence. If these properties resemble those of the conventional square ice close to the center of the disk, they evolve continuously as the disk perimeter is approached. There, the spin liquid orders. As a result, pinch points, signaling the presence of algebraic spin correlations, coexist with magnetic Bragg peaks in the magnetic structure factor computed within the disk. The arctic square ice thus appears as an unconventional Coulomb phase sharing common features with a fragmented spin liquid, albeit on a charge-neutral vacuum.</description>

      <title>Square ice Coulomb phase as a percolated vertex lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The square ice is a canonical example of a Coulomb phase in two dimensions: Its ground state is extensively degenerate and satisfies a local constraint on the spin arrangement (the so-called ice rule). In this paper, we use a loop flip algorithm to explore the properties of this ground state that we analyze not in terms of a spin texture, but rather in terms of a spatial distribution of ice-rule satisfying vertices. More specifically, we determine for various lattice sizes the average vertex populations characterizing the ice manifold, the pairwise vertex correlations, and the size distribution of vertex clusters. Comparing these results to those obtained from random, constraint-free vertex tilings, the square ice manifold is found to resemble an almost ideal vertex gas, and the cluster size distribution of ice-rule satisfying vertices is well approximated by percolation theory. Remarkably, this description remains reasonably accurate when monopoles are present in a dilute amount, allowing a direct comparison with experiments. Revising former experimental results on two artificial square ice systems, we illustrate the interest of our approach to spot the presence of a Coulomb phase from a vertex analysis.</description>

      <title>Large time effective kinetics $\beta$-functions for quantum (2+p)-spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the lens of renormalization group (RG) theory. The RG is based on a coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic whose eigenvalue distribution undergoes a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. We focus our investigation on perturbation theory and vertex expansion for effective average action, which proves more amenable than standard nonperturbative approaches due to the distinct non-local temporal and replicative structures that emerge in the effective interactions following disorder integration. Our work entails the formulation of rules to address these non-localities within the framework of perturbation theory, culminating in the derivation of one-loop $\beta$-functions. Our explicit calculations focus on the cases $p=3$, $p=\infty$, and additional analytic material is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of localization phase transition in the non-Hermitian Disorder-Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The driven dynamics of localization transitions in a non-Hermitian Disorder-Aubry-Andr\'{e} (DAA) model are thoroughly examined under both open boundary conditions (OBC) and periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Through an analysis of the static properties of observables, including the localization length ($\xi$), inverse participation ratio ($\rm IPR$), and energy gap ($\Delta E$), we found that the critical exponents examined under PBC are also applicable under OBC. The Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) for the driven dynamics in the non-Hermitian DAA systems is formulated and numerically verified for different quench directions. Notably, for the dynamical paths considered, boundary conditions had minimal impact on the evolution process. This study generalizes the application of the KZS to the dynamical localization transitions within systems featuring dual localization mechanisms.</description>
