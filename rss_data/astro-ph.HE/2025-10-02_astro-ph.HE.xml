      <title>Accelerating SED Modeling of Astrophysical Objects Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of astrophysical objects with physically motivated models is computationally expensive. These models require solving coupled differential equations in high-dimensional parameter spaces, making traditional fitting techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling prohibitive. A key example is modeling non-thermal emission from blazar jets - relativistic outflows from supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei that are among the most powerful emitters in the Universe. To address this challenge, we employ machine learning to accelerate SED evaluations, enabling efficient Bayesian inference. We generate a large sample of lepto-hadronic blazar emission models and train a neural network (NN) to predict the photon spectrum with strongly reduced run time while preserving accuracy. As a proof of concept, we present an NN-based tool for blazar SED modeling, laying the groundwork for future extensions and for providing an open-access resource for the astrophysics community.</description>

      <title>SN 2025coe: A Triple-Peaked Calcium-Strong Transient from A White-Dwarf Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2025coe is a calcium-strong transient located at an extremely large projected offset $\sim$39.3 kpc from the center of its host, the nearby early-type galaxy NGC 3277 at a distance of $\sim$25.5 Mpc. In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display three distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \, peak} \approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a late-time bump at $t \approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-3} \, M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \, R_{\odot}$. The tidal disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni, and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.</description>

      <title>Late-afterglow Emission from a Quasi-spherical Outflow in a stratified environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmic events occurring at large distances beyond our galaxy. They provide a unique opportunity to study electromagnetic patterns not seen elsewhere. When the collimated GRB outflow interacts with the outer layers of a star or the wind generated by a binary neutron star merger, it releases energy, forming a quasi-spherical outflow around it. This broad outflow begins to radiate once it has transferred enough energy to the surrounding medium. We have developed a new analytical model that describes the synchrotron afterglow scenario of the quasi-spherical outflow, including factors such as stratified density, self-absorption regime, and the fraction of electrons accelerated by the shock front. We also successfully describe the multiwavelength observations of a sample of llGRB afterglows (GRB 980425, 031203, 060218, 100316D, 130603B, 150101B and 171205A) that exhibited a late component, analyzed in both stellar wind and constant-density environments. Our analysis shows that a constant-density environment is favored. Additionally, we consider the multiwavelength upper limits of the short bursts reported in the Swift-BAT database.</description>

      <title>Exotic PeVatrons as sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include: ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation (CTA) gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Simulations of Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Perpendicular Electron-positron Shocks with Proton Admixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle acceleration in relativistic shocks of electron-positron plasmas with proton admixture is investigated through two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The upstream plasma, with a bulk Lorentz factor of $10$ and a magnetization parameter of 0.02, includes a small fraction of protons ($\sim 5\%$ by number). A relativistic perpendicular shock is formed by reflecting the flow off a conducting wall. The shock structure, electromagnetic fields, and particle energy spectra are analyzed. The particle density and the magnetic field have fluctuations. In the far-downstream region of the shock, positrons are accelerated to energies comparable to protons and develop a hard nonthermal component with a spectral index of $\sim 2$ in their energy spectrum, while electrons remain confined to lower energies. This asymmetry is attributed to the polarization properties of proton-driven electromagnetic waves, which favor positron acceleration. The results highlight the importance of plasma composition in shaping particle acceleration and nonthermal emission in relativistic shocks. These findings provide new insights into the microphysics of particle acceleration in astrophysical sources containing relativistic shocks.</description>

      <title>Multiband Optical Photometric and Spectroscopic Monitoring of the 2024 Flare Event in Transition Blazar OP313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are active galactic nuclei known for their extreme variability, offering unique opportunities to study jet physics and high-energy emission mechanisms. In 2024, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) OP313 underwent a remarkable flare event, during which the gamma-ray flux observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT) increased by a factor of 60 over its average value. The flare peak lasted less than two days. Using optical telescopes, we conducted 100-day time-scale observations. Multi-wavelength data revealed that OP313 entered an active state 50 days prior to the flare and remained active for at least 50 days afterward. We propose that this prolonged activity results from variations in electron density within the shock front due to changes in the accretion rate. Concurrently, OP313's spectrum transitioned from an FSRQ-like state to a BL Lac-like state, characterized by a significant increase in the synchrotron peak frequency and the disappearance of broad-line region emission lines. In the post-flare phase, we observed a decoupling between synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, along with a possible decrease in the magnetic field strength within the shock front.</description>

      <title>Diffuse neutrino flux from coronal magnetospheric current sheets of accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-jetted AGN exhibit hard X-ray emission with a power law spectrum above $\sim$2 keV, which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons (pairs) in the vicinity of the black hole. The origin and composition of this plasma source, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. Our study focuses on the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets in the neutrino production of AGN coronae. We present a model that has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. Furthermore, we combine our coronal model with an AGN population in order to provide a prediction for the diffuse neutrino flux measured on Earth. We compare our results with the observational data by IceCube and we find a satisfactory agreement on both the flux value and the slope of the neutrino distribution when we assume a $\sigma_{\rm p}$ value of $10^5$ for all the sources in our sample.</description>

      <title>Addressing Selected Gamma-Ray Burst Science Topics with Future Space Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, offering insights into stellar collapse, extreme matter behavior, and cosmic evolution. The advent of multi-messenger astronomy, combining electromagnetic, gravitational wave, and neutrino observations, alongside advances in high-energy polarimetry, is revolutionizing GRB research, enabling deeper exploration of their physical mechanisms.
  This manuscript summarizes how upcoming and proposed space-based missions will tackle key challenges in GRB science, focusing on four areas: (i) identifying high-redshift GRBs to probe the early universe, (ii) enhancing multi-messenger detection and localization, (iii) improving multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB afterglows, and (iv) studying prompt emission polarization to understand jet dynamics and magnetic fields. Highlighting planned missions and their advancements, this work provides a snapshot of current GRB research frontiers, with updates on the evolving status of these missions.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the radiation mechanism of short GRB~160821B through multi-wavelength modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB~160821B is the only short GRB detected to date at very high energy (VHE, $\gtrsim 100$ GeV). At a redshift $z=0.161$, it was detected by MAGIC telescopes approximately four hours since the trigger. VHE dataset was complied with the datasets of other wavelengths in between the timescale of 1.7 to 4 hours to construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). In previous studies of GRB~160821B, synchrotron and external Compton (EC) model could explain the VHE emission better than the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Although, these fits were mostly eyeballing data without any optimisation. Our model includes the combination of synchrotron, SSC, and EC models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Our analysis reveals that the EC contribution is negligible in comparison with the SSC and our model explains the VHE data well for the wind medium. We found that GRB~160821B is the least energetic VHE GRB and it occurred in high density wind medium which is quiet unusual for a short GRB. But like other long-duration VHE GRBs, GRB~160821B occurred in a poorly magnetised medium. As there is no statistical study on afterglow modelling of short GRB sample, we compare the inferred properties of GRB~160821B with other VHE GRBs. It stands out distinctively in the $E_{k, \rm iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ parameter space and lies outside the 3-$\sigma$ region of the correlation. In future, more VHE detections of short GRBs, in the CTA era, will provide crucial insights into the emission sites, radiation mechanisms, and particle acceleration, as well as their connection to long GRBs.</description>

      <title>Understanding the evolution of black hole spin in X-ray binary systems: Case study of XTE~J1550-564</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray binary system XTE~J1550-564, with the primary objective of analyzing the evolution of the black hole's spin parameter. To achieve this objective, we embarked on the necessary step of identifying a plausible progenitor for the system. Using a set of models covering various parameter combinations, we were able to replicate the system's observed characteristics within acceptable error margins, including fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and effective temperature. The model results indicate the possibility of diverse evolutionary pathways for the system, highlighting the significant role played by the initial mass of the donor star and the efficiency of mass transfer episodes. While some models are well-aligned with estimates of the mass transfer rate, they all fall short of explaining the black hole's observed moderate spin ($a^* = 0.49$). We also explored alternative magnetic braking prescriptions, finding that only an extreme and fully conservative scenario, based on the convection and rotation boosted prescription, can reproduce the observed spin and only in a marginal way. Our study attempts to shed light on the complex dynamics of black hole X-ray binaries and the challenges of explaining their observed properties with theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are spinning neutron stars typically observed as pulses emitted at radio wavelengths. These pulsations exhibit a rotational stability that rival the best atomic clocks, making pulsars one of the most important tools for resolving gravitational phenomena in extreme environments. I will present an overview of the ways in which radio pulsars can be used to test strong-field gravity and observe gravitational radiation, both in the context of historical and ongoing experiments. I will also describe how these measurements can be translated to sought-after quantities like the masses and moments of inertia of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Pan-STARRS follow-up of the gravitational-wave event S250818k and the lightcurve of SN 2025ulz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilonovae are the scientifically rich, but observationally elusive, optical transient phenomena associated with compact binary mergers. Only a handful of events have been discovered to date, all through multi-wavelength (gamma ray) and multi-messenger (gravitational wave) signals. Given their scarcity, it is important to maximise the discovery possibility of new kilonova events. To this end, we present our follow-up observations of the gravitational-wave signal, S250818k, a plausible binary neutron star merger at a distance of $237 \pm 62$ Mpc. Pan-STARRS tiled 286 and 318 square degrees (32% and 34% of the 90% sky localisation region) within 3 and 7 days of the GW signal, respectively. ATLAS covered 70% of the skymap within 3 days, but with lower sensitivity. These observations uncovered 47 new transients; however, none were deemed to be linked to S250818k. We undertook an expansive follow-up campaign of AT 2025ulz, the purported counterpart to S250818k. The griz-band lightcurve, combined with our redshift measurement ($z = 0.0849 \pm 0.0003$) all indicate that SN 2025ulz is a SN IIb, and thus not the counterpart to S250818k. We rule out the presence of a AT 2017gfo-like kilonova within $\approx 27$% of the distance posterior sampled by our Pan-STARRS pointings ($\approx 9.1$% across the total 90% three-dimensional sky localisation). We demonstrate that early observations are optimal for probing the distance posterior of the three-dimensional gravitational-wave skymap, and that SN 2025ulz was a plausible kilonova candidate for $\lesssim 5$ days, before ultimately being ruled out.</description>

      <title>iPTF16geu through the lens of thermonuclear explosion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnification resulting from strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to add new constraints to the cosmic evolution of supernova progenitors by enabling the study of distant supernovae that would otherwise not be observable. iPTF16geu is the most well-observed gravitationally lensed supernova (glSN) to date. At a redshift of $z = 0.409$ and magnified by a factor of $\sim$68, extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations have been obtained. The explosion mechanism producing this rare event and differences compared to lower redshift supernovae however have not been explored in detail. Here we compare observations of iPTF16geu to existing radiative transfer simulations of type Ia supernova explosion models selected from the literature. We find that overall the DDC6 and PDDEL1 models, specific variations of the delayed detonation explosion scenario, produce the closest match to the light curves and many absorption features, but struggle to replicate the observed colours and in particular the rest-frame UV. We also investigate the magnification and reddening values required to improve agreement with the selected models. We find some evidence in favour of a UV flux excess that may be intrinsic to iPTF16geu or due to external factors such as host galaxy subtraction and uncertainties in the reddening law. Upcoming surveys will significantly increase the samples of SNe discovered at high redshifts due to strong gravitational lensing. These glSNe will enable tighter constraints on the explosion physics of type Ia supernovae and how this has evolved throughout the Universe.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Acts: Quantifying Black Hole Formation with the DSNB Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.</description>

      <title>JWST-discovered AGN: evidence for heavy obscuration in the type-2 sample from the first stacked X-ray detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling properties of the high-redshift AGN population recently discovered by JWST, including both broad-line and narrow-line sources, is their X-ray weakness. With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant ($\sim 3\sigma$) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime ($&gt; 2 \times 10^{24} $cm$^{-2}$) with a large covering factor, approaching 4$\pi$. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments. A brief comparison with the current observations and the implications for the evolution of AGN are discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral effects and Joule heating in hot and dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial states of dense matter with nonzero electron chiral imbalance could potentially give rise to strong magnetic fields through chiral plasma instability. Previous work indicated that unless chiral chemical potential is as large as the electron vector chemical potential, the growth of magnetic fields due to the instability is washed out by chirality flipping rate enabled by electron mass. We re-examine this claim in a broader range of parameters and find that at higher temperatures the hierarchy is reversed supporting a growing magnetic field for an initial electron chiral chemical potential much smaller than the electron vector chemical potential. Further, we identify a qualitatively new effect relevant for magnetized hot and dense medium where chiral magnetic effect (CME) sourced by density fluctuation acts as a powerful source of Joule heating. Remarkably, even modest chiral chemical potentials (keV) in such environment can deposit energy densities set by the QCD scale in a relatively short time of the order of a few milliseconds or seconds. We speculate how this mechanism makes CME-driven Joule heating a potentially critical ingredient in the dynamics of turbulent density fluctuation of supernovae and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Chase Orbits, not Time: A Scalable Paradigm for Long-Duration Eccentric Gravitational-Wave Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00116v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Automated Modeling with AAP-Imfit: Astrometry and Photometry via CASA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution radio intensity maps, crucial for detailed studies of compact sources like active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their relativistic jets. Analyzing jet components in these maps traditionally involves manual Gaussian fitting, a time-consuming bottleneck for large datasets. To address this, we present an automated batch-processing tool, based on the Gaussian fitting capabilities of CASA, designed to streamline VLBI jet component characterization (AAP-Imfit). Our algorithm sets a detection limit, performs automatic 2D Gaussian fitting, and removes model artifacts, efficiently extracting component flux densities and positions. This method enables systematic and reproducible analysis, significantly reducing the time required for fitting extensive VLBI datasets. We validated AAP-Imfit by using VLBI observations of the blazars 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, comparing our results with published fits. The close agreement in residual root mean square (RMS) values and model/residual-to-map RMS ratios confirms the accuracy of our automated approach in reproducing original flux distributions. While visual inspection remains important for complex or faint features, this routine significantly accelerates VLBI component fitting, paving the way for large-scale statistical studies of jet dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. II. Dependence on WIMP Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $&lt;$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.</description>

      <title>Searching for Ultra-light Dark Matter in Spatial Correlations of White Dwarf Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If dark matter is ultra-light and has certain Standard Model interactions, it can change the mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars. The coherence length of ultra-light dark matter imparts spatial correlations in deviations from the canonical mass-radius relation, and thus white dwarfs can be used to reconstruct the coherence length, or equivalently the particle mass, of the dark matter field. We simulate the observability of such spatial correlations accounting for realistic complications like variable hydrogen envelope thickness, dust, binaries, measurement noise, and distance uncertainties in DA white dwarfs. Using a machine learning approach on simulated data, we measure the dark matter field coherence length and find that large deviations from the mass-radius relation ($\sim10\%$ change in radius) are needed to produce an observable signal given realistic noise sources. We apply our spatial correlation measurement routine to the SDSS catalog of 10,207 DA white dwarfs. We detect a positive spatial correlation among white dwarfs at separations corresponding to a coherence length of $300\pm50$ pc, with an average Z-score of 85 for white dwarfs separated by less than this coherence length. We conclude that this signal is due to observational bias. The signal can be explained by an offset between measurements and theory for nearby cool white dwarfs, and the presence of few, low-temperature white dwarfs with noisy measurements at further distances. With future improvements in white dwarf models and measurement techniques, particularly for cool white dwarfs, this method can provide interesting constraints on ultra-light dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Shadow of black holes with consistent thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>Novel very-high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations of compact, non-singular objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel set of very-high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (VHFQPO's) in the context of compact, non-singular horizonless objects. Focussing on the static, spherically symmetric case we utilize metrics of non-singular black holes that are accompanied by a regulator length scale $L &gt; 0$. The choice $L \gtrsim GM$ generically removes the horizon from these metrics leading to compact, horizonless but non-singular objects. This generically guarantees the existence of a stable orbit at small radii $r \ll r_\text{ISCO}$, independent of the angular momentum of the massive particle. Crucially, the absence of a horizon allows the resulting VHFQPO's to escape to infinity, spanning the range from 1kHz ($M = 10M_\odot$) to 25 kHz ($M = 2M_\odot$). Within the paradigm of non-singular spacetime geometries, the absence of such VHFQPO's from X-ray binary spectra implies the presence of a horizon around the central, compact object.</description>

      <title>Properties of Neutron Stars with Hyperons within a Relativistic Metamodel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effects of $\Lambda$-hyperons on neutron star properties employing a metamodel framework for the equation of state (EoS). Different choices for defining the hyperonic couplings with different levels of parametric freedom are discussed. In all models, the predicted NS maximum masses are reduced compared with the purely nucleonic composition as expected. In the case of relating hyperonic couplings via $SU(6)$-symmetry arguments to the nucleonic ones, we find that NS radii for intermediate mass stars are shifted to higher values compared with purely nucleonic stars, in agreement with the existing literature. However, allowing for more freedom for the hyperonic couplings, the effect is strongly reduced, and the distributions in the NS mass-radius plane of models with and without hyperons become very close. We have also investigated how different nucleonic density functionals influence the hyperon matter composition and neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>GW250114 reveals black hole horizon signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The horizon of a black hole, the "surface of no return," is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a "direct wave" component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.</description>

      <title>The trigger design for AdvCam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AdvCam is a next-generation camera for the Large-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, based on silicon photomultipliers. Its fully digital readout system enables the design of new, sophisticated trigger logic. The Large-Sized Telescopes aim to cover the low-energy range of the cosmic gamma-ray spectrum, with a threshold starting at about 20 GeV, using the existing photomultiplier tube camera. The AdvCam, along with the new trigger logic, as shown by simulations, lowers the detectable energy threshold to 13 GeV. The proposed trigger logic has a multilevel structure. The first level involves fast coincidences among small pixel regions at a rate of approximately 1 GHz, while the second level processes all camera pixels within an approximately 10-nanosecond time window. Different families of machine learning algorithms optimized for FPGAs form the second-level trigger. In this work, we consider two main approaches: Deep Neural Networks and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, both running with latencies below 1 microsecond at a 1 MHz rate. This work provides a detailed description of the trigger chain and its performance, as studied through simulation.</description>

      <title>Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \le S \le 2 \times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo \&amp; Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Quasar Main Sequence unfolded by 2.5D FRADO (Natural expression of Eddington ratio, black hole mass, and inclination)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasar main sequence (QMS), characterized by the Eigenvector 1 (EV1), serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\dot{m}$) is the primary physical driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$) acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a representative range of $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$ line under different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the role of $\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\rm Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\dot{m}$ can be regarded as the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale directly with it. The $M_{\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\rm Fe}$ and FWHM for a given $\dot{m}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental modes of rotating neutron stars with various degrees of differential rotation in dynamical spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violent astrophysical events, including core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers, can result in rotating neutron stars with diverse degrees of differential rotation. Oscillation modes of these neutron stars could be excited and emit strong gravitational waves. Detecting these modes may provide information about neutron stars, including their structures and dynamics. Hence, dynamical simulations were employed to construct relations for quantifying the oscillation mode frequency in previous studies. Specifically, linear relations for the frequencies of fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_{F}$ and fundamental $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$ were constructed by simulations with the Cowling approximation. Nevertheless, these relations can overestimate $f_{F}$ and underestimate $f_{^2f}$ up to $\sim 30\%$. Furthermore, it has yet to be fully studied how the degree of differential rotation affects $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Here, for the first time, we consider both various degrees of differential rotation $\Tilde{A}$ and dynamical spacetime to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$. Through 2D axisymmetric simulations, we first show that both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ scale almost linearly with the stellar compactness $M/R$ for different values of $\Tilde{A}$. We also observe the quasi-linear relations for both $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ with the kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ for different $\Tilde{A}$ values. Finally, we constructed linear fits that can quantify $f_{F}$ and $f_{^2f}$ by $T/|W|$. Consequently, this work updated the relations for the fundamental modes of rotating neutron stars with differential rotations in dynamical spacetime.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Observations of supermassive black hole binary candidates. Strong sinusoidal variations at 95, 147 and 225 GHz in PKS 2131$-$021 and PKS J0805$-$0111</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large sinusoidal variations in the radio light curves of the blazars PKS J0805$-$0111 and PKS 2131$-$021 have recently been discovered with an 18-year monitoring programme at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, making these systems strong supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates. The sinusoidal variations in PKS 2131$-$021 dominate its light curves from 2.7 GHz to optical frequencies. We report sinusoidal variations observed in both objects with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 95, 147 and 225 GHz consistent with the radio light curves. The ACT 95 GHz light curve of PKS 2131$-$021 agrees well with the contemporaneous 91.5 GHz ALMA light curve and is comparable in quality, while the ACT light curves of PKS J0805$-$0111, for which there are no ALMA or other millimetre light curves, show that PKS 2131$-$021 is not an isolated case, and that this class of AGN exhibits the following properties: (a) the sinusoidal pattern dominates over a broad range of frequencies; (b) the amplitude of the sine wave compared to its mean value is monochromatic (i.e., nearly constant across frequencies); (c) the phase of the sinusoid phase changes monotonically as a function of frequency; (d) the sinusoidal variations are intermittent. We describe a physical model for SMBHB systems, the modified Kinetic Orbital model, that explains all four of these phenomena. Monitoring of ${\sim}8000$ blazars by the Simons Observatory over the next decade should provide a large number of SMBHB candidates that will shed light on the nature of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects on primordial black hole capture in neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the capture of a primordial black hole (PBH) by a neutron star, accounting for the tidal perturbation from a nearby star or planet. For asteroid-mass PBHs, which could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe, a weakly bound post-capture orbit could be tidally disturbed to the point of preventing the PBH from settling in the neutron star and consuming it within a cosmologically short timescale. We show how this effect depends on environmental parameters and can weaken the proposed constraints based on observations of old neutron stars in high-density dark matter environments for PBH masses $\lesssim 10^{22}\,$g. We also provide approximate analytical formulae for the capture rates.</description>

      <title>Modelling multiwavelength afterglows of the VHE-GRB population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of very high energy (VHE, $\gtrsim$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has provided new insights into afterglow physics. Understanding the temporal and spectral evolution of VHE GRBs requires detailed modelling of multiwavelength observations spanning radio to VHE $\gamma$ rays. Previous studies interpreted afterglow of VHE GRBs using a range of frameworks, including single- and multi-zone jet configurations, synchrotron radiation from forward and reverse shocks, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes, as well as hadronic emission processes. We have modeled five long-duration VHE GRBs - GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C and GRB 221009A; using the NAIMA code and modifications to it. The results from our analysis indicate that SSC is the dominant VHE emission mechanism, with negligible contribution from external Compton. Most VHE GRBs are well described by the forward shock model in a spherical jet configuration, where constant density interstellar medium is preferred over wind medium. Additionally, we find that VHE GRBs tend to occur in environments with lower magnetic fields and higher ambient medium densities. Interestingly, VHE GRBs lie at the edge of the $3\sigma$ region of the $E_{\rm k,iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ correlation observed in other energetic GRBs. Our model slightly over predicts the radio fluxes, indicating that a more complicated modelling might be required in some cases. These findings provide crucial constraints on VHE GRB emission sites and mechanisms and serve as a benchmark for future observations and theoretical studies in the era of CTA and next-generation $\gamma$-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Updated predictions for gravitational wave emission from TDEs for next generation observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) emission from stars tidally disrupted by black holes (TDEs), using a semi-analytical approach. Contrary to previous works where this signal is modeled as a monochromatic burst, we here take into account all its harmonic components. On top of this, we also extend the analysis to a population of repeated-partial TDEs, where the star undergoes multiple passages around the black hole before complete disruption. For both populations, we estimate the rate of individual GW-detections considering future observatories like LISA and a potential deci-Hertz (dHz) mission, and derive the GW background from these sources. Our conclusions, even if more conservative, are consistent with previous results presented in literature. In fact, full disruptions of stars will not be seen by LISA but will be important targets for dHz observatories. In contrast, GWs from repeated disruptions will not be detectable in the near future.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT -- XVIII. Complex sub-pulse modulation patterns, bi-drifting and mode changing of nine radio pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of sub-pulse modulations in nine pulsars which show evidence of changes in sub-pulse drift direction as a function of pulse longitude in the Thousand Pulsar Array single pulse survey with MeerKAT. We confirm that all of these are consistent with persistent drift direction changes. These 'bi-drifting' pulsars present a challenge to the classical carousel model for sub-pulse drifting. In general, bi-drifting in this expanded sample is less clear than some of the previously published cases, which we attribute to narrower profile widths ($&lt;20$ degrees) or smaller $P_3$ values (close to 2$P$). However, given the broad variety of pulse shapes and drift behaviours across the pulsar population, it is unsurprising that the phenomenon is not limited to only those where it can most easily be detected. Four of our samples show at least two emission modes with different profile shapes and drift properties, which seems to be a relatively common feature of bi-drifting pulsars. We also find jumps in sub-pulse phase between adjacent components in two pulsars. In addition to our MeerKAT L-band data, we used GMRT observations for four, and MeerKAT UHF observations for two of these pulsars to investigate the frequency dependence of sub-pulse drift. We find subtle changes in the drift as a function of frequency, but no clear overall pattern. Looking at the distribution of bi-drifting pulsars over $P$, $\dot{P}$ and $P_3$ suggests they are consistent with the underlying population of all drifting pulsars.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long Gamma-ray Bursts from Micro-Tidal Disruption Events: The Case of GRB 250702B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs), a rare class of high-energy transients with durations $&gt;10^3$s, remain poorly understood. GRB 250702B is notable for its multi-hour prompt emission, an X-ray precursor $\sim$1 day earlier, off-nuclear host position, and hard, rapidly variable gamma-rays. This combination is difficult to explain with standard ULGRB progenitors such as blue-supergiant collapsars, magnetar engines, or white-dwarf tidal disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes. We interpret the event as a micro-tidal disruption event ($\mu$TDE), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star partially or fully disrupts a main-sequence star. Three $\mu$TDE pathways can reproduce the observed precursor-main flare delay: (i) a dynamical (partial/repeating) disruption, in which a grazing passage yields a faint precursor and the core returns after $\sim$day for a deeper encounter; (ii) a natal-kick disruption, where the delay reflects the ballistic motion of a newborn compact object relative to its companion, leading to full disruption; and (iii) a hybrid natal-kick + partial case, in which the kick seeds the close encounter but the first passage is only partial, with the core returning on the day-scale period. Cross-section scalings imply comparable rates for partial and full outcomes in both dynamical and natal-kick scenarios. The highly variable, hard $\gamma$-ray emission supports association with a stellar-mass compact object. Fallback and viscous accretion naturally explain the ultra-long duration, energetics, and ks-scale X-ray variability. We outline observational discriminants between the three channels and argue that $\mu$TDEs offer a compelling framework for ULGRBs such as GRB 250702B.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive X-ray Observations of the Exceptional Ultra-long X-ray and Gamma-ray Transient GRB 250702B with Swift, NuSTAR, and Chandra: Insights from the X-ray Afterglow Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 250702B is an exceptional transient that produced multiple episodes of luminous gamma-ray radiation lasting for $&gt;25$ ks, placing it among the class of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, unlike any known GRB, the \textit{Einstein Probe} detected soft X-ray emission up to 24 hours before the gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger. The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale X-ray variability ($\Delta T/T &lt; 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\sim$0.3 days and continued NuSTAR variability to $\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity; including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\gtrsim 3$ days. Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission in a wind-like ($k \approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the long-lived engine and early soft X-ray emission, are difficult to reconcile with a collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass black hole remains viable. Decisive discrimination between progenitors will require sensitive late-time X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Testing the nature of GW200105 by probing the frequency evolution of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency $\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General Relativity (GR). In this $\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.</description>

      <title>Neutron star evolution by combining discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume methods</title>

Abstract: We present here a new hybrid scheme that combines a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with compact finite volume (FV) and finite difference (FD) methods. The computational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not overlap. Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information exchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for ghost zones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations. Furthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that need information exchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on noncuboid meshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element and its six nearest neighbors. With this reduced communication, we aim to retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. In addition, the information exchange between adjacent elements is much simpler than in a traditional FV implementation, because we always have grid points at the interface, so that only surface interpolation is required. As a result it is much easier to implement adaptive mesh refinement. The goal is to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the more robust FV/FD method in elements that contain nonsmooth shocks or star surfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element should be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and test the new scheme. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases. These include the challenging cases of a neutron star initially in an unstable equilibrium migrating to a stable configuration and a boosted neutron star. These cases are simulated for the first time here in full 3D with general relativistic hydrodynamics using DG methods. We also describe additional numerical methods, such as the limiters and the atmosphere treatment we need for our simulations.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarimetry of Accreting White Dwarfs: A Case Study of EX Hydrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first first X-ray polarization measurements of a white dwarf, the intermediate polar EX Hya. We measured significant polarization only in the 2 -- 3 keV energy band with a polarization degree of 8 percent at a $3\sigma$ significance. No significant polarization was detected above 3 keV, which we attribute to the higher energy bands having lower signal-to-noise. We found that the scattering surface detected by the IXPE is nearly perpendicular to the optical scattering plane, showing that the X-ray scattering surface is the WD and close to the base of the accretion column. Finally, we show how the polarization can be used to estimate the height of the accretion shock above the white dwarf's surface.</description>
