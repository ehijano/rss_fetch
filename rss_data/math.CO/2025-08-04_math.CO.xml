      <title>On simultaneous $(s, s+t, s+2t, \dots)$-core partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider simultaneous $(s,s+t,s+2t,\dots,s+pt)$-core partitions in the large-$p$ limit, or (when $s&lt;t$), partitions in which no hook may be of length $s \pmod{t}$. We study generating functions, containment properties, and congruences when $s$ is not coprime to $t$. As a boundary case of the general study made by Cho, Huh and Sohn, we provide enumerations when $s$ is coprime to $t$, and answer positively a conjecture of Fayers on the polynomial behavior of the size of the set of simultaneous $(s,s+t,s+2t,\dots,s+pt)$-core partitions when $p$ grows arbitrarily large. Of particular interest throughout is the comparison to the behavior of simultaneous $(s,t)$-cores.</description>

      <title>The symmetric strong circuit elimination property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $C_1$ and $C_2$ are circuits in a matroid $M$ with $e_1$ in $C_1-C_2$ and $e$ in $C_1\cap C_2$, then $M$ has a circuit $C_3$ such that $e\in C_3\subseteq (C_1\cup C_2)-e$. This strong circuit elimination axiom is inherently asymmetric. A matroid $M$ has the symmetric strong circuit elimination property (SSCE) if, when the above conditions hold and $e_2\in C_2-C_1$, there is a circuit $C_3'$ with $\{e_1,e_2\}\subseteq C_3'\subseteq (C_1\cup C_2)-e$. We prove that a connected matroid has this property if and only if it has no two skew circuits. We also characterize such matroids in terms of forbidden series minors, and we give a new matroid axiom system that is built around a modification of SSCE.</description>

      <title>Algebraic connectivity in normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The algebraic connectivity of a graph $G$ in a finite dimensional real normed linear space $X$ is a geometric counterpart to the Fiedler number of the graph and can be regarded as a measure of the rigidity of the graph in $X$. We analyse the behaviour of the algebraic connectivity of $G$ in $X$ with respect to graph decomposition, vertex deletion and isometric isomorphism, and provide a general bound expressed in terms of the geometry of $X$ and the Fiedler number of the graph. Particular focus is given to the space $\ell_\infty^d$ where we present explicit formulae and calculations as well as upper and lower bounds. As a key tool, we show that the monochrome subgraphs of a complete framework in $\ell_\infty^d$ are odd-hole-free. Connections to redundant rigidity are also presented.</description>

      <title>Chromatic MacMahon symmetric functions of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A MacMahon symmetric function is an invariant of the diagonal action of the symmetric group on power series in multiple alphabets of variables. We introduce an analogue of the chromatic symmetric function for vertex-weighted graphs, taking values in the MacMahon symmetric functions on two sets of variables, recording information about both cardinalities and weights of vertex sets. We prove that the chromatic symmetric MacMahon function of a tree determines the generating function for its vertex subsets by cardinality, weight, and the numbers of internal and external edges. This result generalizes the one for the unweighted case, first conjectured by Crew and proved independently by Aliste-Prieto--Martin--Wagner--Zamora and Liu--Tang.</description>

      <title>On the Undecidability of Tiling the $3$-dimensional Space with a Set of $3$ Polycubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translational tiling problems are among the most fundamental and representative undecidable problems in all fields of mathematics. Greenfeld and Tao obtained two remarkable results on the undecidability of translational tiling in recent years. One is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in a space of sufficiently large dimension. The other is the undecidability of translational tiling of periodic subsets of space with a single tile, provided that the dimension of the space is part of the input. These two results support the following conjecture: there is a fixed dimension $n$ such that translational tiling with a single tile is undecidable. One strategy towards solving this conjecture is to prove the undecidability of translational tiling of a fixed dimension space with a set of $k$ tiles, for a positive integer $k$ as small as possible. In this paper, it is shown that translational tiling the $3$-dimensional space with a set of $3$ polycubes is undecidable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all stack-sorting polytopes are simplices. Furthermore, we show that the stack-sorting polytopes generated from $Ln1$ permutations have relative volume 1. We establish an upper bound for the number of lattice points in a stack-sorting polytope. In particular, stack-sorting polytopes generated from $2Ln1$ permutations have no interior points.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Optimal Strategies in a Combinatorial Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a combinatorial game derived from a problem in the German National Mathematics Competition. In this game, two players take turns removing numbers from a finite set of natural numbers, aiming to satisfy a certain divisibility condition. We introduce a generalized version of the original game, which depends on two parameters: the size of the initial number set and a fixed divisor. For both players, we identify a broad range of game variants in which they can force a win. In particular, we show that for even-sized sets, the second player to move can always win, while for many odd-sized cases, the first player to move has a winning strategy. A web implementation of the game demonstrates some of our results in practice.</description>

      <title>chipfiring: A Python Package for Efficient Mathematical Analysis of Chip-Firing Games on Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00269v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents `chipfiring`, a comprehensive Python package for the mathematical analysis of chip-firing games on finite graphs. The package provides a robust toolkit for defining graphs and chip configurations (divisors), performing chip-firing operations, and analyzing fundamental properties such as winnability, linear equivalence, and divisor rank. We detail the core components of the library, including its object-oriented graph and divisor implementations, integrated Laplacian matrix computations, and an efficient implementation of Dhar's algorithm for determining the solvability of the dollar game. The `chipfiring` package is designed for researchers and students in graph theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry, providing essential algorithms and data structures for exploring these rich mathematical models. We describe the library's architecture, illustrate its usage with comprehensive examples, and highlight its specialized contributions compared to general-purpose graph libraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that supports of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials are $M$-convex. As a consequence, we resolve a 2019 conjecture of Monical, Tokcan, and Yong that they have the saturated Newton polytope property. As a further consequence, we prove that the moment polytopes of affine Schubert varieties in the affine Grassmannian of type $\mathrm{GL}$ are generalized permutahedra.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for any graph $F$ and $\eta&gt;0$, there exists a $d_0=d_0(F,\eta)$ such that every $n$-vertex $d$-regular graph with $d \geq d_0$ has a collection of vertex-disjoint $F$-subdivisions covering at least $(1-\eta)n$ vertices. This verifies a conjecture of Verstra\"ete from 2002 and improves a recent result of Letzter, Methuku and Sudakov which additionally required $d$ to be at least polylogarithmic in $n$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Turan number with given size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Tur\'an problem with given size, denoted as $\mathrm{mex}(m,K_r,F)$, determines the maximum number of $K_r$-copies in an $F$-free graph with $m$ edges. We prove that for $r\ge 3$ and $\alpha\in(\frac 2 r,1]$, any graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $\Omega(m^{\frac{\alpha r}{2}})$ $K_r$-copies has a subgraph of order $n_0=\Omega(m^\frac{\alpha}{2})$, which contains $\Omega(n_0^{\frac{i(r-2)\alpha}{(2-\alpha)r-2}})$ $K_i$-copies for each $i = 2, \ldots, r$. This implies an upper bound of $\mathrm{mex}(m, K_r, F)$ when an upper bound of $\mathrm{ex}(n,K_r,F)$ is known. Furthermore, we establish an improved upper bound of $\mathrm{mex}(m, K_r, F)$ by $\mathrm{ex}(n, F)$ and $\min_{v_0 \in V(F)} \mathrm{ex}(n, K_r, F - v_0)$. As a corollary, we show $\mathrm{mex}(m, K_r, K_{s,t}) = \Theta( m^{\frac{rs - \binom{r}{2}}{2s-1}} )$ for $r \geq 3$, $s \geq 2r-2$ and $t \geq (s-1)! + 1$, and obtain non-trivial bounds for other graph classes such as complete $r$-partite graphs and $K_s \vee C_\ell$, etc.</description>

      <title>Clubs in projective spaces and three-weight rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear sets over finite fields are central objects in finite geometry and coding theory, with deep connections to structures such as semifields, blocking sets, KM-arcs, and rank-metric codes. Among them, $i$-clubs, a class of linear sets where all but one point (which has weight $i$) have weight one, have been extensively studied in the projective line but remain poorly understood in higher-dimensional projective spaces. In this paper, we investigate the geometry and algebraic structure of $i$-clubs in projective spaces. We establish upper bounds on their rank by associating them with rank-metric codes and analyzing their parameters via MacWilliams identities. We also provide explicit constructions of $i$-clubs that attain the maximum rank for $i \geq m/2$, and we demonstrate the existence of non-equivalent constructions when $i \leq m-2$. The special case $i = m-1$ is fully classified. Furthermore, we explore the rich geometry of three-weight rank-metric codes, offering new constructions from clubs and partial classification results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate multivariate Tutte polynomials, dichromatic polynomials, subset-corank polynomials, size-corank polynomials, and rank generating polynomials of semimatroids, which generalize the corresponding polynomial invariants of graphs and matroids. We primarily establish their deletion-contraction recurrences, basis activities expansions, and various convolution identities. These findings naturally extend Kook-Reiner-Stanton's convolution formula and Kung's convolution-multiplication identities for the Tutte polynomials of graphs and matroids to semimatroids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ternary graph is a graph with no induced cycles of length $0$ modulo $3$. It was recently shown that, if the independence complex of a ternary graph is not contractible, then it is homotopy equivalent to a sphere. When a ternary graph also does not contain induced cycles of length $1$ modulo $3$, we prove that the dimension of the sphere is equal to the dimension of a minimum maximal simplex of the independence complex, or equivalently, to the value obtained by subtracting $1$ from the independent domination number of the graph. The same statement holds if we replace the independent domination number with the domination number. We also give a hypergraph analogue of the statement above.</description>

Abstract: We prove an optimal strategy for the children's game Guess Who? assuming the official rules are in use and that both players ask `classical' questions with a bipartite response. Applying a technique described in [Rabern, B \&amp; Rabern, L 2008, 'A simple solution to the hardest logic puzzle ever', \textit{Analysis}, vol. 68, no. 2, pp.~105-112.] allows for questions with tripartite responses; we explain this innovation and give an optimal strategy for two players applying it.</description>

Abstract: We extend the multivariate Fa\`{a} di Bruno formula to the super case, where anticommuting odd coordinates are considered. The formula takes the same form as the classical case but contains some nontrivial signs, which essentially measure the failure to order the odd factors and derivatives optimally. As a quick application, we obtain an explicit combinatorial formula for the generalized super Bell polynomials, defined by Fan and Hon.</description>

      <title>A logical implication between two conjectures on matrix permanents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a logical implication between two old conjectures stated by Bapat and Sunder about the permanent of positive semidefinite matrices. Although Drury has recently disproved both conjectures, this logical implication yields a non-trivial link between two seemingly unrelated conditions that a positive semidefinite matrix may fulfill. As a corollary, the classes of matrices that are known to obey the first conjecture are then immediately proven to obey the second one. Conversely, we uncover new counterexamples to the first conjecture by exhibiting a previously unknown type of counterexamples to the second conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of the Graph-Structural and Optimization-Based Characterizations of Popular Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular matchings provide a model of matching under preferences in which a solution corresponds to a Condorcet winner in voting systems. In a bipartite graph in which the vertices have preferences over their neighbours, a matching is defined to be popular if it does not lose in a majority vote against any matching. In this paper, we study the following three primary problems: only the vertices on one side have preferences; a generalization of this problem allowing ties in the preferences; and the vertices on both sides have preferences. A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings is how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires exponential time if the definition is simply applied. In the literature, we have the following two types of characterizations: a graph-structural characterization; and an optimization-based characterization described by maximum-weight matchings. The graph-structural characterizations are specifically designed for each problem and provide a combinatorial structure of the popular matchings. The optimization-based characterizations work in the same manner for all problems, while they do not reveal the structure of the popular matchings. A main contribution of this paper is to provide a direct connection of the above two types of characterizations for all of the three problems. Specifically, we prove that each characterization can be derived from the other, without relying on the fact that they characterize popular matchings. Our proofs offer a comprehensive understanding of the equivalence of the two types of characterizations, and suggest a new interpretation of the graph-structural characterization in terms of the dual optimal solution for the maximum-weight matching problem.</description>

      <title>Persistent Quantum Memory in Iterated Lifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum coherence in continuous-time quantum walks on perfect graphs generated by the symmetric lift ${\mathrm{HL}}'_2(G)$, a canonical, unweighted, undirected construction defined as the line graph of a bipartite double cover of $G$. This lift acts as both a coherence-preserving and coherence-inducing transformation: it preserves and scales structured quantum interference in highly symmetric base graphs, and induces sustained coherence in random or weakly structured ones.
  In small graphs such as $K_4$, $K_5$, and the Petersen graph, where quantum walks exhibit sharp revivals and high return probability, repeated $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting produces towers of perfect graphs with thousands to tens of thousands of vertices that retain periodic or quasi-periodic coherence. When applied to random regular or Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs with flat or decaying return behavior, the lift introduces structured interference and significant amplification of mean and peak return probabilities.
  To quantify these effects, we evaluate standard coherence metrics from quantum resource theory, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), purity, relative entropy of coherence, and the logarithmic coherence number. These measures confirm that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting delocalizes eigenstates, increases coherence entropy, and expands the basis support of quantum states. These results demonstrate that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ is a scalable and structurally grounded mechanism for organizing quantum interference, and introduce a new family of perfect graphs that support long-time quantum coherence without spectral tuning or engineered weights.</description>

Abstract: We provide a topological characterization of quivers whose path algebra satisfies a polynomial identity. This class includes the oriented cycle and acyclic quivers and, in the latter case, we describe the associated T-ideal. We introduce a generalization of Arnold's A-graded algebras, which we call locally A-graded algebras, and prove that they are also PI. We give an example of a quiver algebra satisfying a polynomial identity, even if the path algebra of the quiver does not.</description>

      <title>Graphs with tree decompositions of small graphs and realizing them as the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have been interested in graphs and realizing them as Reeb graphs of explicit real algebraic functions.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the quotient space of the manifold of the domain, regarded as the space consisting of all components of preimages of all single points. Reeb graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry of manifolds since the birth of theory of Morse functions, in the former half of the 20th century. We can easily see that the Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere whose dimension is at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and two edges.
  We are concerned with realizations of graphs decomposed into trees nicely, each vertex of which corresponds to a graph with exactly one edge and two edges or a graph with exactly two edges homeomorphic to a circle.</description>

Abstract: We describe the Coxeter permutahedra, recently studied by Ardila, Castillo, Eur and Postnikov, in terms of random Coxeter tournaments, which involve cooperative and solitaire games, as well as the usual competitive games in graph tournaments. In this way, we establish a Coxeter version of Moon's theorem on random tournaments. We present a geometric proof by the Mirsky--Thompson generalized Birkhoff's theorem, a probabilistic proof by Strassen's coupling theorem, and an algorithmic proof by a Coxeter analogue of the Havel--Hakimi algorithm. These proofs have interpretations in terms of players choosing competitors/collaborators with respect to relative weakness/strength. We also introduce a natural Coxeter analogue of the Bradley--Terry model, from the statistical theory of paired comparisons.</description>

      <title>A Consistent Sandpile Torsor Algorithm for Regular Matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every regular matroid is associated with a sandpile group, which acts simply transitively on the set of bases in various ways. Ganguly and the second author introduced the notion of consistency to describe classes of actions that respect deletion-contraction in a precise sense, and proved the consistency of rotor-routing torsors (and uniqueness thereof) for plane graphs.
  In this work, we prove that the class of actions introduced by Backman, Baker, and the fourth author, is consistent for regular matroids. More precisely, we prove the consistency of its generalization given by Backman, Santos and the fourth author, and independently by the first author. This extends the above existence assertion, as well as makes progress on the goal of classifying all consistent actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of when a chromatic quasisymmetric function (CQF) $X_G(x;q)$ of a graph $G$ is in fact symmetric. We first prove the remarkable fact that if a product of two quasisymmetric functions $f$ and $g$ in countably infinitely many variables is symmetric, then in fact $f$ and $g$ must be symmetric. This allows the problem to be reduced to the case of connected graphs.
  We then show that any labeled graph having more than one source or sink has a nonsymmetric CQF. As a corollary, we find that all trees other than a directed path have a nonsymmetric CQF. We also show that a family of graphs we call ''mixed mountain graphs'' always have symmetric CQF.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a chessboard puzzle of Dudeney, the general position problem in graph theory asks for a largest set $S$ of vertices in a graph such that no three elements of $S$ lie on a common shortest path. The number of vertices in such a largest set is the \emph{general position number} of the graph. This paper provides a survey of this rapidly growing problem, which now has an extensive literature. We cover exact results for various graph classes and the behaviour of the general position number under graph products and operations. We also discuss interesting variations of the general position problem, including those corresponding to different graph convexities, as well as dynamic, fractional, colouring and game versions of the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $\Gamma$ is said to be stable if $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma\times K_2)\cong\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and unstable otherwise. If an unstable graph is connected, non-bipartite and any two of its distinct vertices have different neighbourhoods, then it is called nontrivially unstable. We establish conditions guaranteeing the instability of various graph products, including direct products, direct product bundles, Cartesian products, strong products, semi-strong products, and lexicographic products. Inspired by a condition for the instability of direct product bundles, we propose a new sufficient condition for circulant graphs to be unstable and refine existing instability conditions from the literature. Based on these results, we categorize unstable circulant graphs into two distinct types and further propose a classification framework.</description>

      <title>Sums along the edges of bounded degree graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $(H,+)$ be an abelian group. What is the minimum size ${\sf S}_H(G)$ of the set of all sums $A(u)+A(v)$ over all injections $A:V(G)\to H$? In 2012, the first author, Angel, the second author, and Lubetzky proved that, for expander graphs and $H=\mathbb{Z}$, this minimum is at least $\Omega(\log n)$, and this bound is tight -- there exists a regular expander $G$ with ${\sf S}_{\mathbb{Z}}(G)=O(\log n)$. We prove that, for every constant $d\geq 3$, the random $d$-regular graph $\mathcal{G}_{n,d}$ has significantly larger sum-sets: with high probability, for every abelian group $H$, ${\sf S}_H(\mathcal{G}_{n,d})=\Omega(n^{1-2/d})$. In particular, this proves that, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a regular graph with $O(n)$ edges and with sum-sets of size at least $n^{1-\varepsilon}$, for all abelian groups.
  The bound ${\sf S}_H(\mathcal{G}_{n,d})=\Omega(n^{1-2/d})$ is tight up to a polylogarithmic factor: We show that, for every $3\leq d\leq \ln n/ \ln \ln n$, there exists an abelian group $H$ such that, for every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $d$, ${\sf S}_H(G) \leq n^{1-2/d}(\log n)^{O(1)}$.
  We also prove that, for $d\gg\ln^2 n$, with high probability, for every abelian group $H$, ${\sf S}_H(\mathcal{G}_{n,d})=n(1-o(1))$ and determine the second-order term, up to a polylogarithmic factor.</description>

Abstract: We prove a relatively simple combinatorial characterization of simplicial $d$-spheres on $d+4$ vertices. Our criteria are given in terms of the intersection patterns of a simplicial complex's family of minimal non-faces. Namely, let $\Sigma$ be a simplicial complex on $d+4$ vertices and let $\mathcal{F}$ be its family of minimal non-faces. Then $\Sigma$ is a $d$-sphere if and only if $|\mathcal{F}|=n\geq 3$ is odd and there is an ordering $A_0,\ldots, A_{n-1}$ of the minimal non-faces, indices taken modulo $n$, such that successive $A_i$ are disjoint and the alternating $\frac{(n-1)}{2}$-fold intersections $A_i\cap A_{i+2} \cap A_{i+4} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i+n-3}$ partition the vertex set.</description>

      <title>Bipartite graphs with minimum degree at least 15 are antimagic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An antimagic {labeling} of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a one-to-one mapping $f: E\rightarrow\{1,2,\ldots,|E|\}$, ensuring that the vertex sums in $V$ are pairwise distinct, where a vertex sum of a vertex $v$ is defined as the sum of the labels of the edges incident to $v$. A graph is called antimagic if it admits an antimagic labeling. The Antimagic Labeling Conjecture, proposed by Hartsfield and Ringel in 1990, posits that every connected graph other than $K_2$ is antimagic. The conjecture was confirmed for graphs of average degree at least 4,182 in 2016 by Eccles, where it was stated that a similar approach could not reduce the bound below 1,000 from 4,182.
  This paper shows that every bipartite graph with minimum degree at least 15 is antimagic. Our approach relies on three tools: a consequence of K\"{o}nig's Theorem, the existence of a subgraph of a specific size that avoids Eulerian components, and a labeling lemma that ensures some vertex sums are divisible by three while others are not.</description>

      <title>Regularity and multiplicity of Veronese type algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the algebra of Veronese type. We show that the presentation ideal of this algebra has an initial ideal whose Alexander dual has linear quotients. As an application, we explicitly obtain the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the Veronese type algebra. Furthermore, we give an effective upper bound on the multiplicity of this algebra.</description>

      <title>Brown functors of directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any digraph Brown functor -- i.e. a contravariant functor from the homotopy category of finite directed graphs to the category of abelian groups, satisfying the triviality axiom, the additivity axiom, and the Mayer-Vietoris axiom -- is representable. Furthermore, we show that the first path cohomology functor is a digraph Brown functor.</description>

      <title>On plus-one generated arrangements of plane conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi-homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus-one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi-homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus-one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements - that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>
