      <title>Putatively optimal projective spherical designs with little apparent symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give some new explicit examples of putatively optimal projective spherical designs. i.e., ones for which there is numerical evidence that they are of minimal size. These form continuous families, and so have little apparent symmetry in general, which requires the introduction of new techniques for their construction. New examples of interest include an 11-point spherical (3, 3)-design for R 3 , and a 12-point spherical (2, 2)-design for R 4 given by four Mercedes-Benz frames that lie on equi-isoclinic planes. We also give results of an extensive numerical study to determine the nature of the real algebraic variety of optimal projective real spherical designs, and in particular when it is a single point (a unique design) or corresponds to an infinite family of designs.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Cuts are the Exception in BDF-GIRGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of geometry has proven instrumental in the efforts towards more realistic models for real-world networks. In Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs), Euclidean Geometry induces clustering of the vertices, which is widely observed in networks in the wild. Euclidean Geometry in multiple dimensions however restricts proximity of vertices to those cases where vertices are close in each coordinate. We introduce a large class of GIRG extensions, called BDF-GIRGs, which capture arbitrary hierarchies of the coordinates within the distance function of the vertex feature space. These distance functions have the potential to allow more realistic modeling of the complex formation of social ties in real-world networks, where similarities between people lead to connections. Here, similarity with respect to certain features, such as familial kinship or a shared workplace, suffices for the formation of ties. It is known that - while many key properties of GIRGs, such as log-log average distance and sparsity, are independent of the distance function - the Euclidean metric induces small separators, i.e. sublinear cuts of the unique giant component in GIRGs, whereas no such sublinear separators exist under the component-wise minimum distance. Building on work of Lengler and Todorovi\'{c}, we give a complete classification for the existence of small separators in BDF-GIRGs. We further show that BDF-GIRGs all fulfill a stochastic triangle inequality and thus also exhibit clustering.</description>

      <title>Tropical Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a gradient descent method for solving optimisation problems arising in settings of tropical geometry - a variant of algebraic geometry that has become increasingly studied in applications such as computational biology, economics, and computer science. Our approach takes advantage of the polyhedral and combinatorial structures arising in tropical geometry to propose a versatile approach for approximating local minima in tropical statistical optimisation problems - a rapidly growing body of work in recent years. Theoretical results establish global solvability for 1-sample problems and a convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{k})$. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's superior performance over classical descent for tropical optimisation problems which exhibit tropical convexity but not classical convexity. Notably, tropical descent seamlessly integrates into advanced optimisation methods, such as Adam, offering improved overall performance.</description>

      <title>Llarull's theorem on punctured sphere with $L^\infty$ metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Llarull theorem states that a smooth metric on $n$-sphere cannot have scalar curvature no less than $n(n-1)$ and dominate the standard spherical metric at the same time unless it is the standard spherical metric. In this work, we prove that Llarull's rigidity theorem holds for $L^{\infty}$ metrics on spheres with finitely many points punctured. This is related to a question of Gromov.</description>

      <title>Equality conditions for the fractional superadditive volume inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While studying set function properties of Lebesgue measure, F. Barthe and M. Madiman proved that Lebesgue measure is fractionally superadditive on compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In doing this they proved a fractional generalization of the Brunn-Minkowski-Lyusternik (BML) inequality in dimension $n=1$. In this paper we will prove the equality conditions for the fractional superadditive volume inequalites for any dimension. The non-trivial equality conditions are as follows. In the one-dimensional case we will show that for a fractional partition $(\mathcal{G},\beta)$ and nonempty sets $A_1,\dots,A_m\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, equality holds iff for each $S\in\mathcal{G}$, the set $\sum_{i\in S}A_i$ is an interval. In the case of dimension $n\geq2$ we will show that equality can hold if and only if the set $\sum_{i=1}^{m}A_i$ has measure $0$.</description>

      <title>Bishop-Jones' Theorem and the ergodic limit set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a proper, Gromov-hyperbolic metric space and a discrete, non-elementary, group of isometries, we define a natural subset of the limit set at infinity of the group called the ergodic limit set. The name is motivated by the fact that every ergodic measure which is invariant for the geodesic flow on the quotient metric space is concentrated on geodesics with endpoints belonging to the ergodic limit set. We refine the classical Bishop-Jones' Theorem proving that the packing dimension of the ergodic limit set coincides with the critical exponent of the group.</description>

      <title>Exact Exponents for Concentration and Isoperimetry in Product Polish Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational formulas for the asymptotic exponents (i.e., convergence rates) of the concentration and isoperimetric functions in the product Polish probability space under certain mild assumptions. These formulas are expressed in terms of relative entropies (which are from information theory) and optimal transport cost functionals (which are from optimal transport theory). Hence, our results verify an intimate connection among information theory, optimal transport, and concentration of measure or isoperimetric inequalities. In the concentration regime, the corresponding variational formula is in fact a dimension-free bound in the sense that this bound is valid for any dimension. A cardinality bound for the alphabet of the auxiliary random variable in the expression of the asymptotic isoperimetric exponent is provided, which makes the expression computable by a finite-dimensional program for the finite alphabet case. We lastly apply our results to obtain an isoperimetric inequality in the classic isoperimetric setting, which is asymptotically sharp under certain conditions. The proofs in this paper are based on information-theoretic and optimal transport techniques.</description>
