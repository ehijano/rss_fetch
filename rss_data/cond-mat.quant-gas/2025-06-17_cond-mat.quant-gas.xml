      <title>Trion formation and ordering in the attractive SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in microwave shielding have increased the stability and control of large numbers of polar molecules, allowing for the first realization of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate. Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.</description>

      <title>Multi-state detection and spatial addressing in a microscope for ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurement of the particle number, spatial distribution and internal state is fundamental to all proposed experiments with ultracold molecules both in bulk gases and optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate in-situ detection of individual molecules in a bulk sample of 87Rb133Cs molecules. Extending techniques from atomic quantum gas microscopy, we pin the molecules in a deep two-dimensional optical lattice and, following dissociation, collect fluorescence from the constituent atoms using a high-numerical-aperture objective. This enables detection of individual molecules up to the resolution of the sub-micron lattice spacing. Our approach provides direct access to the density distribution of small samples of molecules, allowing us to obtain precise measurements of density-dependent collisional losses. Further, by mapping two internal states of the molecule to different atomic species, we demonstrate simultaneous detection of the position and rotational state of individual molecules. Finally, we implement local addressing of the sample using a focused beam to induce a spatially-dependent light shift on the rotational transitions of the molecules.</description>

      <title>Exact Renormalization Relation and Binding Energies for Three Identical Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the low-energy limit, non-relativistic particles with short-range interactions exhibit universal behavior that is largely independent of microscopic details. This universality is typically described by effective field theory, in which the two-body interaction is renormalized to a single parameter-the scattering length. For systems of identical bosons, the three-body problem reveals the Efimov effect, a novel phenomenon proposed that necessitates the introduction of an additional three-body parameter. However, the exact relation between this three-body parameter, the coupling constants in the effective field theory, and the binding energies of Efimov states remains unresolved. In this Letter, we address this question through a comprehensive analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation with a finite cutoff. We establish an exact renormalization relation for the three-body parameter and determine its connection to the energies of Efimov bound states. These results are validated through high-precision numerical simulations. We expect our findings to be of fundamental interest across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics, and to have broad applications in both few-body and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multiple-species mixture of interacting bosons, $N_1$ bosons of mass $m_1$, $N_2$ bosons of mass $m_2$, and $N_3$ bosons of mass $m_3$ in a harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$. The corresponding intraspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{11}$, $\lambda_{22}$, and $\lambda_{33}$, and the interspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{12}$, $\lambda_{13}$, and $\lambda_{23}$. When the shape of all interactions are harmonic, this is the generic multiple-species harmonic-interaction model which is exactly solvable. We start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the ground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all parameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and interspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the reduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them, thus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)]. The respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each species. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the respective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a mixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling the fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example exploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species interacts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the fragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between species $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each other. We thereby highlight properties of fragmentation that only appear in the multiple-species mixture. Further applications are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Properties of Long-Range Impurities in a Bose Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An impurity immersed in a Bose condensate can form a quasiparticle known as a Bose polaron. When the impurity-boson interaction is short-ranged, the quasiparticle's properties are universal, characterized - independent of the bath density $n_0$ - by the impurity-boson scattering length $a_{IB}$. Long-ranged interactions - such as provided by Rydberg or ionic impurities - introduce an effective interaction range $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and boson-boson interactions provide a third length scale, the condensate coherence length $\xi $. These competing length scales raise the question of whether a universal description remains valid across different bath densities. In this study, we discuss the quasiparticle nature of long-range impurities and its dependence on the length scales $ n_0^{-1/3} $, $ r_{\mathrm{eff}} $, and $ \xi $. We employ two complementary theories - the coherent state Ansatz and the perturbative Gross-Pitaevskii theory - which incorporate beyond-Fr\"ohlich interactions. We derive an analytical expression for the beyond-Fr\"ohlich effective mass for a contact interaction and numerically compute the effective mass for long-range impurities. We argue that the coupling parameter $ |a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} $ remains the principal parameter governing the properties of the polaron. For weak $ (|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \ll 1) $ and intermediate $ (|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \simeq 1) $ values of the coupling parameter, long-range impurities in a BEC are well-described as quasiparticles with a finite quasiparticle weight and a well-defined effective mass. However, the quasiparticle weight becomes significantly suppressed as the effective impurity volume is occupied by an increasing number of bath particles $ (r_{\mathrm{eff}} n_0^{1/3} \gg 1) $.</description>

      <title>Resonant dynamics of dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model with time-dependent tensor electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, tensor gauge fields and their coupling to fracton phases of matter have attracted more and more research interest, and a series of novel quantum phenomena arising from the coupling has been predicted. In this article, we propose a theoretical scheme to construct a time-dependent rank-2 tensor electric field by introducing a periodically driving quadratic potential in a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, and investigate the dynamics of dipole and fracton excitations when the drive frequency is resonant with the on-site interaction. We find that the dynamics are dominated by the splitting of large dipoles with the photon-assisted correlated tunneling and the movement of small dipoles, both of which can be well controlled by the drive amplitude. Our work provides a possible approach for engineering the dynamics of dipole-conserving quantum systems via tensor gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic scalar field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach for bosons: self-eliminating divergence and pure pair condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an interacting Bose gas with a condensate within the energy-functional formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach. For a contact interaction, we derive a self-consistent solution to the HFB equations that intrinsically eliminates divergence. This solution characterizes the equilibrium state featuring a condensate of correlated pairs of particles. We analyze the temperature dependence of key thermodynamic quantities such as condensate density, chemical potential, entropy, pressure, specific heat capacity at constant volume, and isothermal compressibility and compare them with predictions from the Popov approximation. Our results reveal a first-order phase transition between the normal state and the degenerate state, accompanied by an increased transition temperature relative to the ideal Bose gas. Analysis of the compressibility indicates that a pure pair condensate is unstable, and the stable equilibrium corresponds to a mixture of single-particle and pair condensates.</description>

      <title>Observation of many-body coherence in quasi-one-dimensional attractive Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.</description>

      <title>Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time evolution of the contact parameter provides key insights into correlation dynamics in ultracold gases. However, most contact measurements to date have focused on equilibrium systems or slow, global dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that projecting a unitary Fermi gas onto a low-lying dimer state enables rapid probing of the contact. Using $^{40}$K near a broad s-wave Feshbach resonance, we compare the strength of the dimer-projection feature to the strength of the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy. By tuning the correlation strength through temperature, we find that the dimer signal scales proportionally with the contact parameter, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Our measurements enable us to constrain the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, to which the dimer feature is the dominant contributor. We observe deviations from universal predictions due to finite-range and multichannel effects. Our results establish new universal contact relations and shed light on the structure of the clock shift in strongly interacting Fermi gases. The demonstrated ability to resolve short-range correlations on timescales shorter than the inverse Fermi energy opens new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $&gt;90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits as well as enhanced GHZ state fidelities in analog preparation. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fracton Hydrodynamics of Ultracold Atoms in Partially Filled Landau Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes subdiffusively.The slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.</description>

      <title>Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Illuminating integer quantum Hall matter with polarized light can drive quantum phase transitions. Technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity make such experiments challenging in the solid state. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report experimental results from such a 1D quantum simulator of 2D integer quantum Hall matter driven by light of variable polarization. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an intuitive understanding of the collective low-energy spin excitation of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, known as the spinon. To this end, we demonstrate how a single spinon can be excited by adding one extra spin to the ground state. This procedure accurately reproduces all key features of the spinon's dispersion. These follow from the vanishing norm of the excited state which is triggered by the ground state entanglement. Next, we show that the spinon dispersion can be approximately reproduced if we replace the true ground state with the simplest valence-bond solid. This proves that the spinon of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model can be understood as a single spin flowing through a valence-bond solid.</description>

      <title>Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>
