      <title>Counting topological interface modes using simplicial characteristic classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computational approach for predicting the number of topological interface modes (TIMs) in hermitian systems using the spectral flow - monopole (SFM) correspondence is presented. The number of TIMs is determined by calculating the Chern number of a complex line bundle of local polarisation vectors over a phase space sphere surrounding a Weyl point. The Chern number is computed by constructing the simplicial first Chern class of a discrete vector bundle on a simplicial mesh. This approach is gauge invariant, derivative free, structure preserving, and robust to noise. The algorithm is shown to reproduce the expected number of TIMs for the case of equatorial fluid waves and the topological Langmuir cyclotron wave. The possibility of using this algorithm to analyse experimental measurements of bulk wave polarisations and predict the associated number of TIMs is explored in a synthetic example.</description>

      <title>Realization of Phonon FETs in 2D material through Engineered Acoustic Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-effect transistors (FETs) predominantly utilize electrons for signal processing in modern electronics. In contrast, phonon-based field-effect transistors (PFETs)-which employ phonons for active thermal management-remain markedly underdeveloped, with effectively reversible thermal conductivity modulation posing a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a novel PFET architecture enabling reversible thermal conductivity modulation. This design integrates a substrate in the central region with a two-dimensional (2D) material to form an engineered junction, exploiting differences in out-of-plane acoustic phonon properties to regulate heat flow. Molecular dynamics simulations of a graphene (Gr)/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) junction demonstrate a substantial thermal conductivity reduction up to 44-fold at 100 K. The effect is maintained at room temperature and across diverse substrates, confirming robustness. This work establishes a new strategy for dynamic thermal management in electronics.</description>

      <title>Point-wise Diffusion Models for Physical Systems with Shape Variations: Application to Spatio-temporal and Large-scale system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).</description>

      <title>Frequency Dependent Polarizability for 1D Periodic Systems at Coupled Cluster with Single and Double Excitations Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first implementation of the frequency-dependent electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability for 1D periodic systems computed with the coupled cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) method with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). The implementation is performed in the CCResPy open-source software, based on Python and the NumPy library. The complete equations and many details of the implementation are discussed. The test calculations show the impact on this linear response property of passing from a single molecule to a periodic chain, where the relative magnitude of the polarizability tensor elements is inverted. This work also explores the convergence towards the PBC thermodynamic limit with k-space sampling, and some remaining issues in the definition of the electric dipole operator for periodic systems. This work represents a significant step forward for the simulation of optical response properties for solid-state materials with accurate and systematically improvable quantum mechanical methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient solutions of eigenvalue problems in rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability analysis of the Boltzmann kinetic equation has recently garnered research interest due to its potential applications in space exploration, where rarefaction effects can render the Navier Stokes equations invalid. Since the Boltzmann equation is defined in a seven-dimensional phase space, directly solving the associated eigenvalue problems is computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose an efficient iterative method to solve the linear stability equation of the kinetic equation. The solution process involves both outer and inner iterations. In the outer iteration, the shifted inverse power method is employed to compute selected eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions of interest. For the inner iteration, which involves inverting the high-dimensional system for the velocity distribution function, we adopt our recently developed general synthetic iterative scheme to ensure fast converging and asymptotic preserving properties. As a proof of concept, our method demonstrates both high efficiency and accuracy in planar sound wave and Couette flow. Each eigenpair can be computed with only a few hundred iterations of the kinetic equation, and the spatial cell size can be significantly larger than the molecular mean free path in near-continuum flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Moment Estimate and Variational Approach for Learning Generalized Diffusion with Non-gradient Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven learning framework for identifying governing laws of generalized diffusions with non-gradient components. By combining energy dissipation laws with a physically consistent penalty and first-moment evolution, we design a two-stage method to recover the pseudo-potential and rotation in the pointwise orthogonal decomposition of a class of non-gradient drifts in generalized diffusions. Our two-stage method is applied to complex generalized diffusion processes including dissipation-rotation dynamics, rough pseudo-potentials and noisy data. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning physical laws in non-gradient generalized diffusions.</description>

      <title>Predictive Chemical Kinetic Modeling of Pt-Catalyzed Dry Methane Reforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dry reforming of methane (DRM) over platinum catalysts offers a promising route for CO2 utilization and syngas (H2/CO) production, a versatile feedstock for synthetic fuels. This study employs automated chemical kinetic model generation to present a detailed microkinetic mechanism for Pt-catalyzed DRM between 700-1100 K, identifying key reaction pathways and kinetic limitations through sensitivity analysis.
  Model predictions of CH4 and CO2 conversion and syngas production closely match fixed-bed experimental data across the entire temperature range and varied feed ratios. Our predictive reaction network reveals that OCX serves as a critical bottleneck intermediate for cooperative CH4 and CO2 activation. While CO desorption (OCX &lt;=&gt; CO + X) was identified as the most influential step with strong negative sensitivity toward methane concentration, OCX regeneration (CO2X + CX &lt;=&gt; 2OCX) inhibits methane conversion by maintaining surface saturation.
  Methane activation follows sequential C-H scissions (CH4X -&gt; CH3X -&gt; CH2X -&gt; CHX -&gt; CX), while CO2 activation proceeds predominantly via a hydrogen-mediated carboxyl route (CO2X + HX -&gt; COOHX -&gt; COX + OHX). Three operational regimes were identified: low-temperature desorption-limited kinetics (700-850 K), transitional pathway activation (850-950 K), and high-temperature distributed control with carbon management challenges (950-1300 K).
  These insights provide design principles for platinum-based DRM catalysts, emphasizing temperature-specific optimization strategies. This is the first study to apply fully automated microkinetic model generation to Pt-catalyzed DRM, integrating sensitivity analysis, flux analysis, and surface speciation for catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Efficiency of the Differential Algebra-based Fast Multipole Method Using Symbolic Differential Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) computes pairwise interactions between particles with an efficiency that scales linearly with the number of particles. The method works by grouping particles based on their spatial distribution and approximating interactions with distant regions through series expansions. Differential Algebra (DA), also known as Truncated Power Series Algebra (TPSA), computes the Taylor expansion of a function at a given point and allows users to manipulate Taylor expansions as easily as numerical values in computation. This makes it a convenient and powerful tool for constructing expansions in FMM. However, DA-based FMM operators typically suffer from lower efficiency compared to implementations based on other mathematical frameworks, such as Cartesian tensors or spherical harmonics. To address this, we developed a C++ library for symbolic DA computation, enabling the derivation of explicit expressions for DA-based FMM operators. These symbolic expressions are then used to generate highly optimized code that eliminates the redundant computations inherent in numerical DA packages. For individual FMM operators, this approach achieves a speedup of 20- to 50-fold. We further evaluate the numerical performance of the enhanced DA-FMM and benchmark it against two state-of-the-art FMM implementations, pyfmmlib and the traceless Cartesian tensor-based FMM, for the Coulomb potential. For relative errors on the order of $10^{-7}$ or higher, the enhanced DA-FMM consistently outperforms both alternatives.</description>

      <title>Prime Factorization Equation from a Tensor Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an exact and explicit equation for prime factorization, along with an algorithm for its computation. The proposed method is based on the MeLoCoToN approach, which addresses combinatorial optimization problems through classical tensor networks. The presented tensor network performs the multiplication of every pair of possible input numbers and selects those whose product is the number to be factorized. Additionally, in order to make the algorithm more efficient, the number and dimension of the tensors and their contraction scheme are optimized. Finally, a series of tests on the algorithm are conducted, contracting the tensor network both exactly and approximately using tensor train compression, and evaluating its performance.</description>

      <title>Measuring the entropy of a neuron cell from its membrane current signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate how the entropy of a neuron cell can be measured using membrane ion current signals, which were recorded from neurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The sample entropy and the Scalogram entropy were used as entropy measurement methods. It is well known that the entropy increases in the direction of the movement of the system towards the equilibrium. Therefore, in the process of the electrical activity of a living cell, the entropy is expected to reach a maximum at the moment when the membrane potential reaches the 'Nernst equilibrium potential' (or ionic equilibrium) of the ions. However, it was observed that the entropy values obtained by traditional calculations did not reach the peak at the equilibrium state of the ions. Therefore, two modifications to these measurement methods were proposed to adjust the entropy value to the maximum at the equilibrium potential of the ions. As a result of these proposed modifications, the entropy values were observed to peak around the equilibrium potential of the ions. These refined approaches were successfully validated using the Logistic map. Additionally, the entropy results were compared with Lyapunov exponents. The results show that the behaviour of living cells can be analysed using entropy measurements. The results also suggest that the method could be used to detect differences in the behaviour of tumour and normal cells, or the effects of drugs on cells.</description>

      <title>Multispin Physics of AI Tipping Points and Hallucinations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good (correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024 alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths. Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency, explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users' AI risk and legal liabilities.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Probabilistic Learning of Dynamical Systems from Missing or Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study, we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset, which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks for cavity flows using coordinate transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an alternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep neural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve inverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it remains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with an arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential solution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow condition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes a fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling lid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem, where the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are given. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is used to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with different targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical examples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, and shear deformed geometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the training convergence compared with an un-trained model. A pre-trained model with a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency. These findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling intra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation for nonlinear partial differential equation by Schr\"{o}dingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing that has attracted considerable interest owing to its potential to efficiently solve the governing equations of large-scale classical systems. Exponential speedup through Hamiltonian simulation has been rigorously demonstrated in the case of coupled harmonic oscillators. The question arises as to whether Hamiltonian simulations in other physical systems also accelerate exponentially. Schr\"odingerization is a technique that transforms the governing equations of classical systems into the Schr\"odinger equation. However, since the Schr\"odinger equation is a linear equation, Hamiltonian simulation is often limited to linear equations. The research on Hamiltonian simulation methods for nonlinear governing equations remains relatively limited. In this study, we propose a Hamiltonian simulation method for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed method is named Carleman linearization + Schr\"odingerization (CLS), which combines Carleman linearization (CL) and warped phase transformation (WPT). CL is first applied to transform a nonlinear PDE into a linear differential equation. This linearized equation is then mapped to the Schr\"odinger equation via WPT. The original nonlinear PDE can be solved efficiently by the Hamiltonian simulation of the resulting Schr\"odinger equation. By applying this method, we transform the original governing equation into the Schr\"odinger equation. Solving the transformed Schr\"odinger equation then enables the analysis of the original nonlinear equation. As a specific application, we apply this method to the nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation to demonstrate that Hamiltonian simulations are applicable to nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.</description>

      <title>A Third-Order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory Compact Least-Squares Scheme for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Non-Uniform Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory compact least-squares scheme is developed for the finite volume method on structured curvilinear non-uniform grids. The proposed scheme features compact least-squares reconstruction with optimal linear weights for broad-spectrum accuracy and non-linear weights for essentially non-oscillatory property. Through explicit second-order polynomials given for each control volume, the scheme maintains high accuracy on structured meshes with non-uniform grids. By integrating an improved shock detector developed in this work, coefficients with adaptive levels of dissipation are applied to achieve both the high resolution in smooth regions and high robustness in discontinuous regions. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is extended to the Euler equations through a characteristic decomposition technique. Numerical examples including both linear convection equation and nonlinear Euler/Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the robustness and high-resolution of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Compact Least-Squares and Central Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Structured Curvilinear Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of third- and fifth-order hybrid compact least-squares central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes are proposed and applied to curvilinear structured grids for the finite volume method. In smooth regions, compact least-squares schemes based on interfacial differences of derivatives are utilized to keep the high resolution of multiscale structures, whereas in discontinuous regions, central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes are included to enable the oscillation free shock capturing capability of the hybrid schemes. Free parameters in the proposed compact least-squares schemes are firstly optimized to reach a broad range of resolved bandwidths with different levels of dissipation. In addition, a shock detector proposed in our previous work is introduced and validated to be not only able to detect smooth first-order extrema but also robust in detecting discontinuities. Through the solution of block tridiagonal reconstruction linear systems, the resulting schemes can give an explicit polynomial for each control volume and are efficient with an acceptable computational overhead when compared to the pure central weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes. Eventually, benchmarks including one-dimensional and two-dimensional, linear and nonlinear, inviscid and viscous problems on uniform and nonuniform curvilinear grids demonstrate the proposed schemes' promising applicability in compressible flows which have both multiscale structures and discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Efforts in Modeling the Mechanics and Chemistry of Energetic Materials Across Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments dedicated to the building of multiscale mechanical and chemical constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals are presented and discussed. In particular, various tools have been specifically incorporated in molecular dynamics codes to facilitate the subsequent information transfer to the continuum, i.e. finite elements simulation codes. Atomistic simulations have been augmented with the capability to follow specific deformation paths as well as local Lagrangian mechanical metrics, enabling the computation of materials flow stress surface. This mechanistic library allowed the construction of a comprehensive non-linear hyperelastic continuum model including crystal plasticity and twinning for TATB. Besides, recent advances in analyzing reactive molecular dynamics simulations with unsupervised learning algorithms has enabled the identification and calibration of chemical decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB single crystal. In the present work, the procedure is applied to $\beta$-HMX and extended with the calibration of a multi-components equation of state. These two ingredients are implemented in a finite-element code in order to model the shock-to-detonation transition at the mesoscale level and to study dimensionality effects in quasi-static hotspots. Finally, these dedicated efforts towards a comprehensive multiscale modeling of explosives has also given rise to the need for new prospective experiments, discussed throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Numerical and Experimental Evaluation of Chip Evacuation and Lubricant Flow using Optimized Drill Heads for Ejector Deep Hole Drilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ejector deep hole drilling offers great potential to utilize the typical advantages of deep hole drilling processes on conventional machining centers in a cost-effective and resource-efficient manner. However, maintaining reliable chip evacuation and stable process conditions often relies on high flow volumes of metalworking fluid, resulting in considerable energy consumption in industrial settings. Therefore, to analyze the highly sophisticated chip evacuation dynamics of the process, two flow-optimized drill heads and a reference drill head were evaluated with smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation using experimentally obtained chip shapes. In addition, modified drill heads were additively manufactured and experimentally investigated to validate the numerical results and to determine the positive effect on the necessary fluid flow for a stable ejector drilling process. The modifications aim to improve chip evacuation by reducing vortex formation and optimizing flow conditions near the cutting zone. Therefore, the minimum volume flow required for a stable drilling process without chip clogging is reduced, leading to an energy-efficient sustainable ejector drilling process.</description>

      <title>Numerical Homogenization of Landau-Lifshitz Equation with Rough Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a numerical homogenization approach for the fully nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz equation with rough coefficients, including non-periodicity and nonseparable scales. Direct numerical resolution of such multiscale problems on fine meshes incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient coarse scale approximation through localized basis functions derived from energy minimization within the Generalized Rough Polyharmonic Splines (GRPS) framework. These basis functions preserve critical multiscale features while operating on a computationally tractable coarse mesh. The nonlinear, vectorial, and non-symmetric nature of the Landau-Lifshitz equation necessitates careful design of variational formulations for basis construction. We introduce several such formulations, each tailored to specific structural aspects of the problem. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant computational savings without compromising accuracy, offering a robust framework for simulating multiscale magnetic systems with complex microstructures.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws Surpass Chemical Accuracy for the Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that neural scaling laws can deliver near-exact solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation across a broad range of realistic molecules. This progress is enabled by the Lookahead Variational Algorithm (LAVA), an effective optimization scheme that systematically translates increased model size and computational resources into greatly improved energy accuracy for neural network wavefunctions. Across all tested cases, including benzene, the absolute energy error exhibits a systematic power-law decay with respect to model capacity and computation resources. The resulting energies not only surpass the 1 kcal/mol "chemical-accuracy" threshold but also achieve 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy. Beyond energies, the scaled-up neural network also yields better wavefunctions with improved physical symmetries, alongside accurate electron densities, dipole moments, and other important properties. Our approach offers a promising way forward to addressing many long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry. For instance, we improve energetic properties for systems such as the potential energy curve of nitrogen dimer as dissociation is approached and the cyclobutadiene automerization reaction barrier, producing definitive benchmarks, particularly in regimes where experimental data are sparse or highly uncertain. We also shed light on the decades-old puzzle of the cyclic ozone stability with highly accurate calculations for the cyclic-to-open ozone barrier. These results provide near-exact reference calculations with unprecedented accuracy, universal reliability and practical applicability, establishing a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method for lipid membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Informed Machine Learning for Turbulence Anisotropy Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as part of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear mappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising results for the flat plate case.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Convergence and efficiency proof of quantum imaginary time evolution for bounded order systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many current and near-future applications of quantum computing utilise parametric families of quantum circuits and variational methods to find optimal values for these parameters. Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>evortran: a modern Fortran package for genetic algorithms with applications from LHC data fitting to LISA signal reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: evortran is a modern Fortran library designed for high-performance genetic algorithms and evolutionary optimization. evortran can be used to tackle a wide range of problems in high-energy physics and beyond, such as derivative-free parameter optimization, complex search taks, parameter scans and fitting experimental data under the presence of instrumental noise. The library is built as an fpm package with flexibility and efficiency in mind, while also offering a simple installation process, user interface and integration into existing Fortran (or Python) programs. evortran offers a variety of selection, crossover, mutation and elitism strategies, with which users can tailor an evolutionary algorithm to their specific needs. evortran supports different abstraction levels: from operating directly on individuals and populations, to running full evolutionary cycles, and even enabling migration between independently evolving populations to enhance convergence and maintain diversity. In this paper, we present the functionality of the evortran library, demonstrate its capabilities with example benchmark applications, and compare its performance with existing genetic algorithm frameworks. As physics-motivated applications, we use evortran to confront extended Higgs sectors with LHC data and to reconstruct gravitational wave spectra and the underlying physical parameters from LISA mock data, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic, data-driven scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) exhibit magnetic zigzag edges, while other edge configurations are nonmagnetic. However, when the source, central, and drain regions of a logic device are all composed of zigzag BNRs (ZBNRs), the resulting spin polarization remains weak, unless a high voltage is applied. In this work, we demonstrate that lattice vibrations-introduced for example, via a thermal bath coupled to the central BNR-can enhance spin polarization in ZBNRs. This enhancement manifests as marked changes in the current-voltage characteristics, enabling direct experimental probing. In contrast, nonmagnetic edge configurations exhibit phonon-enhanced charge transport. We employ a tight-binding approach augmented with local electron-phonon interactions described by the Holstein model, and compute the phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents using the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. The mechanism is supported by analyzing both spinless and spinful electronic dispersions and the corresponding density of states. Compared to the phonon-free edges, structural distortions lead to anisotropic electron-phonon couplings, which significantly modify both charge and spin transport. These results position phonon as an effective tuning parameter for optimizing borophene-based logic devices via engineered edge configurations.</description>
