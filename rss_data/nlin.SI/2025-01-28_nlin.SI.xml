      <title>Asymptotic integrability and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief review of the concept of asymptotic integrability, which means that the Hamilton equations for the propagation of short-wavelength packets along a smooth, large-scale background wave have an integral independent of the initial conditions. The existence of such an integral leads to a number of important consequences, which include, besides the direct application to the packets propagation problems, Hamiltonian theory of narrow solitons motion and generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld rule for parameters of solitons produced from an intensive initial pulse. We show that in the case of systems with two wave variables and exact fulfillment of the asymptotic integrability condition, the `quantization' of mechanical systems, associated with the additional integrals, yields the Lax pairs for a number of typical completely integrable equations, and this sheds new light on the origin of the complete integrability in nonlinear wave physics.</description>

      <title>On refactorization problems and rational Lax matrices of quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present rational Lax representations for one-component parametric quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps in both the abelian and non-abelian settings. We show that from the Lax matrices of a general class of non-abelian involutive Yang-Baxter maps ($\mathcal{K}$-list), by considering the symmetries of the $\mathcal{K}$-list maps, we obtain compatible refactorization problems with rational Lax matrices for other classes of non-abelian involutive Yang-Baxter maps ($\Lambda$, $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ lists). In the abelian setting, this procedure generates rational Lax representations for the abelian Yang-Baxter maps of the $F$ and $H$ lists. Additionally, we provide examples of non-involutive (abelian and non-abelian) multi-parametric Yang-Baxter maps, along with their Lax representations, which lie outside the preceding lists.</description>

      <title>Instability bands for periodic traveling waves in the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two families of periodic traveling waves exist in the focusing mKdV (modified Korteweg-de Vries) equation. Spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to co-periodic perturbations of the same period has been previously explored by using spectral analysis and variational formulation. By using tools of integrability such as a relation between squared eigenfunctions of the Lax pair and eigenfunctions of the linearized stability problem, we revisit the spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to perturbations of arbitrary periods. In agreement with previous works, we find that one family is spectrally stable for all parameter configurations, whereas the other family is spectrally unstable for all parameter configurations. We show that the onset of the co-periodic instability for the latter family changes the instability bands from figure-$8$ (crossing at the imaginary axis) into figure-$\infty$ (crossing at the real axis).</description>

      <title>Traveling periodic waves and breathers in the nonlocal derivative NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlocal derivative NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation describes modulations of waves in a stratified fluid and a continuous limit of the Calogero--Moser--Sutherland system of particles. For the defocusing version of this equation, we prove the linear stability of the nonzero constant background for decaying and periodic perturbations and the nonlinear stability for periodic perturbations. For the focusing version of this equation, we prove linear and nonlinear stability of the nonzero constant background under some restrictions. For both versions, we characterize the traveling periodic wave solutions by using Hirota's bilinear method, both on the nonzero and zero backgrounds. For each family of traveling periodic waves, we construct families of breathers which describe solitary waves moving across the stable background. A general breather solution with $N$ solitary waves propagating on the traveling periodic wave background is derived in a closed determinant form.</description>

      <title>On zero-background solitons of the sharp-line Maxwell-Bloch equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is devoted to systematically study general $N$-soliton solutions possibly containing multiple degenerate soliton groups (DSGs), in the context of the sharp-line Maxwell-Bloch equations with a zero background.We also show that results can be readily migrated to other integrable systems, with the same non-self-adjoint Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem or alike. Results for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the complex modified Korteweg-De Vries equation are obtained as explicit examples for demonstrative purposes. A DSG is a localized coherent nonlinear traveling-wave structure, comprised of inseparable solitons with identical velocities. Hence, DSGs are generalizations of single solitons (considered as $1$-DSGs), and form fundamental building blocks of solutions of many integrable systems. We provide an explicit formula for an $N$-DSG and its center. With the help of the Deift-Zhou's nonlinear steepest descent method, we prove the localization of DSGs, and calculate the long-time asymptotics for an arbitrary $N$-soliton solutions. It is shown that the solution becomes a linear combination of multiple DSGs in the distant past and future, with explicit formulae for the asymptotic phase shift for each DSG. Other generalizations of a single soliton are also discussed, such as $N$th-order solitons and soliton gases. We prove that every $N$th-order soliton can be obtained by fusion of eigenvalues of $N$-soliton solutions, with proper rescalings of norming constants, and demonstrate that soliton-gas solution can be considered as limits of $N$-soliton solutions as $N\to+\infty$.</description>
