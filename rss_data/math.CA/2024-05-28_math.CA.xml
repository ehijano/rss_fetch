      <title>Sharp extension inequalities on finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharp restriction theory and the finite field extension problem have both received a great deal of attention in the last two decades, but so far they have not intersected. In this paper, we initiate the study of sharp restriction theory on finite fields. We prove that constant functions maximize the Fourier extension inequality from the parabola $\mathbb{P}^1\subset \mathbb{F}^{2\ast}_q$ and the paraboloid $\mathbb{P}^2\subset \mathbb{F}_q^{3\ast}$ at the euclidean Stein-Tomas endpoint; here, $\mathbb{F}_q^{d\ast}$ denotes the (dual) $d$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb F_q$ with $q=p^n$ elements, where $p$ is a prime number greater than $3$ or $2$, respectively. We fully characterize the maximizers for the $L^2\to L^4$ extension inequality from $\mathbb{P}^2$ whenever $q\equiv 1(\text{mod}\, 4)$. Our methods lead to analogous results on the hyperbolic paraboloid, whose corresponding euclidean problem remains open. We further establish that constants maximize the $L^2\to L^4$ extension inequality from the cone $\Gamma^3:=\{(\boldsymbol{\xi},\tau, \sigma)\in \mathbb{F}^{4\ast}_q: \tau\sigma=\boldsymbol{\xi}^2\}\setminus \{{\bf 0}\}$ whenever $q\equiv 3(\text{mod}\, 4)$. By contrast, we prove that constant functions fail to be critical points for the corresponding inequality on $\Gamma^3\cup \{{\bf 0}\}$ over $\mathbb{F}_p^4$. While some inspiration is drawn from the euclidean setting, entirely new phenomena emerge which are related to the underlying arithmetic and discrete structures.</description>

      <title>Maximal operators given by Fourier multipliers with dilation of fractional dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate $L^p$ bounds of maximal Fourier multiplier operators with dilation of fractional dimensions. For the Fourier multipliers, we suggest a criterion related to dimensions of dilation sets which guarantees $L^p$ bounds of the maximal operators for each $p$. Our criterion covers Mikhlin-type multipliers, multipliers with limited decay, and multipliers with slow decay.</description>

      <title>Approximation processes by multidimensional Bernstein-type exponential polynomials on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new family of Bernstein-type exponential polynomials on the hypercube $[0, 1]^d$ and study their approximation properties. Such operators fix a multidimensional version of the exponential function and its square. In particular, we prove uniform convergence, by means of two different approaches, as well as a quantitative estimate of the order of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity of the approximated function.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula of the parameter dependence of de partial derivatives of the Green's functions related to arbitrary two-point boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain an explicit formula of the parameter dependence of the partial derivatives of the Green's functions related to two-point boundary conditions. Such expression follows as an integral of both kernels times the difference of the corresponding parameters of each Green's function. As a direct consequence, we deduce a simpler proof of the monotony of the constant sign of the partial derivative of a Green's function with respect to a real parameter. As a consequence, we improve the results obtained in \cite{C1}, where the monotone dependence was proved for the constant sign Green's function (not for any ot its partial derivatives) and under weaker assumptions on the Green's function. The arguments are valid for any other types of Ordinary Differential Equations coupled to Nonlocal Conditions. Moreover, analogous ideas could be developed for Partial and Fractional Differential Equations.</description>

      <title>n-th Root Optimal Rational Approximants to Functions with Polar Singular Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $ D $ be a bounded Jordan domain and $ A $ be its complement on the Riemann sphere. We investigate the $ n $-th root asymptotic behavior in $ D $ of best rational approximants, in the uniform norm on $ A $, to functions holomorphic on $ A $ having a multi-valued continuation to quasi every point of $ D $ with finitely many branches. More precisely, we study weak$^*$ convergence of the normalized counting measures of the poles of such approximants as well as their convergence in capacity. We place best rational approximants into a larger class of $ n $-th root optimal meromorphic approximants, whose behavior we investigate using potential-theory on certain compact bordered Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>On a Generalized Moment Integral containing Riemann's Zeta Function: Analysis and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we study both analytically and numerically, an integral $Z(\sigma,r)$ related to the mean value of a generalized moment of Riemann's zeta function. Analytically, we predict finite, but discontinuous values and verify the prediction numerically, employing a modified form of Ces\`aro summation. Further, it is proven and verified numerically that for certain values of $\sigma$, the derivative function $Z^{\prime}(\sigma,n)$ equates to one generalized tine of the Dirac comb function without recourse to the use of limits, test functions or distributions. A surprising outcome of the numerical study arises from the observation that the proper integral form of the derivative function is quasi-periodic, which in turn suggests a periodicity of the integrand. This possibility is also explored and it is found experimentally that zeta function values offset (shifted) over certain segments of the imaginary complex number line are moderately auto-correlated.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the weak Shanks conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an example of a function $f$ non-vanishing in the closed bidisk and the affine polynomial minimizing the norm of $1-pf$ in the Hardy space of the bidisk among all affine polynomials $p$. We show that this polynomial vanishes inside the bidisk. This provides a counterexample to the weakest form of a conjecture due to Shanks that has been open since 1980, with applications that arose from digital filter design. This counterexample has a simple form and follows naturally from [7], where the phenomenon of zeros seeping into the unit disk was already observed for similar minimization problems in one variable.</description>

      <title>Log-Noetherian functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of \emph{Log-Noetherian} (LN) functions. These are holomorphic solutions to algebraic differential equations (in several variables) with logarithmic singularities. We prove an upper bound on the number of solutions for systems of LN equations, resolving in particular Khovanskii's conjecture for Noetherian functions. Consequently, we show that the structure ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN}$ generated by LN-functions, as well as its expansion ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$, are effectively o-minimal: definable sets in these structures admit effective bounds on their complexity in terms of the complexity of the defining formulas.
  We show that ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$ contains the horizontal sections of regular flat connections with quasiunipotent monodromy over algebraic varieties. It therefore contains the universal covers of Shimura varieties and period maps of polarized variations of $\mathbb Z$-Hodge structures. We also give an effective Pila-Wilkie theorem for ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$-definable sets. Thus ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$ can be used as an effective variant of ${\mathbb R}_\text{an,exp}$ in the various applications of o-minimality to arithmetic geometry and Hodge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the expected Wasserstein distance between the empirical measure of a Determinantal Point Process and the background volume form. The main DPP studied is the harmonic ensemble, where we get the optimal rate of convergence for homogeneous manifolds of dimension $d\geq 3$, and for two-point homogeneous manifolds. We also discuss some variations of this process on the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.06920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the extrapolation theory of Rubio de Francia on general function spaces. We present endpoint extrapolation results including $A_1$, $A_p$, and $A_\infty$ extrapolation in the context of Banach function spaces, and also on modular spaces. We also include several applications that can be easily obtained using extrapolation: local decay estimates for various operators, Coifman--Fefferman inequalities that can be used to show some known sharp $A_1$ inequalities, Muckenhoupt--Wheeden and Sawyer's conjectures are also presented for many operators, which go beyond Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators. Finally, we obtain two-weight inequalities for Littlewood--Paley operators and Fourier integral operators on weighted Banach function spaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove a compact version of the $T1$ theorem for bi-parameter singular integrals. That is, if a bi-parameter singular integral operator $T$ admits the compact full and partial kernel representations, and satisfies the weak compactness property, the diagonal $\mathrm{CMO}$ condition, and the product $\mathrm{CMO}$ condition, then $T$ can be extended to a compact operator on $L^p(w)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $w \in A_p(\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_2})$. Even in the unweighted setting, it is the first time to give a compact extension of Journ\'{e}'s $T1$ theorem on product spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a characterization of when two expansive matrices yield the same anisotropic local Hardy and inhomogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The characterization is in terms of the coarse equivalence of certain quasi-norms associated to the matrices. For nondiagonal matrices, these conditions are strictly weaker than those classifying the coincidence of the corresponding homogeneous function spaces. The obtained results complete the classification of anisotropic Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces associated to general expansive matrices.</description>

Abstract: For every $p &gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ we construct a uniformly discrete real sequence $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ with $|\lambda_{n+1}| &gt; |\lambda_n|$, a function $g \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$, and continuous linear functionals $\{g^*_n\}$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, such that every $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ admits a series expansion \[ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} g_n^*(f) g(x-\lambda_n) \] convergent in the $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ norm. We also prove a similar result for the space $C_0(\mathbb{R})$, where in this case $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is taken to be the sequence of positive integers.</description>

Abstract: The present book gives a systematic overview of function theory and the theory of Stieltjes integral. In particular, we give a detailed account of the theory of functions of bounded variation and of the theory of regulated functions (= functions having finite one-sided limits at each point of their domain). We also present a detailed discussion of $\sigma$-continuous functions (= functions having at most countable set of points of discontinuity) and of the theory of Riemann-Stieltjes integral. We introduce the notion of *-integral, which allows us to integrate $\sigma$-continuous functions over functions of bounded variation. The limit theorems for *-integral are somewhat more convenient than their analogues for the general Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. Some applications of *-integral are also discussed.</description>

      <title>On gamma functions with respect to the alternating Hurwitz zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1730, Euler defined the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ by the integral representation. It possesses many interesting properties and has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and sciences. According to Lerch, the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ can also be defined by the derivative of the Hurwitz zeta function $$\zeta(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+x)^{z}}$$ at $z=0$. Recently, Hu and Kim defined the corresponding Stieltjes constants $\widetilde{\gamma}_{k}(x)$ and Euler constant $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ from the Taylor series of the alternating Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ $$\zeta_{E}(z,x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+x)^z}.$$ And they also introduced the corresponding Gamma function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$ which has the following Weierstrass--Hadamard type product $$\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)=\frac{1}{x}e^{\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}x}\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{k}}\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right)^{(-1)^{k+1}}.$$
  In this paper, we shall further investigate the function $\widetilde{\Gamma}(x)$, that is, we obtain several properties in analogy to the classical Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$, including the integral representation, the limit representation, the recursive formula, the special values, the log-convexity, the duplication formula and the reflection equation. Furthermore, we also prove a Lerch-type formula, which shows that the derivative of $\zeta_{E}(z,x)$ can be representative by $\widetilde\Gamma(x)$. As an application to Stark's conjecture in algebraic number theory, we will explicit calculate the derivatives of the partial zeta functions for the maximal real subfield of cyclotomic fields at $z=0$.</description>
