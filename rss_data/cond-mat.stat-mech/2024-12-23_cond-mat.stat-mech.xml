      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>The density profile of a Coulomb plasma on a cylinder: boundary oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional one-component plasma (2D OCP) confined to a cylindrical geometry, focusing on density profiles, fluctuations, and their connection to bulk correlation functions. The cylindrical geometry eliminates geometric frustration, allowing for a precise study of boundary density oscillations, the dependence on boundary conditions, and their relationship to the melting transition and triangular lattice structure. By triangulating particle configurations, we quantify the exponential suppression of topological defects in the crystalline phase. Furthermore, we propose an oriented correlation function that better links boundary density profiles with bulk correlation functions, motivating anisotropic generalizations of the phase-field crystal (PFC) model. These results provide new insights into the interplay between boundary effects, bulk correlations, and phase transitions in the 2D OCP.</description>

      <title>Long-range exchange coupling in a magnetic multilayer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explored the magnetic coupling in a multilayer system consisting of thin layers separated by a distance $d$. We have employed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to calculate the thermodynamic quantities such as the magnetization per spin $m_{L}^{\mu}$, magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{L}^{\mu}$, and the reduced fourth-order Binder cumulant $U_{L}^{\mu}$ as a function of temperature $T$ and for several values of lattice size $L$. These quantities were obtained for each layer ($\mu=l)$, for the bulk system ($\mu=b)$, as a function of interlayer distance $d$ and the parameter $\alpha$ that defines the scale length of the exponential decay of the interaction. Furthermore, we applied the finite-size scaling theory to calculate the critical exponents. Our results reveal that the system exhibits 2D Ising exponents when the layers are sufficiently separated. On the other hand, in the compact limit, where $d$ equals the distance between two adjacent sites within the same layer, our bulk results show that the system exhibits 3D Ising critical exponents, provided that the number of layers $L_{z}$ increases proportionally to the layer sizes. Even with the separation increasing up to $d=2.0$, the layers are so correlated that the set of critical exponents retains the values of 3D critical exponents. However, when the number of layers $L_{z}$ remains fixed, even in the compact limit with periodic boundary conditions, only the exponent $\beta$ aligns closely with the predicted literature values, on the other hand, the other exponents show significant deviations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations for the evolution of the order parameter in space and time, such as the Langevin equation. We demonstrate that the ordinary differential equations governing either the temporal or spatial dependence in the Langevin equation provide surprisingly substantial insights into the dynamics of the phase transition. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time, which is crucial to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In particular, Bernoulli differential equations that arise in the overdamped case can be solved analytically. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. Apart from the fundamental insights into the KZM, this finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales, which would otherwise be difficult to achieve with numerical simulations of the full partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Critical Phenomena: Expanding The Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biased quorum-sensing active particles (bQSAPs) are shown to extend notions of dynamic critical phenomena beyond active phase separation into the prototypical nonequilibrium setting of driven transport, where characteristic emergent behaviour is not stationary. To do so, we construct an effective field theory in a single order-parameter -- a non-stationary analogue of active Model B -- which accounts for the fact that different aspects of bQSAPs can only be cast in terms of passive thermodynamics under an appropriate choice of inertial frame. This codifies the movement of phase boundaries due to nonequilibrium fluxes between coexisting bulk phases in terms of a difference in effective chemical potentials and therefore an unequal tangent construction on a bulk free energy density. The result is an anomalous phase structure; binodals are permitted to cross spinodal lines so that criticality is no longer constrained to a single point. Instead, criticality -- with exponents that are seemingly unchanged from symmetric QSAPs -- is shown to exist along a line that marks the entry to an otherwise forbidden region of phase space. The interior of this region is not critical in the conventional sense but retains certain features of criticality, which we term pseudo-critical. Since a Ginzburg criterion cannot be satisfied, fluctuations cannot be ignored, no matter how small, and manifest at the scale of macroscopic features. However, finite-wavenumber fluctuations grow at non-vanishing rates and are characterized by non-trivial dispersion relations. The resulting interplay is used to explain how different areas of phase space correspond to different types of micro- and meso-phase separation.</description>

      <title>Stroboscopic measurements in Markov networks: Exact generator reconstruction vs. thermodynamic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major goal of stochastic thermodynamics is to estimate the inevitable dissipation that accompanies particular observable phenomena in an otherwise not fully accessible system. Quantitative results are often formulated as lower bounds on the total entropy production, which capture the part of the total dissipation that can be determined based on the available data alone. In this work, we discuss the case of a continuous-time dynamics on a Markov network that is observed stroboscopically, i.e., at discrete points in time in regular intervals. We compare the standard approach of deriving a lower bound on the entropy production rate in the steady state to the less common method of reconstructing the generator from the observed propagators by taking the matrix logarithm. Provided that the timescale of the stroboscopic measurements is smaller than a critical value that can be determined from the available data, this latter method is able to recover all thermodynamic quantities like entropy production or cycle affinities and is therefore superior to the usual approach of deriving lower bounds. Beyond the critical value, we still obtain tight upper and lower bounds on these quantities that improve on extant methods. We conclude the comparison with numerical illustrations and a discussion of the requirements and limitations of both methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic field effects in a two-state system: symmetry breaking and symmetry restoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model that incorporates both a time-varying stochastic field and thermal noise in a two-state system. In analyzing data from numerical simulations, we adopt a detailed microscopic approach that goes beyond the standard calculation of the order parameter. Specifically, we measure the probability distribution of the magnetization as a function of temperature and field strength, and compute the time required for the system to jump from one ordered state to the other. These measurements enable us to probe various ordered states in the system and investigate the symmetry breaking and symmetry restoring phenomena underlying the observed phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Estimate of equilibration times of quantum correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit based on Lanczos coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibration times $T_\text{eq}$ of local observables in quantum chaotic systems by considering their auto-correlation functions. Based on the recursion method, we suggest a scheme to estimate $T_\text{eq}$ from the corresponding Lanczos coefficients that is expected to hold in the thermodynamic limit. We numerically find that if the observable eventually shows smoothly growing Lanczos coefficients, a finite number of the former is sufficient for a reasonable estimate of the equilibration time. This implies that equilibration occurs on a realistic time scale much shorter than the life of the universe. The numerical findings are further supported by analytical arguments.</description>

      <title>Persistent self-organized states in non-equilibrium magnetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employed Monte Carlo simulations to study the Ising, $XY$, and Heisenberg models on a simple cubic lattice, where the system models evolve toward the steady state under the influence of competition between one- and two-spin flip dynamics. With probability $q$, the system is in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T$ and evolves toward the lower energy state through one-spin flip dynamics. On the other hand, with probability $1-q$, the system is subjected to an external energy flux that drives it toward the higher energy state through two-spin flip dynamics. As a result, we constructed the phase diagram of $T$ as a function of $q$. In this diagram, we identified the antiferromagnetic ($AF$) ordered phase, the ferromagnetic ($F$) ordered phase, and the disordered paramagnetic ($P$) phase for all the models studied. Through these phases, we observed self-organization phenomena in the systems. For low values of $q$, the system is in the $AF$ phase, and as $q$ increases the system continuously transitions to the $P$ phase. Now, for high values of $q$, the system through continuous phase transitions again reaches an ordered phase, the $F$ phase, at low values of $T$. Additionally, we also calculated the critical exponents of the system, showing that these are not affected by the non-equilibrium regime of the system.</description>

      <title>Integrability versus chaos in the steady state of many-body open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group meets Computational Fluid Dynamics: RG flows in a multi-dimensional field space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) approach, we present a fluid-dynamical approach to solving flow equations for models living in a multi-dimensional field space. To this end, the underlying exact flow equation of the effective potential is reformulated as a set of nonlinear advection-diffusion-type equations which can be solved using the Kurganov-Tadmor central scheme, a modern finite-volume discretization from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing explicit benchmark tests using zero-dimensional models with two discretized field space directions or two symmetry invariants. Our techniques can be directly applied to flow equations of effective potentials of general (fermion-)boson systems with multiple invariants or condensates, as we also demonstrate for two concrete examples in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics is an intensively developing field with many existing applications. We study the dynamics of temperatures and chemical potentials of fermionic reservoirs coupled to an open quantum system. We show that heat transfer from the coldest reservoir to the hottest one is allowed by the Clausius inequality and results in transient cooling of the coldest reservoir without additional external refrigeration. We show that during the establishment of thermal and chemical equilibrium, non-monotone evolution of reservoirs' temperatures and chemical potentials is possible, including changes in reservoirs' temperatures and chemical potentials orderliness. Achieved results can be used in the design of quantum thermal machines and nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Synaptic plasticity alters the nature of chaos transition in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In realistic neural circuits, both neurons and synapses are coupled in dynamics with separate time scales. The circuit functions are intimately related to these coupled dynamics. However, it remains challenging to understand the intrinsic properties of the coupled dynamics. Here, we develop the neuron-synapse coupled quasi-potential method to demonstrate how learning induces the qualitative change in macroscopic behaviors of recurrent neural networks. We find that under the Hebbian learning, a large Hebbian strength will alter the nature of the chaos transition, from a continuous type to a discontinuous type, where the onset of chaos requires a smaller synaptic gain compared to the non-plastic counterpart network. In addition, our theory predicts that under feedback and homeostatic learning, the location and type of chaos transition are retained, and only the chaotic fluctuation is adjusted. Our theoretical calculations are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Heat and work in black hole thermodynamics via holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formulation of black hole thermodynamics that incorporates the notions of heat and work, based on the thermodynamics in quantum theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. First, for coupled holographic CFTs, we define a coarse-graining procedure adopting the principle of maximum entropy. Employing this approach, when the system is divided into a target system and thermal baths, we formulate the first and second laws, as well as the fundamental thermodynamic relation. Then, by translating the resulting thermodynamics into the AdS gravity language, we construct a thermodynamic framework for composite black hole systems that encompasses both heat and work. This formulation relies on holography, but not on energy conditions on the gravity side. We also argue that the second law serves as a necessary criterion for the UV completeness of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the variance of both smooth linear statistics and rough linear statistics (counting statistics) of random normal matrices. The two classical ensembles of random matrices, the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) and the complex Ginibre ensemble, enjoy an exact map to the ground state of noninteracting Fermions in a harmonic trap in one, respectively two dimensions. Both feature that the variance of the number of Fermions (the number variance) in a set $A$, and the respective entanglement entropy are proportional. For the Ginibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial symmetric sets $A$, and we prove it in generality for subsets $A$ of the bulk, thus establishing a holographic principle. Moreover, for generic random normal matrix ensembles depending on some potential $V$, not necessarily exhibiting radial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is proportional to the circumference of $A$, $\sim\sqrt{n}|\partial A|$. A special focus is on the variance of linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, which interpolates between the GUE and Ginibre ensemble, in various regimes of non-Hermiticity, where we enlarge the concept of weak non-Hermiticity to mesoscopic scales. Within the elliptic Ginibre ensemble we prove that for smooth test functions $f$ its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble. The interpolation depends on two positive parameters, the rescaling $\alpha$ of the weak non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau=1-\kappa n^{-\alpha}$, and the rescaling $\gamma$ of the test function $f(n^\gamma z)$, for a continuous range of values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. In the mesoscopic regime and when $\alpha=\gamma&lt;1$, we prove an interpolating central limit theorem with an adaptation of the method of Ward identities.</description>

Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits have attracted significant interest as an example of synthetic quantum matter, intrinsically defined by their quantum information content. Here, we propose a multipartite entanglement perspective on monitored phases through the lens of quantum Fisher information. Our findings reveal that unstructured monitored random circuits fail to exhibit divergent multipartite entanglement even at criticality, highlighting their departure from standard quantum critical behavior. However, we demonstrate that genuinely multipartite entangled phases can be realized through two-site measurements, provided a protection mechanism is in place. This work positions multipartite entanglement as a valuable perspective for the study of interacting monitored circuits and broader frameworks of noisy quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Conserved densities of hard rods: microscopic to hydrodynamic solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of many hard rods moving in one dimension. As it is an integrable system, it possesses an extensive number of conserved quantities and its evolution on macroscopic scale can be described by generalised hydrodynamics. Using a microscopic approach, we compute the evolution of the conserved densities starting from non-equilibrium initial conditions of both quenched and annealed type. In addition to getting reduced to the Euler solutions of the hydrodynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the microscopic solutions can also capture effects of the Navier-Stokes terms and thus go beyond the Euler solutions. We demonstrate this feature from microscopic analysis and numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in two problems -- first, tracer diffusion in a background of hard rods and second, the evolution from a domain wall initial condition in which the velocity distribution of the rods are different on the two sides of the interface. We supplement our analytical results using extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard definition of particle number fluctuations based on point-like particles neglects the excluded volume effect. This leads to a large and systematic finite-size scaling and an unphysical surface term in the isothermal compressibility. We correct these errors by introducing a modified pair distribution function which takes account of the finite size of the particles. For the hard sphere fluid in one-dimension, we show that the compressibility is strictly size-independent and we reproduce this result from the number fluctuations calculated with the new theory. In general, the present method eliminates the leading finite-size effect, which makes it possible to compute density fluctuations accurately in very small sampling volumes, comparable to the single particle size. These findings open the way for obtaining the local compressibility from fluctuation theory at the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics</description>

      <title>Agent-based Modelling of Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this tutorial, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation, in the presence of noise, in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM), and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the behaviour of the quantum players (or, \textit{qubits}) in the thermodynamic limit, and for QuPD, we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighbouring quantum players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \textit{Quantum} and the \textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this tutorial demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behaviour in an infinite-player one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.</description>

      <title>Universal limiting behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems with conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making sense of complex inhomogeneous systems composed of many interacting species is a grand challenge that pervades basically all natural sciences. Phase separation and pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems have been largely studied as two separate paradigms. Here we show that in reaction-diffusion systems composed of many species, the presence of a conservation law constrains the evolution of the conserved quantity to be governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-like equation. This establishes a direct link with the paradigm of coexistence and recent "active" field theories. Hence, even for complex many-species systems a dramatically simplified but accurate description emerges over coarse spatio-temporal scales. Using the nullcline (the line of homogeneous steady states) as the central motif, we develop a geometrical framework which endows chemical space with a basis and suitable coordinates. This framework allows us to capture and understand the effect of eliminating fast non-conserved degrees of freedom, and to explicitly construct coefficients of the coarse field theory. We expect that the theory we develop here will be particularly relevant to advance our understanding of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

      <title>Discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal system with directional interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of coarse-grained descriptions of a system's kinetics is well established in biophysics. One prominent example is Markov state models in protein folding dynamics. In this paper, we develop a coarse-grained, discrete state model of a self-aggregating colloidal particle system inspired by the concepts of Markov state modelling. The specific self-aggregating system studied here involves field-responsive colloidal particles in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. Starting from particle-resolved (Brownian dynamics) simulations, we define the discrete states by categorizing each particle according to it's local structure. We then describe the kinetics between these states as a series of stochastic, memoryless jumps. In contrast to other works on colloidal self-assembly, our coarse-grained approach describes the simultaneous formation and evolution of multiple aggregates from single particles. Our discrete model also takes into account the changes in transition dynamics between the discrete states as the size of the largest cluster grows. We validate the coarse-grained model by comparing the predicted population fraction in each of the discrete states with those calculated directly from the particle-resolved simulations as a function of the largest cluster size. We then predict population fractions in presence of noise-averaging and in a situation where a model parameter is changed instantaneously after a certain time. Finally, we explore the validity of the detailed balance condition in the various stages of aggregation.</description>

Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>
