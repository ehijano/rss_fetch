      <title>Electrohydrodynamics of a pair of leaky dielectric droplets on the solid substrate: A lattice Boltzmann study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the electrohydrodynamics of a pair of leaky dielectric droplets on a solid substrate is investigated by the phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann method. Different from a pair of suspended droplets that may coalesce or separate, two leaky dielectric droplets on the substrate exhibit more complex modes due to the effects of wettability and electric force. The results show that when a horizontal electric field is applied, five different modes with electrostatic attractive force are observed, including attraction without coalescence, attraction with coalescence, coalescence with bubble entrapment, coalescence followed by suspension, and suspension followed by coalescence. Particularly, if the droplets are in a hydrophilic state, the coalescence mode is usually observed, while for droplets in a neutral or hydrophobic state, the permittivity ratio has an important effect on the droplet modes. Additionally, during the coalescence process, two droplets in a hydrophobic state not only capture bubbles, but may also exhibit suspension at a large permittivity ratio or contact angle. On the other hand, when a vertical electric field is applied, there are three different modes with repulsive electrostatic force, including non-coalescence, coalescence, and suspension followed by repulsion. Specially, a small permittivity ratio or a large contact angle can suppress the horizontal deformation of droplets, preventing their coalescence. Moreover, under superhydrophobic conditions, both horizontal and vertical electric fields suspend the droplets. However, the vertical electric field induces repulsion between the suspended droplets, driving them apart, whereas the horizontal electric field promotes their coalescence.</description>

      <title>Diffusive Braking of Penetrative Convection in Stably-Stratified Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixing at the interface between a convection zone and an adjacent, stably-stratified layer plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and evolution of stars and planets. In this work, we present a suite of 2D and 3D Boussinesq simulations that explore how bottom-driven convection penetrates into a compositionally stratified region. Our results reveal two distinct regimes: a penetrative regime, where the convection zone steadily grows by entraining fluid from above, and a stalled regime, where growth halts and transitions to overshooting convection. We extend classical entrainment theory by incorporating thermal and compositional diffusion and by deriving a modified entrainment law that predicts interface speeds in the weak-diffusion limit. We show that convection stalls when the interface speed becomes comparable to the compositional diffusion speed and validate the transition between behaviors across a wide parameter space of Richardson and Lewis numbers. Such diffusively-controlled stalling is unlikely to occur in stellar and planetary interiors, where the Lewis number is typically large and compositional diffusion is extremely slow. In these environments, compositional diffusion will merely slow the growth of the convection zone and convective boundaries are expected to stall only in the presence of other curtailing mechanisms such as strong radiative diffusion or rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic mode decomposition for detecting transient activity via sparsity and smoothness regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven modal decomposition technique that extracts coherent spatio-temporal structures from high-dimensional time-series data. By decomposing the dynamics into a set of modes, each associated with a single frequency and a growth rate, DMD enables a natural modal decomposition and dimensionality reduction of complex dynamical systems. However, when DMD is applied to transient dynamics, even if a large number of modes are used, it remains difficult to interpret how these modes contribute to the transient behavior. In this study, we propose a simple extension of DMD to overcome this limitation by introducing time-varying amplitudes for the DMD modes based on sparsity and smoothness regularization. This approach enables identification of dynamically significant modes and extraction of their transient activities, providing a more interpretable and faithful representation of non-steady dynamics. We apply the proposed method to fluid flow data exhibiting transient behavior and demonstrate that it can capture the temporal structure of mode activations that are not accessible with the standard DMD method.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Solver to Capture Unsteady Dynamics in the Aerospike Nozzle Wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust, high fidelity spectral solver for supersonic and hypersonic flow over an aerospike nozzle is presented. Numerical stability is achieved with a novel hybrid artificial viscosity (AV) - finite volume subcell element (FVSE) shock capturing method. The AV method is computational efficient. The diffusive FVSE method is locally called in elements where the AV method cannot sufficiently smooth the solution gradients, serving as a "parachute" in the context of numerical stability. The efficacy of this hybrid scheme is demonstrated on perfectly expanded Mach 2 and under expanded Mach 2 flow over a truncated aerospike and under expanded Mach 2 flow through a thruster module - aerospike nozzle assembly. The power spectral density of the unsteady pressure forcing on the nozzle is computed for each case and primary oscillation frequencies are identified. These oscillations are linked to flow patterns observed in Mach and schlieren images of the temporally evolving flow fields. To the authors' knowledge this is the first successful computation with a spectral solver of the unsteady, expanding, hypersonic flow over an aerospike from the initial thruster discharge until a quasi-steady state is achieved, as well as the first numerical investigation of the thruster module - aerospike nozzle assembly.</description>

      <title>Compressible boundary layers over isotropic porous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compressible laminar boundary layer developing over an isotropic porous substrate is investigated by asymptotic and numerical methods. The substrate is modeled as an array of cubes. The momentum and enthalpy balance equations are derived by volume averaging. The self-similar solution proposed by Tsiberkin (2018) [Transp. Porous Media 121(1):109-120] for streamwise-growing permeability is extended to include compressibility, heat conduction and a nonlinear drag. The velocity profile shows an inflection point at the free fluid-porous interfacial layer, below which it decreases to zero. A marked reduction of the adiabatic recovery temperature of the fluid and the velocity gradient at the interface is observed for high porosity, large grains and relatively high Mach numbers. The temperature imposed at the bottom of the porous substrate has a negligible influence on the shear stresses.</description>

      <title>Transition to the ultimate turbulent regime in stratified inclined duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stratified inclined duct (SID) flow provides a canonical model for sustained, buoyancy-driven exchange between two reservoirs of different density, and emerges as a new paradigm in geophysical fluid dynamics. Yet, the flow dynamics remain unclear in the highly turbulent regime; laboratory experiments can access this regime but they lack resolution, while direct numerical simulations (DNS) at realistically high Prandtl number Pr\,=\,7 (for heat in water) have not achieved sufficiently high Reynolds numbers $\reynolds$. We conduct three-dimensional DNS up to $\reynolds= 8000$ and observe the transition to the so-called ultimate regime of turbulent convection as evidenced by the Nusselt number scaling $\nusselt \sim \rayleigh^{1/2}$. We further report that the shear Reynolds number, a key parameter characterizing boundary layer (BL) dynamics, exceeds the threshold range of 420 for turbulent kinetic BLs with the emergence of logarithmic velocity profiles. Our work connects SID flow with the broader class of wall-bounded turbulent convection flows and gives insight into mixing in the vigorously turbulent regimes of oceanography and industry.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Stall Characteristics and Modelling of Time-Varying Pitching Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation examining how the complexity of pitching kinematics influences dynamic stall characteristics, including the stall delay and aerodynamic force response. The study examines whether the pitch rate defined at the static stall angle adequately characterises time-varying pitching kinematics for stall onset prediction. We then evaluate the performance of the generalised Goman-Khrabrov model in predicting force responses of nonlinear pitching motions and propose necessary modifications to extend the model's applicability to complex kinematics.</description>

      <title>Relative accuracy of turbulence simulations using pseudo-spectral and finite difference solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a single timestep, a spectral solver is known to be more accurate than its finite-difference counterpart. However, as we show in this paper, turbulence simulations using the two methods have nearly the same accuracy. In this paper, we simulate forced hydrodynamic turbulence on a uniform 256$^3$ grid for Reynolds numbers 965, 1231, 1515, and 1994. We show that the two methods yield nearly the same evolution for the total energy and the flow profiles. In addition, the steady-state energy spectrum, energy flux, and probability distribution functions of the velocity and its derivatives are very similar. We argue that within a turbulence attractor, the numerical errors are likely to get cancelled (rather than get added up), which leads to similar results for the finite-difference and spectral methods. These findings are very valuable, considering that a parallel finite-difference simulation is more versatile and efficient (for large grids) than its spectral counterpart.</description>

      <title>Behind the mirror: the hidden dissipative singular solutions of ideal reversible fluids on log-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical observations show that turbulence exhibits a broad range of scaling exponents, characterizing how the velocity gradients diverge in the inviscid limit. These exponents are thought to be linked to singular solutions of the Euler equations. In this work, we propose a dynamic approach to construct concept of these solutions directly from the fluid equations, using a reversible framework and introducing the efficiency $\cal{E}$, a non-dimensional number that quantifies the amount of energy stored within the flow due to an applied force. To circumvent the computational burden of tracking singularities at finer and finer scale, we test this approach on fluids on log-lattices, which allow for high effective resolutions at a moderate cost, while preserving the same symmetries and global conservation laws as ordinary fluids. We observe a phase transition at a given efficiency, separating regular, viscous solutions (hydrodynamic phase), from singular, inviscid solutions (singular phase). The singular solutions experience self-similar blow-ups with exponents corresponding to non-dissipative solutions. By applying a stochastic regularization, we are able to go past the blow-up, and show that the resulting solutions converge to power-law solutions with exponents characterizing dissipative solutions. Overall, the range of scaling exponents observed for log-lattice solutions is comparable to those of ordinary fluids.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer flow dynamics of propulsive flapping foils with increasing Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study flapping foils at optimally propulsive Strouhal number $St=0.3$ with increasing chord-based Reynolds number at $Re = 10^4$, $10^5$, and $10^6$ to examine changes in their unsteady boundary layers. Despite being prescribed the same freestream, the inner boundary layer characteristics exhibit different trends due to the generation of leading-edge vortices (LEVs) and their advection into the downstream flow. Propulsive flapping foils show an extended laminar region known as the relaminarization, during which the velocity profiles deviate from the standard log law. This relaminarization is accompanied by a significant decrease in the cyclic fluctuation of the wall friction coefficient and an increase in the shape factor while the freestream velocity increases under favourable pressure gradient conditions. This phenomenon intensifies with increasing $Re$. We found that higher $Re$ produces smaller LEVs in greater quantities, with a more rapid but stable breakdown, without resulting in a more chaotic turbulent downstream. This study strongly indicates that the relaminarization could extend beyond $Re=10^6$ as predicted by Fukagata[Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 2023]. The results support the potential for further exploration of flapping foils at high $Re$ for noise and drag reduction.</description>

      <title>LinguaFluid: Language Guided Fluid Control via Semantic Rewards in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of scientific machine learning, designing effective reward functions remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in environments where task goals are difficult to specify numerically. Reward functions in existing work are predominantly based on heuristics, manual engineering, or task-specific tuning. In this work, we introduce a semantically aligned reinforcement learning method where rewards are computed by aligning the current state with a target semantic instruction using a Sentence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (SBERT). Instead of relying on manually defined reward functions, the policy receives feedback based on the reward, which is a cosine similarity between the goal textual description and the statement description in the episode. We evaluated our approach in several environments and showed that semantic reward can guide learning to achieve competitive control behavior, even in the absence of hand-crafted reward functions. Our study demonstrates a correlation between the language embedding space and the conventional Euclidean space. This framework opens new horizons for aligning agent behavior with natural language goals and lays the groundwork for a more seamless integration of larger language models (LLMs) and fluid control applications.</description>
