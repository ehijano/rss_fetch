      <title>Analyzing Neural Network Information Flow Using Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a fresh view of the neural network (NN) data flow problem, i.e., identifying the NN connections that are most important for the performance of the full model, through the lens of graph theory. Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.</description>

      <title>ViSymRe: Vision Multimodal Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11139</link>

Abstract: Extracting interpretable equations from observational datasets to describe complex natural phenomena is one of the core goals of artificial intelligence. This field is known as symbolic regression (SR). In recent years, Transformer-based paradigms have become a new trend in SR, addressing the well-known problem of inefficient search. However, the modal heterogeneity between datasets and equations often hinders the convergence and generalization of these models. In this paper, we propose ViSymRe, a Vision Symbolic Regression framework, to explore the positive role of visual modality in enhancing the performance of Transformer-based SR paradigms. To overcome the challenge where the visual SR model is untrainable in high-dimensional scenarios, we present Multi-View Random Slicing (MVRS). By projecting multivariate equations into 2-D space using random affine transformations, MVRS avoids common defects in high-dimensional visualization, such as variable degradation, non-linear interaction missing, and exponentially increasing sampling complexity, enabling ViSymRe to be trained with low computational costs. To support dataset-only deployment of ViSymRe, we design a dual-vision pipeline architecture based on generative techniques, which reconstructs visual features directly from the datasets via an auxiliary Visual Decoder and automatically suppresses the attention weights of reconstruction noise through a proposed Biased Cross-Attention feature fusion module, ensuring that subsequent processes are not affected by noisy modalities. Ablation studies demonstrate the positive contribution of visual modality to improving model convergence level and enhancing various SR metrics. Furthermore, evaluation results on mainstream benchmarks indicate that ViSymRe achieves competitive performance compared to baselines, particularly in low-complexity and rapid-inference scenarios.</description>
