      <title>On the Entropy of a Random Geometric Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the entropy of a hard random geometric graph (RGG), a commonly used model for spatial networks, where the connectivity is governed by the distances between the nodes. Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \sim dm \log_2m$ for $0 &lt; r \leq 1/4$ in the case of $\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\log m$ for all $0&lt;r&lt;1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $\Omega((d-1)m \log_2m)$ for $0 &lt; r \leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Efficient LLR-Domain Decoding of ABS+ Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ABS+ polar codes are a generalization of Arikan polar codes that provides much faster polarization. We present an LLR-domain implementation of the SCL decoder of ABS+ polar codes. Furthermore, we optimize the SCL algorithm in order to reduce the complexity requirements for the LLRs computation. In comparison with classical polar codes, the proposed approach requires less number of arithmetic operations in the SCL decoder to obtain the fixed frame error rate (FER) at high-SNR region.</description>

      <title>A Differential Geometry and Algebraic Topology Based Public-Key Cryptographic Algorithm in Presence of Quantum Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In antiquity, the seal embodied trust, secrecy, and integrity in safeguarding the exchange of letters and messages. The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11]. The correctness and invertibility of the proposed algorithm are proven analytically. Furthermore, any adversarial attempt to recover the plaintext without the private key leads to an exponential growth of the adversarial search space,even under quantum speedups. The use of continuous geometric structures,non-linear operator compositions,and enforced blockwise serialization distinguishes this approach from existing quantum-safe cryptographic proposals based on primary discrete algebraic assumptions.</description>

      <title>A PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Channel-Induced Degradation in Edge Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the emerging paradigm of edge inference, neural networks (NNs) are partitioned across distributed edge devices that collaboratively perform inference via wireless transmission. However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics, without end-to-end re-training.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Quantum Semantic Communication via Sheaf Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SC) enables bandwidth-efficient coordination in multi-agent systems by transmitting meaning rather than raw bits. However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Encoding-Decoding Schemes for Lossless Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new lossless data compression coding scheme named an asymmetric encoding-decoding scheme (AEDS), which can be considered as a generalization of tANS (tabled variant of asymmetric numeral systems). In the AEDS, a data sequence $\bm{s}=s_1s_2\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \cdots, 2,1$, while $\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.</description>

      <title>PEMNet: Towards Autonomous and Enhanced Environment-Aware Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With 5G deployment and the evolution toward 6G, mobile networks must make decisions in highly dynamic environments under strict latency, energy, and spectrum constraints. Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.</description>

      <title>Sensing Mutual Information for Communication Signal with Deterministic Pilots and Random Data Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent emergence of the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework has sparked significant interest in quantifying the sensing capabilities inherent in communication signals. However, existing literature has mainly focused on scenarios involving either purely random or purely deterministic waveforms. This overlooks a critical reality: operational communication standards invariably utilize a hybrid structure comprising both deterministic pilots for channel estimation and random payloads for data transmission. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the sensing mutual information (SMI) and precoding design specifically for ISAC systems employing communication signals with both pilots and data payloads. First, by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we derive a tractable closed-form expression for the SMI that accurately accounts for the statistical properties of the hybrid signal. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we formulate a precoding optimization problem to maximize SMI with constraints on the transmit power and communication rate, which is solved via an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers framework. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed precoding design over conventional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Cell-Free Massive MIMO under Imperfect LoS Phase Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of imperfect line-of-sight (LoS) phase tracking on the performance of cell-free massive MIMO networks. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known or completely unknown phases, we consider a realistic regime where LoS phases are estimated with residual uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of the network performance, we apply these beamformers to the true uplink model and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature. Numerical results show that our framework bridges idealized assumptions and practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff for the Gray-Wyner Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Gray-Wyner lossy source coding problem and derive the first-order asymptotic optimal rate-distortion-perception region when additional perception constraints are imposed on reproduced source sequences. The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Rotation and IRS Beamforming for Multi-User Uplink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) enhances wireless coverage through directional gain steering, yet suffers from performance degradation under physical blockages. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) establishes reflective paths to bypass obstacles, but suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in the side-lobe region of base station (BS) antennas. To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An information-theoretic framework is introduced to analyze last-layer embedding, focusing on learned representations for regression tasks. We define representation-rate and derive limits on the reliability with which input-output information can be represented as is inherently determined by the input-source entropy. We further define representation capacity in a perturbed setting, and representation rate-distortion for a compressed output. We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.</description>

      <title>Polar Orbit Decoding: Universal Parallel Soft Decoding via Automorphism Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary linear block codes (BLBCs) form the foundation of modern communication systems, yet no single code family simultaneously optimizes all performance aspects. This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Autoencoders for Wideband Communications leveraging Walsh-Hadamard interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.</description>

Abstract: An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.</description>

      <title>Coding Schemes for the Noisy Torn Paper Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.</description>

      <title>Empirical Coordination over Markov Channel with Independent Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study joint source-channel coding over Markov channels through the empirical coordination framework. More specifically, we aim at determining the empirical distributions of source and channel symbols that can be induced by a coding scheme. We consider strictly causal encoders that generate channel inputs, without access to the past channel states, henceforth driving the current Markov state evolution. Our main result is the single-letter inner and outer bounds of the set of achievable joint distributions, coordinating all the symbols in the network. To establish the inner bound, we introduce a new notion of typicality, the input-driven Markov typicality, and develop its fundamental properties. Contrary to the classical block-Markov coding schemes that rely on blockwise independence for discrete memoryless channels, our analysis directly exploits the Markov channel structure and improves beyond the independence-based arguments.</description>

Abstract: Traditional data collection from sensors produce a lot of data, which lead to constant power consumption and require more storage space. This study proposes an algorithm for a data acquisition and processing method based on Fourier transform (DFT), which extracts dominant frequency components using harmonic analysis (HA) to identify frequency peaks. This algorithm allows sensors to activate only when an event occurs, while preserving critical information for detecting defects, such as those in the surface structures of buildings and ensuring accuracy for further predictions.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation in MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers (MiLACs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for future gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, enabling beamforming with greatly reduced hardware and computational cost. However, channel estimation for MiLAC-aided systems remains an open problem. Conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation rely on intensive digital computation, which undermines the benefits offered by MiLACs. In this letter, we propose efficient LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. By designing training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs, both LS and MMSE estimation are performed fully in the analog domain, achieving identical performance to their digital counterparts while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Numerical results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Exploring LLM Features in Predictive Process Monitoring for Small-Scale Event-Logs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.</description>

      <title>Dual-Scale Antenna Deployment for Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dual-scale deployment (DSD) framework is proposed for pinching antenna systems (PASS), under which four protocols are provided. 1) For the coarse-scale deployment, the pinching antenna (PA) is transferred over a large-scale range at the waveguide level. 2) For the fine-scale deployment, the PA is adjusted with high precision within a small-scale region. By simultaneously optimizing both scales, the proposed DSD framework can unleash the full potential of PA deployment, while maintaining low computational complexity. Based on this framework, we establish a practical power consumption model and derive theoretical energy efficiency expressions for PASS. Then, an energy-efficiency maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the transmit precoding, PA radiation power, and dual-scale PA deployment. To solve this non-convex, highly coupled problem, a low-complexity penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of theoretical results and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed DSD framework is highly effective for PASS, delivering about $70\%$ higher energy efficiency than the conventional cell-free architecture and nearly a \emph{twofold} improvement relative to MIMO systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel phase-shifting digital holography (PSDH) method leveraging a hybrid event-based vision sensor (EVS). The key idea of our method is the phase shift during a single exposure. The hybrid EVS records a hologram blurred by the phase shift, together with the events corresponding to blur variations. We present analytical and optimization-based methods that theoretically support the reconstruction of full-complex wavefronts from the blurred hologram and events. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a reconstruction quality comparable to that of a conventional PSDH method while enhancing the acquisition efficiency.</description>

      <title>Distribution Estimation with Side Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical problem of discrete distribution estimation using i.i.d. samples in a novel scenario where additional side information is available on the distribution. In large alphabet datasets such as text corpora, such side information arises naturally through word semantics/similarities that can be inferred by closeness of vector word embeddings, for instance. We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains.</description>

      <title>Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a unified interpretation of $\alpha$-mutual information ($\alpha$-MI) in terms of generalized $g$-leakage. Specifically, we present a novel interpretation of $\alpha$-MI within an extended framework for quantitative information flow based on adversarial generalized decision problems. This framework employs the Kolmogorov-Nagumo mean and the $q$-logarithm to characterize adversarial gain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, within this framework, the parameter $\alpha$ can be interpreted as a measure of the adversary's risk aversion.</description>

      <title>A Low-Complexity Architecture for Multi-access Coded Caching Systems with Arbitrary User-cache Access Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the periodic transmission masks for MASked Modulation (MASM) in half-duplex integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and derive their closed-form expected range-Doppler response $\mathbb{E}\{r(k,l,\nu)\}$. We show that range sidelobes ($k\neq l$) are Doppler-invariant, extending the range-sidelobe optimality to the 2-D setting. For the range mainlobe ($k=l$), periodic masking yields sparse Doppler sidelobes: Cyclic difference sets (CDSs) (in particular Singer CDSs) are minimax-optimal in a moderately dynamic regime, while in a highly dynamic regime the Doppler-sidelobe energy is a concave function of the mask autocorrelation, revealing an inevitable tradeoff with mainlobe fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Multiaccess Coded Caching with Heterogeneous Retrieval Costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiaccess coded caching (MACC) system, as formulated by Hachem {\it et al.}, consists of a central server with a library of $N$ files, connected to $K$ cache-less users via an error-free shared link, and $K$ cache nodes, each equipped with cache memory of size $M$ files. Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \textit{et al.} are layered. Then, a cost-aware optimization problem is derived that optimizes cache placement and minimizes system cost. By identifying a sparsity property of the optimal solution, we propose a structure-aware algorithm with reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme consistently outperforms the scheme of Cheng {\it et al.} in scenarios with heterogeneous retrieval costs.</description>

      <title>A Construction Framework of Coded Caching Scheme for Multi-Access MISO Systems via Knapsack Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the coded caching problem in a multi-access multiple-input single-output (MAMISO) network with the combinatorial topology. The considered system consists of a server containing $N$ files, $\Lambda$ cache nodes, and $K$ cache-less users, where each user can access a unique subset of $r$ cache nodes. The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity. To address this challenge, we formulate the design of multi-antenna placement delivery arrays (MAPDA) as a $0$--$1$ knapsack problem to maximize the achievable DoF, thereby transforming the complex combinatorial caching structure into a tractable optimization framework that yields efficient cache placement and flexible delivery strategies. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that: for networks with combinatorial topologies, the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum-DoF than existing schemes. Under identical cache size constraints, the subpacketization level remains comparable to existing linear subpacketization schemes. Moreover, under specific system conditions, the proposed scheme attains the theoretical maximum sum-DoF of $\min\{L+KM/N, K\}$ while achieving further reductions subpacketization. For particular combinatorial structures, we further derive optimized constructions that achieve even higher sum-DoF with lower subpacketization. ```</description>

      <title>Sparse Signal Recovery from Random Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the compressed sensing measurements of an unknown vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^n$ using random matrices, we present a simple method to determine $z$ without solving any optimization problem or linear system. Our method uses $\Theta(\log n)$ random sensing matrices in $\mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$ and runs in $O(kn\log n)$ time, where $k = \Theta(s\log n)$ and $s$ is the number of nonzero coordinates in $z$. We adapt our method to determine the support set of $z$ and experimentally compare with some optimization-based methods on binary signals.</description>

      <title>A New Decomposition Paradigm for Graph-structured Nonlinear Programs via Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite-sum nonlinear programs with localized variable coupling encoded by a (hyper)graph. We introduce a graph-compliant decomposition framework that brings message passing into continuous optimization in a rigorous, implementable, and provable way. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters (hypertree factor graphs). At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving local subproblems whose objective splits into an {\it intra}-cluster term summarized by cost-to-go messages from one min-sum sweep on the cluster tree, and an {\it inter}-cluster coupling term handled Jacobi-style using the latest out-of-cluster variables. To reduce computation/communication, the method supports graph-compliant surrogates that replace exact messages/local solves with compact low-dimensional parametrizations; in hypergraphs, the same principle enables surrogate hyperedge splitting, to tame heavy hyperedge overlaps while retaining finite-time intra-cluster message updates and efficient computation/communication. We establish convergence for (strongly) convex and nonconvex objectives, with topology- and partition-explicit rates that quantify curvature/coupling effects and guide clustering and scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.</description>
