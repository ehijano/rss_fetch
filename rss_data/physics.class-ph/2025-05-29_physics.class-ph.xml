      <title>Stress distribution in elastic disks with a hole under uniaxial compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stress and displacement distribution in a two-dimensional elastic hollow disk subjected to distributed diametric loading, extending our previous analysis of concentrated loading [Okamura et al. Strength Mater. 57, 102-114 (2025)]. The study provides deeper insights into the mechanical behavior of materials such as concrete and rock by examining the effects of load distribution on stress localization and displacement patterns. Using elastodynamic theory, we derive the static stress distributions and identify key differences from the concentrated loading case, particularly in the locations and magnitudes of stress extrema. This work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of stress behavior in elastic disks under realistic loading conditions.</description>

      <title>N-body linear force law allowing analytic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pair-wise force law in a system of N particles that produces analytic solutions for arbitrary number of particles, masses, and initial conditions. Each pair of particles interacts via a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and their separation distance, with the force directed radially. We show that, despite the N-body interaction, each particle behaves as if it interacts only with the center of mass of the system. This effective two-body interaction behaves as Hooke's Law with a common frequency for all particles, with the familiar analytic solutions for the trajectories. With these analytic solutions, it is possible to efficiently simulate a collection of these particles and incorporate other external forces. As an example, we simulate the particles within an adiabatically expanding container and calculate pressure and temperature in both the attractive and repulsive cases.</description>

      <title>Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric current generation and its dissipation are important physical processes. It ranges from the one follows the Ohm's law to superconductivity. Recently, it has been shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions, and we consider its importance for the electric current conduction in this work. We first show that it rectifies the odd explanation in Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire: Poynting's theorem explains that the energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that this energy is supplied by the chemical potential gradient generated by the battery connection. Next, we consider the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation did not include the capacitor contribution. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force might explain the Planckian dissipation observed in high transition temperature cuprate superconductors. The present work suggests the rethinking of the gauge invariance in Maxwell's equations.</description>
