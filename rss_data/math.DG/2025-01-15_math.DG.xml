      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities for hypersurfaces in the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Alexandrov Fenchel inequality, a far-reaching generalization of the classical isoperimetric inequality to arbitrary mixed volumes, is fundamental in convex geometry. In $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, it states: $\int_M\sigma_k d\mu_g \ge C(n,k)\big(\int_M\sigma_{k-1} d\mu_g\big)^{\frac{n-k}{n-k+1}}$. In \cite{Brendle-Guan-Li} (see also \cite{Guan-Li-2}), Brendle, Guan, and Li proposed a Conjecture on the corresponding inequalities in $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$, which implies a sharp relation between two adjacent quermassintegrals: $\mathcal{A}_k(\Omega)\ge \xi_{k,k-1}\big(\mathcal{A}_{k-1}(\Omega)\big)$, for any $ 1\le k\le n-1$. This is a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we prove a type of corresponding inequalities in $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}:$ $\int_{M}\sigma_kd\mu_g\ge \eta_k\big(\mathcal{A}_{k-1}(\Omega)\big)$ for any $0\le k\le n-1$. This is equivalent to the sharp relation among three adjacent quermassintegrals for hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$(see (\ref{ineq three})), which also implies a non-sharp relation between two adjacent quermassintegrals $\mathcal{A}_{k}(\Omega)\ge \eta_k\big(\mathcal{A}_{k-1}(\Omega)\big)$, for any $ 1\le k\le n-1$.</description>

      <title>3-symmetric spaces, Ricci solitons, and homogeneous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full classification of Riemannian $3$-symmetric spaces is presented. Up to Riemannian products the main building blocks consist in (possibly symmetric) spaces with semisimple isometry group, nilpotent Lie groups of step at most $2$ and spaces of type III and IV.
  For the most interesting family of examples, the Type III spaces, we produce an explicit description including results concerning the moduli space of all $3$-symmetric metrics living on a given Type III space. Each moduli space contains a unique distinguished point corresponding to an (almost-K\"ahler) expanding Ricci soliton metric. For certain classes of 3-symmetric metrics there are many different groups acting transitively and isometrically on a fixed Riemannian 3-symmetric space. The construction of expanding Ricci solitons on spaces of Type III is also shown to generalize to \emph{any} effective representation of a simple Lie group of non-compact type, yielding a very general construction of homogeneous Ricci solitons. We also give a procedure to compute the isometry group of any Ambrose--Singer space.</description>

      <title>Rigidity, volume and angle structures of 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedral 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the rigidity of hyperbolic polyhedral 3-manifolds and the volume optimization program of angle structures. We first study the rigidity of decorated 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedral metrics on 3-manifolds which are isometric gluing of decorated 1-3 type hyperbolic tetrahedra. Here a 1-3 type hyperbolic tetrahedron is a truncated hyperbolic tetrahedron with one hyperideal vertex and three ideal vertices. A decorated 1-3 type polyhedron is a 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedron with a horosphere centered at each ideal vertex. We show that a decorated 1-3 type hyperbolic polyhedral metric is determined up to isometry and change of decorations by its curvature. We also prove several results on the volume optimization program of Casson and Rivin, i,e. Casson-Rivin's volume optimization program is shown to be still valid for 1-3 type ideal triangulated 3-manifolds. We also get a strongly 1-efficiency triangulation when assuming the existence of an angle structure. On the whole, we follow the spirit of Luo-Yang's work in 2018 to prove our main results. The main differences come from that the hyperbolic tetrahedra considered here have completely different geometry with those considered in Luo-Yang's work in 2018.</description>

      <title>Polyakov-Alvarez Formula for Curvilinear Polygonal Domains with Slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $\zeta$-regularized determinant of the Friedrichs extension of the Dirichlet Laplace-Beltrami operator on curvilinear polygonal domains with corners of arbitrary positive angles. In particular, this includes slit domains. We obtain a short time asymptotic expansion of the heat trace using a classical patchwork method. This allows us to define the $\zeta$-regularized determinant of the Laplacian and prove a comparison formula of Polyakov-Alvarez type for a smooth and conformal change of metric.</description>

      <title>Large genus asymptotics of super Weil-Petersson volumes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the asymptotic expansions of super intersection numbers and prove that the associated coefficients are polynomials. Moreover, we give an algorithm which can explicitly compute these coefficients. As an application, we prove the existence of a complete asymptotic expansion of super Weil-Petersson volumes in the large genus. This generalizes the celebrated work of Mirzakhani-Zograf. We also confirm two conjectural formulae proposed by Griguolo-Papalini-Russo-Seminara.</description>

      <title>The one-dimensional equilibrium shape of a crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the free energy under a mass constraint may generate a convex crystal subject to assumptions on the potential $g(0)=0$, $g \ge 0$. The general problem classically attributed to Almgren is to infer if this is the case assuming the sub-level sets of g are convex. The theorem proven in the paper is that in one dimension the answer is positive.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of spacefilling branes in symplectic 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, a spacefilling brane structure is a closed 2-form $F$ which determines a complex structure, with respect to which $F +i\omega$ is holomorphic symplectic. For holomorphic symplectic compact K\"ahler 4-manifolds, we show that the moduli space of spacefilling branes is smooth, and determine its dimension. The proof relies on the local Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces and tori.</description>

      <title>Regularity and structure of non-planar $p$-elasticae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove regularity and structure results for $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with arbitrary $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n\geq2$. Planar $p$-elasticae are already classified and known to lose regularity. In this paper, we show that every non-planar $p$-elastica is analytic and three-dimensional, with the only exception of flat-core solutions of arbitrary dimensions.Subsequently, we classify pinned $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and, as an application, establish a Li--Yau type inequality for the $p$-bending energy of closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This extends previous works for $p=2$ and $n\geq2$ as well as for $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n=2$.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.02002v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the PSV construction, which provides a step by step method for obtaining tame translation surfaces with a suitable Veech group. In addition, we modify slightly this construction, and for each finitely generated subgroup $G&lt;{\rm GL}_{+}(2,\mathbb{R})$ without contracting elements, we produce a tame translation surface $S$ with infinite genus such that its Veech group is $G$. Furthermore, the ends space of $S$ can be written as $\mathcal{B}\sqcup \mathcal{U}$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is homeomorphic to the ends space of the group $G$, and $\mathcal{U}$ is a countable, discrete, dense, and open subset of the ends space of $S$.</description>

      <title>The Ooguri-Vafa Space as a Moduli Space of Framed Wild Harmonic Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ooguri-Vafa space is a 4-dimensional incomplete hyperk\"ahler manifold, defined on the total space of a singular torus fibration with one singular nodal fiber. It has been proposed that the Ooguri-Vafa hyperk\"ahler metric should be part of the local model of the hyperk\"ahler metric of the Hitchin moduli spaces, near the most generic kind of singular locus of the Hitchin fibration. In order to relate the Ooguri-Vafa space with the Hitchin moduli spaces, we show that the Ooguri-Vafa space can be interpreted as a set of rank 2, framed wild harmonic bundles over $\mathbb{C}P^1$, with one irregular singularity. Along the way we show that a certain twistor family of holomorphic Darboux coordinates, which describes the hyperk\"ahler geometry of the Ooguri-Vafa space, has an interpretation in terms of Stokes data associated to our framed wild harmonic bundles.</description>

Abstract: We obtain two-sided heat kernel estimates for Riemannian manifolds with ends with mixed boundary condition, provided that the heat kernels for the ends are well understood. These results extend previous results of Grigor'yan and Saloff-Coste by allowing for Dirichlet boundary condition. The proof requires the construction of a global harmonic function which is then used in the $h$-transform technique.</description>

      <title>Random Systems of Holomorphic Sections of a Sequence of Line bundles on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes an asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which, in terms of approximation theory, proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmically decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>
