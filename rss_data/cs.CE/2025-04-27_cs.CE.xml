      <title>SMARTFinRAG: Interactive Modularized Financial RAG Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial sectors are rapidly adopting language model technologies, yet evaluating specialized RAG systems in this domain remains challenging. This paper introduces SMARTFinRAG, addressing three critical gaps in financial RAG assessment: (1) a fully modular architecture where components can be dynamically interchanged during runtime; (2) a document-centric evaluation paradigm generating domain-specific QA pairs from newly ingested financial documents; and (3) an intuitive interface bridging research-implementation divides. Our evaluation quantifies both retrieval efficacy and response quality, revealing significant performance variations across configurations. The platform's open-source architecture supports transparent, reproducible research while addressing practical deployment challenges faced by financial institutions implementing RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Discovering Governing Equations of Geomagnetic Storm Dynamics with Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms are large-scale disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere driven by solar wind interactions, posing significant risks to space-based and ground-based infrastructure. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index quantifies geomagnetic storm intensity by measuring global magnetic field variations. This study applies symbolic regression to derive data-driven equations describing the temporal evolution of the Dst index. We use historical data from the NASA OMNIweb database, including solar wind density, bulk velocity, convective electric field, dynamic pressure, and magnetic pressure. The PySR framework, an evolutionary algorithm-based symbolic regression library, is used to identify mathematical expressions linking dDst/dt to key solar wind. The resulting models include a hierarchy of complexity levels and enable a comparison with well-established empirical models such as the Burton-McPherron-Russell and O'Brien-McPherron models. The best-performing symbolic regression models demonstrate superior accuracy in most cases, particularly during moderate geomagnetic storms, while maintaining physical interpretability. Performance evaluation on historical storm events includes the 2003 Halloween Storm, the 2015 St. Patrick's Day Storm, and a 2017 moderate storm. The results provide interpretable, closed-form expressions that capture nonlinear dependencies and thresholding effects in Dst evolution.</description>

      <title>EAQGA: A Quantum-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm with Novel Entanglement-Aware Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic algorithms are highly effective optimization techniques for many computationally challenging problems, including combinatorial optimization tasks like portfolio optimization. Quantum computing has also shown potential in addressing these complex challenges. Combining these approaches, quantum genetic algorithms leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to enhance the performance of classical genetic algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel quantum genetic algorithm introducing an innovative crossover strategy to generate quantum circuits from a binary solution. We incorporate a heuristic method to encode entanglement patterns from parent solutions into circuits for the next generation. Our algorithm advances quantum genetic algorithms by utilizing a limited number of entanglements, enabling efficient exploration of optimal solutions without significantly increasing circuit depth, making it suitable for near-term applications. We test this approach on a portfolio optimization problem using an IBM 127 qubits Eagle processor (ibm_quebec) and simulators. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, our results show that the proposed method improves fitness values by 33.6% over classical genetic algorithm and 37.2% over quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, using the same iteration counts and population sizes with real quantum hardware employing 100 qubits. These findings highlight the potential of current quantum computers to address real-world utility-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach For Bitcoin Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that is gaining more popularity in recent years. Previous studies have shown that closing price alone is not enough to forecast stock market series. We introduce a new set of time series and demonstrate that a subset is necessary to improve directional accuracy based on a machine learning ensemble. In our experiments, we study which time series and machine learning algorithms deliver the best results. We found that the most relevant time series that contribute to improving directional accuracy are Open, High and Low, with the largest contribution of Low in combination with an ensemble of Gated Recurrent Unit network and a baseline forecast. The relevance of other Bitcoin-related features that are not price-related is negligible. The proposed method delivers similar performance to the state-of-the-art when observing directional accuracy.</description>

      <title>Rapid modelling of reactive transport in porous media using machine learning: limitations and solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reactive transport in porous media plays a pivotal role in subsurface reservoir processes, influencing fluid properties and geochemical characteristics. However, coupling fluid flow and transport with geochemical reactions is computationally intensive, requiring geochemical calculations at each grid cell and each time step within a discretized simulation domain. Although recent advancements have integrated machine learning techniques as surrogates for geochemical simulations, ensuring computational efficiency and accuracy remains a challenge. This work investigates machine learning models as replacements for a geochemical module in a simulation of reactive transport in porous media. As a proof of concept, we test this approach on a well-documented cation exchange problem. While the surrogate models excel in isolated predictions, they fall short in rollout predictions over successive time steps. By introducing modifications, including physics-based constraints and tailored dataset generation strategies, we show that machine learning surrogates can achieve accurate rollout predictions. Our findings emphasize that even for a simple sorption equilibrium reaction (cation exchange problem), machine learning surrogates alone fail in predicting over successive time-steps. Incorporating simple physics-based modifications enables us to overcome this limitation. A detailed analysis of the limitations and potential mitigation strategies is presented in this work.</description>

      <title>Function-coherent gambles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces function-coherent gambles, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Equi-Euler GraphNet: An Equivariant, Temporal-Dynamics Informed Graph Neural Network for Dual Force and Trajectory Prediction in Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</description>
