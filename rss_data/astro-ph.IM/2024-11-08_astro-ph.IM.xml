      <title>MAUVE: An Ultraviolet Astrophysics Probe Mission Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the mission concept "Mission to Analyze the UltraViolet universE" (MAUVE), a wide-field spectrometer and imager conceived during the inaugural NASA Astrophysics Mission Design School. MAUVE responds to the 2023 Announcement of Opportunity for Probe-class missions, with a budget cap of \$1 billion, and would hypothetically launch in 2031. However, the formulation of MAUVE was an educational exercise and the mission is not being developed further. The Principal Investigator-led science of MAUVE aligns with the priorities outlined in the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey, enabling new characterizations of exoplanet atmospheres, the early-time light curves of some of the universe's most explosive transients, and the poorly-understood extragalactic background light. Because the Principal Investigator science occupies 30% of the observing time available during the mission's 5 yr lifespan, we provide an observing plan that would allow for 70% of the observing time to be used for General Observer programs, with community-solicited proposals. The onboard detector (THISTLE) claims significant heritage from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on Hubble, but extends its wavelength range down to the extreme UV. We note that MAUVE would be the first satellite in decades with the ability to access this regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. MAUVE has a field of view of 900" x 900"  a photometric sensitivity extending to $m_{UV}\leq 24$, and a resolving power of $R\sim1000$. This paper provides full science and mission traceability matrices for this concept, and also outlines cost and scheduling timelines aimed at enabling a within-budget mission and an on-time launch.</description>

      <title>Astronomaly Protege: Discovery Through Human-Machine Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern telescopes generate catalogs of millions of objects with the potential for new scientific discoveries, but this is beyond what can be examined visually. Here we introduce Astronomaly: Protege, an extension of the general purpose machine learning-based active anomaly detection framework Astronomaly. Protege is designed to provide well-selected recommendations for visual inspection, based on a small amount of optimized human labeling. The resulting sample contains rare or unusual sources which are simultaneously as diverse as the human trainer chooses, and of scientific interest to them. We train Protege on images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, leveraging the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to find a low-dimensional representation of the radio galaxy cutouts. By operating in this feature space, Protege is able to recommend interesting sources with completely different morphologies in image space to those it has been trained on. This provides important advantages over similarity searches, which can only find more examples of known sources, or blind anomaly detection, which selects unusual, but not necessarily scientifically interesting sources. Using an evaluation subset, we show that, with minimal training, Protege provides excellent recommendations and find that it is even able to recommend sources that the authors missed. We briefly highlight some of Protege's top recommendations, which include X- and circular-shaped sources, filamentary structures and one-sided structures. These results illustrate the power of an optimized human-machine collaboration such as Protege to make unexpected discoveries in samples beyond human-accessible scales.</description>

      <title>Investigating mutual coupling in the MWA Phase II compact array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of the power spectrum of high redshift 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen probes the formation of the first luminous objects and the ionization of intergalactic medium by the first stars. However, the 21 cm signal at these redshifts is orders of magnitude fainter than astrophysical foregrounds, making it challenging to measure. Power spectrum techniques may be able to avoid these foregrounds by extracting foreground-free Fourier modes, but this is exacerbated by instrumental systematics that can add spectral structure to the data, leaking foreground power to the foreground-free Fourier modes. It is therefore imperative that any instrumental systematic effects are properly understood and mitigated. One such systematic occurs when neighboring antennas have undesired coupling. A systematic in Phase II data from the MWA was identified which manifests as excess correlation in the visibilities. One possible explanation for such an effect is mutual coupling between antennas. We have built a numerical electromagnetic software simulation of the antenna beam using FEKO to estimate the amplitude of this effect for multiple antennas in the MWA. We also calculate coupling predicted by the re-radiation model which is found to be somewhat lower than the coupling coefficients produced by the simulation. We find that with many approximations both types of mutual coupling predictions are somewhat lower than the minimum necessary to detect the brightest 21 cm models. However more work is necessary to better validate the required level of coupling and to verify that approximations did not under estimate the level of coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Contamination From Nearby Stellar Companions in Gaia DR3 Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying and removing binary stars from stellar samples is a crucial but complicated task. Regardless of how carefully a sample is selected, some binaries will remain and complicate interpretation of results, especially via flux contamination of survey photometry. One such sample is the data from the Gaia spacecraft, which is collecting photometry and astrometry of more than $10^{9}$ stars. To quantify the impact of binaries on Gaia photometry, we assembled a sample of known binary stars observed with adaptive optics and with accurately measured parameters, which we used to predict Gaia photometry for each stellar component. We compared the predicted photometry to the actual Gaia photometry for each system, and found that the contamination of Gaia photometry because of multiplicity decreases non-linearly from near-complete contamination ($\rho \leq 0''.15$) to no contamination (binary projected separation, or $\rho &gt; 0''.3$). We provide an analytic relation to analytically correct photometric bias in a sample of Gaia stars using the binary separation. This correction is necessary because the Gaia PSF photometry extraction does not fully remove the secondary star flux for binaries with separations with $\rho \lesssim 0''.3$. We also evaluated the utility of various Gaia quality-of-fit metrics for identifying binary stars and found that RUWE remains the best indicator for unresolved binaries, but multi-peak image fraction probes a separation regime not currently accessible to RUWE.</description>

      <title>SpectraFM: Tuning into Stellar Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models in astrophysics are often limited in scope and cannot adapt to data from new instruments or tasks. We introduce SpectraFM, a Transformer-based foundation model architecture that can be pre-trained on stellar spectra from any wavelength range and instrument. SpectraFM excels in generalization by combining flexibility with knowledge transfer from pre-training, allowing it to outperform traditional machine learning methods, especially in scenarios with limited training data. Our model is pre-trained on approximately 90k examples of synthetic spectra to predict the chemical abundances (Fe, Mg, O), temperature, and specific gravity of stars. We then fine-tune the model on real spectra to adapt it to observational data before fine-tuning it further on a restricted 100-star training set in a different wavelength range to predict iron abundance. Despite a small iron-rich training set of real spectra, transfer learning from the synthetic spectra pre-training enables the model to perform well on iron-poor stars. In contrast, a neural network trained from scratch fails at this task. We investigate the Transformer attention mechanism and find that the wavelengths receiving attention carry physical information about chemical composition. By leveraging the knowledge from pre-training and its ability to handle non-spectra inputs, SpectraFM reduces the need for large training datasets and enables cross-instrument and cross-domain research. Its adaptability makes it well-suited for tackling emerging challenges in astrophysics, like extracting insights from multi-modal datasets.</description>

      <title>Rubin ToO 2024: Envisioning the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST Target of Opportunity program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory is planned to begin in the Fall of 2025. The LSST survey cadence has been designed via a community-driven process regulated by the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee (SCOC), which recommended up to 3% of the observing time to carry out Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. Experts from the scientific community, Rubin Observatory personnel, and members of the SCOC were brought together to deliver a recommendation for the implementation of the ToO program during a workshop held in March 2024. Four main science cases were identified: gravitational wave multi-messenger astronomy, high energy neutrinos, Galactic supernovae, and small potentially hazardous asteroids possible impactors. Additional science cases were identified and briefly addressed in the documents, including lensed or poorly localized gamma-ray bursts and twilight discoveries. Trigger prioritization, automated response, and detailed strategies were discussed for each science case. This document represents the outcome of the Rubin ToO 2024 workshop, with additional contributions from members of the Rubin Science Collaborations. The implementation of the selection criteria and strategies presented in this document has been endorsed in the SCOC Phase 3 Recommendations document (PSTN-056). Although the ToO program is still to be finalized, this document serves as a baseline plan for ToO observations with the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first bounds on GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, showing that these bounds surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>

      <title>The OASES Project: Exploring the Outer Solar System through Stellar Occultation with Amateur-Class Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of kilometre-sized trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) is one of the ultimate goals in the search for the origin and evolution of the Solar System. However, such exploration is challenging because these small bodies are too faint to be directly detected. One potential avenue for detecting and investigating small and faint TNOs is the monitoring of stellar occultation events. This paper reviews the concept and methodology of monitoring observations of stellar occultations by small, unidentified TNOs, focusing on our observational programme, Organized Autotelescopes for Serendipitous Event Survey (OASES). OASES aims to detect and investigate stellar occultations by unidentified TNOs using multiple amateur-sized telescopes equipped with commercial Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. Through the monitoring observations conducted so far, OASES has found one possible occultation event by a kilometre-sized TNO. The paper also discusses future developments of the OASES project and deliberates on the potential of movie observations in expanding the frontiers of outer Solar System research.

      <title>A Compact, Coherent Representation of Stellar Surface Variation in the Spectral Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying inhomogeneities on stellar surfaces constitute one of the largest sources of radial velocity (RV) error for planet detection and characterization. We show that stellar variations, because they manifest on coherent, rotating surfaces, give rise to changes that are complex but useably compact and coherent in the spectral domain. Methods for disentangling stellar signals in RV measurements benefit from modeling the full domain of spectral pixels. We simulate spectra of spotted stars using starry and construct a simple spectrum projection space that is sensitive to the orientation and size of stellar surface features. Regressing measured RVs in this projection space reduces RV scatter by 60-80% while preserving planet shifts. We note that stellar surface variability signals do not manifest in spectral changes that are purely orthogonal to a Doppler shift or exclusively asymmetric in line profiles; enforcing orthogonality or focusing exclusively on asymmetric features will not make use of all the information present in the spectra. We conclude with a discussion of existing and possible implementations on real data based on the presented compact, coherent framework for stellar signal mitigation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Consistency and Characterizing the Confidence of Coronal Holes Detected by Active Contours without Edges (ACWE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coronal Holes (CHs) are regions of open magnetic field lines, resulting in high speed solar wind. Accurate detection of CHs is vital for space weather prediction. This paper presents an intramethod ensemble for coronal hole detection based on the Active Contours Without Edges (ACWE) segmentation algorithm. The purpose of this ensemble is to develop a confidence map that defines, for all on disk regions of a Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) image, the likelihood that each region belongs to a CH based on that region's proximity to, and homogeneity with, the core of identified CH regions. By relying on region homogeneity, and not intensity (which can vary due to various factors including line of sight changes and stray light from nearby bright regions), to define the final confidence of any given region, this ensemble is able to provide robust, consistent delineations of the CH regions. Using the metrics of global consistency error (GCE), local consistency error (LCE), intersection over union (IOU), and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), the method is shown to be robust to different spatial resolutions maintaining a median IOU $&gt;0.75$ and minimum SSIM $&gt;0.93$ even when the segmentation process was performed on an EUV image decimated from $4096\times4096$ pixels down to $512\times512$ pixels. Furthermore, using the same metrics, the method is shown to be robust across short timescales, producing segmentation with a mean IOU of 0.826 from EUV images taken at a 1 hour cadence, and showing a smooth decay in similarity across all metrics as a function of time, indicating self-consistent segmentations even when corrections for exposure time have not been applied to the data. Finally, the accuracy of the segmentations and confidence maps are validated by considering the skewness (i.e., unipolarity) of the underlying magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously search for multi-target Galactic binary gravitational waves in reduced parameter space with LMPSO-CV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Galactic binary gravitational waves is a critical challenge for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. We propose an innovative approach to simultaneously explore gravitational waves originating from Galactic binaries by developing a new Local Maxima Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO) algorithm. Our method identifies local maxima in the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic and applies astrophysical models and the properties of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic within parameter space to uncover Galactic binary gravitational wave signals in the dataset. This new approach effectively addresses the inaccuracies often associated with signal subtraction contamination, a challenge for traditional iterative subtraction methods, particularly when dealing with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals (e.g., SNR $&lt;$ 15). We also account for the effects of overlapping signals and degeneracy noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we use residuals from the LISA mock data challenge (LDC1-4), where 10,982 injected sources with SNR $\ge$ 15 have been removed. For the remaining low-SNR sources (SNR $&lt;$ 15), our method efficiently identifies 6,508 signals, achieving a 63.2\% detection rate.</description>

      <title>Merging L-shaped resonator with Michelson configuration for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves in kilohertz frequency range is crucial for understanding the physical processes of binary neutron star mergers. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021019 (2023)], a new interferometric configuration has been proposed, employing an L-shaped optical resonant cavity as arm cavity. This alteration enhances the detector's response to kHz signals. However, the departure from conventional Michelson configuration necessitates a redesign of its sensing and control scheme, which is currently under study. In this article, we propose replacing linear arm cavities in the conventional Michelson by the L-shaped resonator. This hybrid configuration features an enhanced response at kHz while retaining the same sensing and control scheme as the Michelson setup. At the conceptual level, it exhibits higher sensitivity in the 2-4 kHz range compared to existing configurations.</description>
