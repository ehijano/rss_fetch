      <title>Cell Escape Probabilities for Markov Processes on a Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic equations describe physical processes in a high-dimensional phase space and are often simulated using Markov process-based Monte Carlo routines. The quantities of interest are typically defined on the lower-dimensional position space and estimated on a grid (histogram). In several applications, such as the construction of diffusion Monte Carlo-like techniques and variance prediction for particle tracing Monte Carlo methods, the cell escape probabilities, i.e., the probabilities with which particles escape a grid cell during one step of the Markov process, are of interest. In this paper, we derive formulas to calculate the cell escape probabilities for common mesh elements in one, two, and three dimensions. Deterministic calculation of cell escape probabilities in higher dimensions becomes expensive and prone to quadrature errors due to the involved high-dimensional integrals. We therefore also introduce a stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate the escape probabilities, which is more robust at the cost of a statistical error. The code used to perform the numerical experiments and accompanying GeoGebra tutorials are openly available at https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/numa/public/escape-probabilities-markov-processes.</description>

      <title>On Faddeev's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faddeev' equations are a set-theoretical and an operator forms of the star-triangle equation. Known solutions of the quantum star-triangle equation, related to the Faddeev equations, are based on various forms of the modular double of the Weyl algebra including its cyclic representation. We show in this paper that Fadeev's equation also leads to a solution of the quantum star-triangle equation even in the case of a simple Weyl algebra with $|q|&lt;1$. This paper can be seen as an addendum to the recent paper "V. Bazhanov and S. Sergeev, A distant descendant of the six-vertex model, arXiv:2310.08427".</description>

      <title>Functional Bethe Ansatz for a $\sinh$-Gordon model with real $q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Bazhanov and Sergeev have described an Ising-type integrable model which can be identified as a $\sinh$-Gordon-type model with an infinite number of states but with a real parameter $q$. This model is the subject of Sklyanin's Functional Bethe Ansatz. We develop in this paper the whole technique of the FBA which includes:
  1. Construction of eigenstates of an off-diagonal element of a monodromy matrix. Most important ingredients of these eigenstates are the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients of the corresponding representation.
  2. Separately, we discuss the Clebsh-Gordan coefficients, as well as the Wigner's 6j symbols, in details. The later are rather well known in the theory of $3D$ indices.
  Thus, the Sklyanin basis of the quantum separation of variables is constructed. The matrix elements of an eigenstate of the auxiliary transfer matrix in this basis are products of functions satisfying the Baxter equation. Such functions are called usually the $Q$-operators. We investigate the Baxter equation and $Q$-operators from two points of view.
  3. In the model considered the most convenient Bethe-type variables are the zeros of a Wronskian of two well defined particular solutions of the Baxter equation. This approach works perfectly in the thermodynamic limit. We calculate the distribution of these roots in the thermodynamic limit, and so we reproduce in this way the partition function of the model.
  4. The real parameter $q$, which is the standard quantum group parameter, plays the role of the absolute temperature in the model considered. Expansion with respect to $q$ (tropical expansion) gives an alternative way to establish the structure of the eigenstates. In this way we classify the elementary excitations over the ground state.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear ensemble filtering with diffusion models: Application to the surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection between classical data assimilation methods and novel machine learning techniques has attracted significant interest in recent years. Here we explore another promising solution in which diffusion models are used to formulate a robust nonlinear ensemble filter for sequential data assimilation. Unlike standard machine learning methods, the proposed \textit{Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF)} is completely training-free and can efficiently generate a set of analysis ensemble members. In this study, we apply the EnSF to a surface quasi-geostrophic model and compare its performance against the popular Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), which makes Gaussian assumptions on the posterior distribution. Numerical tests demonstrate that EnSF maintains stable performance in the absence of localization and for a variety of experimental settings. We find that EnSF achieves competitive performance relative to LETKF in the case of linear observations, but leads to significant advantages when the state is nonlinearly observed and the numerical model is subject to unexpected shocks. A spectral decomposition of the analysis results shows that the largest improvements over LETKF occur at large scales (small wavenumbers) where LETKF lacks sufficient ensemble spread. Overall, this initial application of EnSF to a geophysical model of intermediate complexity is very encouraging, and motivates further developments of the algorithm for more realistic problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, using the split Casimir generators we have found the decomposition of the antisymmetric part of $\mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 5}$. This decomposition contains the representations that appeared in the decomposition of $\mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 4}$ and only one new representation $X_5$. The dimension of this representation has been proposed in [A.J.Macfarlane, H.Pfeiffer, J.Phys.A: Math. Gen. 36 (2003) 2305]. Our decomposition is valid for all Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>The spectral continuum in the Rabi-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rabi-Stark model is a non-linear generalization of the quantum Rabi model including the dynamical Stark shift as a tunable term, which can be realized via quantum simulation on a cavity QED platform. When the Stark coupling becomes equal to the mode frequency, the spectrum changes drastically, a transition usually termed "spectral collapse" because numerical studies indicate an infinitely degenerate ground state. We show that the spectrum extends continuously from a threshold value up to infinity. A set of normalizable states are embedded in the continuum which furnishes an unexpected analogy to the atomic Stark effect. Bound states and continuum can be obtained analytically through two equally justified, but different confluence processes of the associated differential equation in Bargmann space. Moreover, these results are obtained independently using a method based on adiabatic elimination of the spin degree of freedom and corroborated through large-scale numerical checks.</description>

      <title>Polyadic sigma matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize $\sigma$-matrices to higher arities using the polyadization procedure proposed by the author. We build the nonderived $n$-ary version of $SU\left( 2\right) $ using cyclic shift block matrices. We define a new function, the polyadic trace, which has an additivity property analogous to the ordinary trace for block diagonal matrices and which can be used to build the corresponding invariants. The elementary $\Sigma$-matrices introduced here play a role similar to ordinary matrix units, and their sums are full $\Sigma$-matrices which can be treated as a polyadic analog of $\sigma$-matrices. The presentation of $n$-ary $SU\left( 2\right) $ in terms of full $\Sigma$-matrices is done using the Hadamard product. We then generalize the Pauli group in two ways: for the binary case we introduce the extended phase shifted $\sigma$-matrices with multipliers in cyclic groups of order $4q$ ($q&gt;4$), and for the polyadic case we construct the correspondent finite $n$-ary semigroup of phase-shifted elementary $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q\left( n-1\right) +1$, and the finite $n$-ary group of phase-shifted full $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q$. Finally, we introduce the finite $n$-ary group of heterogeneous full $\mathit{\Sigma}^{het}$-matrices of order $\left( 4q\left( n-1\right) \right) ^{4}$. Some examples of the lowest arities are presented.</description>

      <title>BEACON: Bayesian Experimental design Acceleration with Conditional Normalizing flows $-$ a case study in optimal monitor well placement for CO$_2$ sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CO$_2$ sequestration is a crucial engineering solution for mitigating climate change. However, the uncertain nature of reservoir properties, necessitates rigorous monitoring of CO$_2$ plumes to prevent risks such as leakage, induced seismicity, or breaching licensed boundaries. To address this, project managers use borehole wells for direct CO$_2$ and pressure monitoring at specific locations. Given the high costs associated with drilling, it is crucial to strategically place a limited number of wells to ensure maximally effective monitoring within budgetary constraints. Our approach for selecting well locations integrates fluid-flow solvers for forecasting plume trajectories with generative neural networks for plume inference uncertainty. Our methodology is extensible to three-dimensional domains and is developed within a Bayesian framework for optimal experimental design, ensuring scalability and mathematical optimality. We use a realistic case study to verify these claims by demonstrating our method's application in a large scale domain and optimal performance as compared to baseline well placement.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations for Fractional Differential Equations of Higher Order and a Wright-Type Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new relationship is established between the solutions of higher fractional differential equations and a Wright-type transformation. Solutions could be interpreted as expected values of functions in a random time process. As applications, we solve the fractional beam equation, fractional electric circuits with special functions as external sources, and derive dAlemberts formula for the fractional wave equation. Due to this relationship, we present two methods for simulating solutions of fractional differential equations. The two approaches use the interpretation of the Caputo derivative of a function as a Wright-type transformation of the higher derivative of the function. In the first approach, we use the Runge-Kutta method of hybrid orders 4 and 5 to solve ordinary differential equations combined with the Monte Carlo integration to conduct the Wrighttype transformation. The second method uses a feedforward neural network to simulate the fractional differential equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jacobi sigma models are two-dimensional topological non-linear field theories which are associated with Jacobi structures. The latter can be considered as a generalization of Poisson structures. After reviewing the main properties and peculiarities of these models, we focus on the twisted version in which a Wess-Zumino term is included. This modification allows for the target space to be a twisted Jacobi manifold. We discuss in particular the model on the sphere $S^5$.</description>

Abstract: We prove sharp universal upper bounds on the number of steady and asymptotic states of discrete- and continuous-time Markovian evolutions of open quantum systems. We show that the bounds depend only on the dimension of the system and not on the details of the dynamics.

      <description>arXiv:2404.00587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase-field system is a nonlinear model that has significant applications in material sciences. In this paper, we are concerned with the uniqueness of determining the nonlinear energy potential in a phase-field system consisted of Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations. This system finds widespread applications in the development of alloys engineered to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. The goal is to reconstruct the nonlinear energy potential through the measurements of concentration fields. We establish the local well-posedness of the phase-field system based on the implicit function theorem in Banach spaces. Both of the uniqueness results for recovering time-independent and time-dependent energy potential functions are provided through the higher order linearization technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a bijection between admissible representations for an affine Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ at boundary admissible levels and $\mathbb{C}^\times$ fixed points in homogeneous elliptic affine Springer fibres for the Langlands dual affine Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Using this bijection, we relate the modularity of the characters of admissible representations to Cherednik's Verlinde algebra construction coming from double affine Hecke algebras. Finally, we show that the expected behaviors of simple modules under quantized Drinfeld-Sokolov reductions are compatible with the reductions from affine Springer fibres to affine Spaltenstein varieties. This yields (modulo some conjectures) a similar bijection for irreducible representations of $\mathcal{W}$-algebras, as well as an interpretation for their modularity properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to read off the quantum gravity dual of a CFT directly from its operator algebra? In this essay, we present a step-by-step recipe synthesizing results and techniques from conformal bootstrap, topological symmetries, tensor networks, a novel symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization algorithm devised originally in lattice models, and the asymptotics of quantum $6j$ symbols, thereby providing an answer in the affirmative. Quantum 2D Liouville theory serves as a simple and explicit example, illustrating how the quantum gravitational path integral can be built up from local pieces of BCFT correlation functions, which we call the ``BCFT Legos''. The constructive map between gravity and CFT naturally and explicitly bridges local geometrical data, algebraic structures, and quantum entanglement, as envisaged by the $\it{It \, from \, Qubit}$ motto.</description>

Then for every $x \in ( \mathcal{D}(\theta_f) \cap\mathcal{D}(\theta_g))\setminus\{0\}$, we show that \begin{align}\label{UB} (1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \|\theta_f x\|_0\|\theta_g x\|_0 \geq \frac{1}{\left(\displaystyle\sup_{n,m \in \mathbb{N} }|f_n(\omega_m)|\right)^p\left(\displaystyle\sup_{n, m \in \mathbb{N}}|g_m(\tau_n)|\right)^p}, \end{align} where \begin{align*} &amp; \theta_f: \mathcal{D}(\theta_f) \ni x \mapsto \theta_fx := \{f_n(x)\}_{n=1}^\infty\in \ell^p(\mathbb{N}), \quad \theta_g: \mathcal{D}(\theta_g) \ni x \mapsto \theta_gx := \{g_n(x)\}_{n=1}^\infty\in \ell^p(\mathbb{N}). \end{align*} Inequality (1) is unexpectedly different from both bounded uncertainty principle \textit{[arXiv:2308.00312v1]} and unbounded uncertainty principle \textit{[arXiv:2312.00366v1]} for Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal; and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; but has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr Hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A time-like membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon which is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the Membrane Paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Oscillating flow around a circular cylindrical post confined between two parallel plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the interest in determining the effect of the micro-anatomy of the spinal subarachnoid space on the cerebrospinal fluid flow and on the associated transport of solutes. To that aim, we focus on a canonical model problem in which a circular post of radius $a$, confined between two parallel plates separated by a distance $2h$, is subjected to an oscillatory flow. In particular, we are concerned with the steady, viscous, time-averaged flow that persists in the vicinity on the cylinder, when the stroke length of the oscillating flow, $U_{\infty}/\omega$ is smaller or comparable to the radius of the post, $a$, where $U_{\infty}$ and $\omega$ are the mean velocity amplitude and the corresponding angular frequency, respectively. First, we analyze the asymptotic limit of small values of the stroke length varying the aspect ratio of the post $\lambda$ and the Womersley number $M$. First-order steady-streaming corrections at leading order have been computed, together with associated Stokes-drift component, the sum of both yielding the mean Lagrangian velocity field. The confinement effect is seen to induce the three-dimensionality of flow. Moreover, in the mid plane the time-averaged steady flow exhibits a recirculating vortex attached to the wall of the post that decreases as $M$ increases for low values of $M$. However, for values of $M$ larger than a critical one, $M_{cr}(\lambda)$, a second, outer vortex is also formed. The dependence $M_{cr}(\lambda)$ has been quantified. The analysis has been corroborated experimentally for a fixed aspect ratio. Consideration of an anharmonic oscillating flow shows the fort-and-aft symmetry of the steady flow is broken. Finally, the analysis is experimentally extended to consider an array of equally spaced posts.</description>

      <title>MICROSIM: A high performance phase-field solver based on CPU and GPU implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase-field method has become a useful tool for the simulation of classical metallurgical phase transformations as well as other phenomena related to materials science. The thermodynamic consistency that forms the basis of these formulations lends to its strong predictive capabilities and utility. However, a strong impediment to the usage of the method for typical applied problems of industrial and academic relevance is the significant overhead with regard to the code development and know-how required for quantitative model formulations. In this paper, we report the development of an open-source phase-field software stack that contains generic formulations for the simulation of multi-phase and multi-component phase transformations. The solvers incorporate thermodynamic coupling that allows the realization of simulations with real alloys in scenarios directly relevant to the materials industry. Further, the solvers utilize parallelization strategies using either multiple CPUs or GPUs to provide cross-platform portability and usability on available supercomputing machines. Finally, the solver stack also contains a graphical user interface to gradually introduce the usage of the software. The user interface also provides a collection of post-processing tools that allow the estimation of useful metrics related to microstructural evolution.</description>

      <title>Dual-Unitary Classical Shadow Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator spreading in random dual-unitary circuits within the context of classical shadow tomography. Primarily, we analyze the dynamics of the Pauli weight in one-dimensional qubit systems evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits has a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$, and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of Rikitake systems, Lie bialgebras and bi-Hamiltonian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable deformations of a class of Rikitake dynamical systems are constructed by deforming their underlying Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structures as linearizations of Poisson--Lie structures on certain (dual) Lie groups. By taking into account that there exists a one-to one correspondence between Poisson--Lie groups and Lie bialgebra structures, a number of deformed Poisson coalgebras can be obtained, which allow the construction of integrable deformations of coupled Rikitake systems. Moreover, the integrals of the motion for coupled systems can be explicitly obtained by means of the deformed coproduct map. The same procedure can be also applied when the initial system is bi-Hamiltonian with respect to two different Lie-Poisson algebras. In this case, to preserve a bi-Hamiltonian structure under deformation, a common Lie bialgebra structure for the two Lie-Poisson structures has to be found. Coupled dynamical systems arising from this bi-Hamiltonian deformation scheme are also presented, and the use of collective `cluster variables', turns out to be enlightening in order to analyse their dynamical behaviour. As a general feature, the approach here presented provides a novel connection between Lie bialgebras and integrable dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive central limit theorem for a Brownian particle in a critically-correlated incompressible random drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of a diffusion process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ advected by a stationary random vector field which is assumed to be divergence-free, dihedrally symmetric in law and have a log-correlated potential. A special case includes $\nabla^\perp$ of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions. We show the variance of the diffusion process at a large time $t$ behaves like $2 c_* t (\log t)^{1/2}$, in a quenched sense and with a precisely determined, universal prefactor constant $c_*&gt;0$. We also prove a quenched invariance principle under this superdiffusive scaling. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization group argument in which we inductively analyze coarse-grained diffusivities, scale-by-scale. Our analysis leads to sharp homogenization and large-scale regularity estimates on the infinitesimal generator, which are subsequently transferred into quantitative information on the process.</description>

      <title>Least Non-Zero Singular Value and the Distribution of Eigenvectors of non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a tail bound for the least non-zero singular value of $A-z$ when $A$ is a random matrix and $z$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ in a neighbourhood of a given point $z_0$ in the bulk of the spectrum. The argument relies on a resolvent comparison and a tail bound for Gauss-divisible matrices. The latter can be obtained by the method of partial Schur decomposition. Using this bound we prove that any finite collection of components of a right eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue uniformly sampled from a neighbourhood of a point in the bulk is Gaussian. A byproduct of the calculation is an asymptotic formula for the odd moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial of real Gauss-divisible matrices.</description>

      <title>Is $\gamma_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory complete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter we introduce some field-theoretic approach for computing the critical properties of $\gamma_{KLS}$-generalized systems undergoing continuous phase transitions, namely $\gamma_{KLS}$-statistical field theory. From this new approach emerges the new generalized O($N$)$_{\gamma_{KLS}}$ universality class, which is capable of encompassing nonconventional critical exponents for real imperfect systems known as manganites not described by standard statistical field theory. We compare the generalized results with those obtained from measurements in manganites. The agreement was satisfactory, where the relative errors are $&lt; 5\%$ for the most of manganites used. Although the present approach describes the aforementioned nonconventional critical indices, we show that it is not complete. For example, it does not explain the results for some other manganites, being explained only for nonextensive statistical field theory recently introduced in literature. So, $\gamma_{KLS}$-statistical field theory has to be discarded for statistical mechanics generalization purposes.</description>

      <title>Modeling Shortest Paths in Polymeric Networks using Spatial Branching Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have established a connection between the macroscopic mechanical response of polymeric materials and the statistics of the shortest path (SP) length between distant nodes in the polymer network. Since these statistics can be costly to compute and difficult to study theoretically, we introduce a branching random walk (BRW) model to describe the SP statistics from the coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations of polymer networks. We postulate that the first passage time (FPT) of the BRW to a given termination site can be used to approximate the statistics of the SP between distant nodes in the polymer network. We develop a theoretical framework for studying the FPT of spatial branching processes and obtain an analytical expression for estimating the FPT distribution as a function of the cross-link density. We demonstrate by extensive numerical calculations that the distribution of the FPT of the BRW model agrees well with the SP distribution from the CGMD simulations. The theoretical estimate and the corresponding numerical implementations of BRW provide an efficient way of approximating the SP distribution in a polymer network. Our results have the physical meaning that by accounting for the realistic topology of polymer networks, extensive bond-breaking is expected to occur at a much smaller stretch than that expected from idealized models assuming periodic network structures. Our work presents the first analysis of polymer networks as a BRW and sets the framework for developing a generalizable spatial branching model for studying the macroscopic evolution of polymeric systems.</description>

Abstract: We provide spinor-based proof of the positivity of the Wang-Yau \cite{yau} quasi-local mass. More precisely we prove under an appropriate spin assumption that the gravitational mass bounded by a spacelike topological $2-$sphere is non-negative in a generic spacetime verifying dominant energy condition and vanishes only if the surface is embedded in the Minkowski space. This proof is purely quasi-local in nature and in particular does not rely on Bartanik's gluing and asymptotic extension construction \cite{bartnik1993quasi} and subsequent application of the Schoen-Yau \cite{schoen1979proof,schoen1981proof} positive mass theorem.</description>

      <title>Topological actions of Temperley-Lieb algebras and Representation Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Temperley-Lieb algebras $\textrm{TL}_n(\delta)$ at $\delta = 1$. Since $\delta = 1$, we can consider the multiplicative monoid structure and ask how this monoid acts on topological spaces. Given a monoid action on a topological space, we get an algebra action on each homology group. The main theorem of this paper explicitly deduces the representation structure of the homology groups in terms of a natural filtration associated with our $\textrm{TL}_n$-space. As a corollary of this result, we are able to study stability phenomena. There is a natural way to define representation stability in the context of $\textrm{TL}_n(1)$, and the presence of filtrations enables us to define a notion of topological stability. We are able to deduce that a filtration-stable sequence of $\textrm{TL}_n$-spaces results in representation-stable sequence of homology groups. This can be thought of as the analogue of the statement that the homology of configuration spaces forms a finitely generated $\textrm{FI}$-module.</description>

Abstract: We consider higher generalizations of both a (twisted) Poisson structure and the equivariant condition of a momentum map on a symplectic manifold. On a Lie algebroid over a (pre-)symplectic and (pre-)multisymplectic manifold, we introduce a Lie algebroid differential form called a compatible $E$-$n$-form. This differential form satisfies a compatibility condition, which is consistent with both the Lie algebroid structure and the (pre-)(multi)symplectic structure. There are many interesting examples such as a Poisson structure, a twisted Poisson structure and a twisted $R$-Poisson structure for a pre-$n$-plectic manifold. Moreover, momentum maps and momentum sections on symplectic manifolds, homotopy momentum maps and homotopy momentum sections on multisymplectic manifolds have this structure.</description>

We first consider two-dimensional unit-mass oscillators admitting a separable Hamiltonian description, i.e., $H = H_1 + H_2$, where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the Hamiltonians of two one-dimensional unit-mass oscillators; it is shown that there exists a third functionally-independent first integral $\Theta$, thereby ensuring superintegrablility. Various examples are explicitly worked out. We then consider position-dependent-mass oscillators and the Bateman pair, where the latter consists of a pair of dissipative linear oscillators. Quite remarkably, the Bateman pair is found to be superintegrable, despite admitting a Hamiltonian which cannot be separated into those of two isolated (non-interacting) one-dimensional oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple proof of a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of non-equilibrium steady states of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We demonstrate the applications of the sufficient condition using examples of the transverse-field Ising model, the XYZ model, and the tight-binding model with dephasing.</description>

      <title>Local near-field scattering data enables unique reconstruction of rough electric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is the study of the inverse point-source scattering problem, specifically in relation to a certain class of electric potentials. Our research provides a novel uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data, obtained from the near field pattern. Our work improves the work of Caro and Garcia, who investigated both the direct problem and the inverse problem with global near field data for critically singular and $\delta$-shell potentials. The primary contribution of our research is the introduction of a Runge approximation result for the near field data on the scattering problem which, in combination with an interior regularity argument, enables us to establish a uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data. Additionaly, we manage to consider a slightly wider class of potentials.</description>

      <title>Reality conditions for the KdV equation and exact quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper reality conditions for quasi-periodic solutions of the KdV equation are determined completely. As a result, solutions in the form of non-linear waves can be plotted and investigated.
  The full scope of obtaining finite-gap solutions of the KdV equation is presented. It is proven that the multiply periodic $\wp_{1,1}$-function on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve of arbitrary genus serves as the finite-gap solution, the genus coincides with the number of gaps. The subspace of the Jacobian variety where $\wp_{1,1}$, as well as other $\wp$-functions, are bounded and real-valued is found in any genus. This result covers every finite phase space of the KdV hierarchy, and can be extended to other completely integrable equations. A method of effective computation of this type of solutions is suggested, and illustrated in genera $2$ and $3$.</description>

      <title>The random field Ising chain domain-wall structure in the large interaction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the configurations of the nearest neighbor Ising ferromagnetic chain with IID centered and square integrable external random field in the limit in which the pairwise interaction tends to infinity. The available free energy estimates for this model show a strong form of disorder relevance, i.e., a strong effect of disorder on the free energy behavior, and our aim is to make explicit how the disorder affects the spin configurations. We give a quantitative estimate that shows that the infinite volume spin configurations are close to one explicit disorder dependent configuration when the interaction is large. Our results confirm predictions on this model obtained in D. S. Fisher, P. Le Doussal and C. Monthus (Phys. Rev. E 2001) by applying the renormalization group method introduced by D. S. Fisher (Phys. Rev. B 1995).</description>

      <title>Large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of $N_{\infty}$-soliton solutions for the focusing Hirota equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hirota equation is one of the higher-order extensions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and can describe the ultra-short optical pulse propagation in the form $ iq_t+\alpha(q_{xx}+ 2|q|^2q)+i\beta (q_{xxx}+ 6|q|^2q_x)=0,\, (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\, (\alpha,\,\beta\in\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we analytically explore the large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of a soliton gas (the limit $N\to \infty$ of $N$-soliton solutions) for the Hirota equation including the complex modified KdV equation by using the Riemann-Hilbert problems with discrete spectra restricted in intervals $(ia, ib)\cup (-ib, -ia)\, (0&lt;a&lt;b)$. We find that this soliton gas tends slowly to the Jaocbian elliptic wave solution with an error $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-1})$ (zero exponentially quickly ) as $x\to -\infty$ ($x\to +\infty$). We also present the long-time asymptotics of the soliton gas under the different velocity conditions: $x/t&gt;4\beta b^2,\, \xi_c&lt;x/t&lt;4\beta b^2,\, x/t&lt;\xi_c$. Moreover, we analyze the property of the soliton gas for the case of the discrete spectra filling uniformly a quadrature domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate multidimensional first-order quasi-linear systems and find necessary conditions for them to admit Hamiltonian formulation. The insufficiency of the conditions is related to the Poisson cohomology of the admissible Hamiltonian operators. We present in detail the example of two-dimensional, two-components systems of hydrodynamic type and of a real reduction of the 3-waves system.</description>

      <title>Bulk Universality for Real Matrices with Independent and Identically Distributed Entries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider real, Gauss-divisible matrices $A_{t}=A+\sqrt{t}B$, where $B$ is from the real Ginibre ensemble. We prove that the bulk correlation functions converge to a universal limit for $t=O(N^{-1/3+\epsilon})$ if $A$ satisfies certain local laws. If $A=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}(\xi_{jk})_{j,k=1}^{N}$ with $\xi_{jk}$ independent and identically distributed real random variables having zero mean, unit variance and finite moments, the Gaussian component can be removed using local laws proven by Bourgade--Yau--Yin, Alt--Erd\H{o}s--Kr\"{u}ger and Cipolloni--Erd\H{o}s--Schr\"{o}der and the four moment theorem of Tao--Vu.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of degrees for lattice equations: a singularity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of degree growth and algebraic entropy plays a crucial role in the field of discrete integrable systems. However, a general method for calculating degree growth for lattice equations (partial difference equations) is not yet known. Here we propose a new method to rigorously compute the exact degree of each iterate for lattice equations. Our strategy is to extend Halburd's method, which is a novel approach to computing the exact degree of each iterate for mappings (ordinary difference equations) from the singularity structure, to lattice equations. First, we illustrate, without rigorous discussion, how to calculate degrees for lattice equations using the lattice version of Halburd's method and discuss what problems we need to solve to make the method rigorous. We then provide a framework to ensure that all calculations are accurate and rigorous. We also discuss how to detect the singularity structure of a lattice equation. Our method is not only accurate and rigorous but also can easily be applied to a wide range of lattice equations.</description>

      <title>Twisted restricted conformal blocks of vertex operator algebras II: twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbicurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbicurves and establish an isomorphism between the space of twisted restricted conformal blocks and the space of twisted conformal blocks. The relationships among twisted (restricted) conformal blocks, $g$-twisted (restricted) correlation functions, and twisted intertwining operators are explored. Furthermore, by introducing a geometric generalization of Zhu's algebra and its modules, we obtain a description of the space of coinvariants by modules over associative algebras and show it is finite-dimensional under some conditions. In particular, a more conceptual proof of the $g$-twisted fusion rules theorem in vertex operator algebra theory is provided.</description>

      <title>Accumulated spectrograms for hyperuniform determinantal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the accumulated spectrogram associated to a locally trace class orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the corresponding determinantal point process is hyperuniform. We prove that a radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence, we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal phenomenon. Our result is a generalisation of a theorem by Abreu-Gr\"ochenig-Romero in [1] concerning time-frequency localization operators.</description>
