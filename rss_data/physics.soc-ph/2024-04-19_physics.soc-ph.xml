      <title>The sounds of science a symphony for many instruments and voices part II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its amazing quantitative successes and contributions to revolutionary technologies, physics currently faces many unsolved mysteries ranging from the meaning of quantum mechanics to the nature of the dark energy that will determine the future of the Universe. It is clearly prohibitive for the general reader, and even the best informed physicists, to follow the vast number of technical papers published in the thousands of specialized journals. For this reason, we have asked the leading experts across many of the most important areas of physics to summarise their global assessment of some of the most important issues. In lieu of an extremely long abstract summarising the contents, we invite the reader to look at the section headings and their authors, and then to indulge in a feast of stimulating topics spanning the current frontiers of fundamental physics from The Future of Physics by William D Phillips and What characterises topological effects in physics? by Gerard t Hooft through the contributions of the widest imaginable range of world leaders in their respective areas. This paper is presented as a preface to exciting developments by senior and young scientists in the years that lie ahead, and a complement to the less authoritative popular accounts by journalists.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Review and New Analysis Software for Single-file Pedestrian Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive examination of single-file experiments within the field of pedestrian dynamics, providing a thorough review from both theoretical and analytical perspectives. It begins by tracing the historical context of single-file movement studies in pedestrian dynamics. Then, the significance of understanding the fundamental relationships among density, speed, and flow in pedestrian dynamics through the lens of simple single-file systems is explored in depth. Furthermore, we investigate various traffic systems involving human or non-human entities such as ants, mice, bicycles, and cars, and provide insights. We explore the types of experimental setups, data collection methods, and influential factors that affect pedestrian movement. We also define and explain the common concepts concerning single-file movement, particularly in experimental research. Finally, we present a Python tool named ``SingleFileMovementAnalysis'' designed for analyzing single-file experimental data, specifically head trajectories. This tool provides a cohesive approach to preparing and calculating movement metrics like speed, density, and headway. The article aims to stimulate further research and underscore the areas where future researchers can contribute to advancing and enhancing single-file studies.</description>

      <title>Designing a sector-coupled European energy system robust to 60 years of historical weather data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As energy systems transform to rely on renewable energy and electrification, they encounter stronger year-to-year variability in energy supply and demand. However, most infrastructure planning is based on a single weather year, resulting in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we optimize energy infrastructure for a European energy system designed for net-zero CO$_2$ emissions in 62 different weather years. Subsequently, we fix the capacity layouts and simulate their operation in every weather year, to evaluate resource adequacy and CO$_2$ emissions abatement. We show that interannual weather variability causes variation of $\pm$10\% in total system cost. The most expensive capacity layout obtains the lowest net CO$_2$ emissions but not the highest resource adequacy. Instead, capacity layouts designed with years including compound weather events result in a more robust and cost-effective design. Deploying CO$_2$-emitting backup generation is a cost-effective robustness measure, which only increase CO$_2$ emissions marginally as the average CO$_2$ emissions remain less than 1\% of 1990 levels. Our findings highlight how extreme weather years drive investments in robustness measures, making them compatible with all weather conditions within six decades of historical weather data.</description>

      <title>Portrait comparison of binary and weighted Skill Relatedness Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compare Skill-Relatedness Networks (SRNs) for selected countries, that is to say statistically significant inter-industrial interactions representing latent skills exchanges derived from observed labor flows, a kind of industry spaces. Using data from Argentina (ARG), Germany (DEU) and Sweden (SWE), we compare their SRNs utilizing an information-theoretic method that permits to compare networks of "non-aligned" nodes, which is the case of interest. For each SRN we extract its portrait, a fingerprint of structural measures of the distributions of their shortest paths, and calculate their pairwise divergences. This allows us also to contrast differences in structural (binary) connectivity with differences in the information provided by the (weighted) skill relatedness indicator (SR). We find that, in the case of ARG, structural connectivity is very different from their counterpart in DEU and SWE, but through the glass of SR the distances analyzed are all substantially smaller and more alike. These results qualify the role of the SR indicator as revealing some hidden dimension different from connectivity alone, providing empirical support to the suggestion that industry spaces may differ across countries.</description>

      <title>Reflections on the denialism of the Earth's curvature based on the general public participation in the collective reproduction of Eratosthenes' experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the replication of scientific experiments, with the participation of the general public, as one of the possible strategies to confront science deniers. Using the social media of the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), the project entitled : The Magic of Physics and the Universe, invited the public to reproduce the experiment carried out by the Greek Eratosthenes over 2,100 years ago, which he proved that the Earth is spherical. We present a report of this experience to suggest that it is possible for citizens to experience scientific knowledge and observe the phenomena in a simple way, in order to develop a critical interpretation of false information that circulates in society. This proposal distinctively geeks to deconstruct the denial of the Earth's curvature through direct and collective participation of citizens in Eratosthenes' experiment, which permit more reflection on how the scientific method used to study this subject works.</description>

      <title>Nested Skills in Labor Ecosystems: A Hidden Dimension of Human Capital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern economies, characterized by their vast output of goods and services, operate through globally interconnected networks. As economies become more complex, so do these networks, coordinating increasingly diverse portfolios of specialized efforts and knowledge. In this study, we analyze U.S. survey data (2005--2019) to infer an underlying interdependency tree within the fabric of skill portfolios. Hierarchically constructed, this skill tree starts from widely needed, foundational abilities, constituting the root, and extends to highly specialized, niche skills required by select jobs at the extremities. The directionality is defined by the asymmetrical conditional probabilities of the presence of one skill given the existence of another. Examining 70 million job transitions in resumes and national surveys, we observe that individuals tend to delve deeper into these nested specialization paths as they ascend the career ladder to enjoy higher wage premiums. Nevertheless, we find the role of foundational skills for such ascent remains pivotal; without reinforcing them, the anticipated wage premiums may vanish. Hence, we further differentiate \textit{nested} skills from others, with the former building on common prerequisites while the latter does not, and analyze disparities in these skill gaps across different genders and racial/ethnic groups. Our analysis reveals a growing and concerning fragmentation in the divide between these two skill groups over the past two decades, suggesting further polarization within the job landscape. Our findings highlight the critical role of robust foundational skills as a stepping stone to specialization and the economic advantages it can confer, reinforcing the need for balanced skill development strategies in complex economies.</description>

      <title>Social Links vs. Language Barriers: Decoding the Global Spread of Streaming Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of the internet has allowed for the global distribution of content, redefining media communication and property structures through various streaming platforms. Previous studies successfully clarified the factors contributing to trends in each streaming service, yet the similarities and differences between platforms are commonly unexplored; moreover, the influence of social connections and cultural similarity is usually overlooked. We hereby examine the social aspects of three significant streaming services--Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube--with an emphasis on the dissemination of content across countries. Using two-year-long trending chart datasets, we find that streaming content can be divided into two types: video-oriented (Netflix) and audio-oriented (Spotify). This characteristic is differentiated by accounting for the significance of social connectedness and linguistic similarity: audio-oriented content travels via social links, but video-oriented content tends to spread throughout linguistically akin countries. Interestingly, user-generated contents, YouTube, exhibits a dual characteristic by integrating both visual and auditory characteristics, indicating the platform is evolving into unique medium rather than simply residing a midpoint between video and audio media.</description>

      <title>Urban highways are barriers to social ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban highways are common, especially in the US, making cities more car-centric. They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the unprecedented granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a new dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning.</description>
