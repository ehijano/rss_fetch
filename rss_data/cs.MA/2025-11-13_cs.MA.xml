      <title>Introduction to Automated Negotiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book is an introductory textbook targeted towards computer science students who are completely new to the topic of automated negotiation. It does not require any prerequisite knowledge, except for elementary mathematics and basic programming skills.
  This book comes with an simple toy-world negotiation framework implemented in Python that can be used by the readers to implement their own negotiation algorithms and perform experiments with them. This framework is small and simple enough that any reader who does not like to work in Python should be able to re-implement it very quickly in any other programming language of their choice.</description>

      <title>Convergence dynamics of Agent-to-Agent Interactions with Misaligned objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in multi-agent scenarios. We consider the setup in which two language model based agents perform iterative gradient updates toward their respective objectives in-context, using the output of the other agent as input. We characterize the generation dynamics associated with the interaction when the agents have misaligned objectives, and show that this results in a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target - with the residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the geometry induced by the prompt of each agent. We establish the conditions for asymmetric convergence and provide an algorithm that provably achieves an adversarial result, producing one-sided success. Experiments with trained transformer models as well as GPT$5$ for the task of in-context linear regression validate the theory. Our framework presents a setup to study, predict, and defend multi-agent systems; explicitly linking prompt design and interaction setup to stability, bias, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Achieving Equilibrium under Utility Heterogeneity: An Agent-Attention Framework for Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent multi-objective systems (MAMOS) have emerged as powerful frameworks for modelling complex decision-making problems across various real-world domains, such as robotic exploration, autonomous traffic management, and sensor network optimisation. MAMOS offers enhanced scalability and robustness through decentralised control and more accurately reflects inherent trade-offs between conflicting objectives. In MAMOS, each agent uses utility functions that map return vectors to scalar values. Existing MAMOS optimisation methods face challenges in handling heterogeneous objective and utility function settings, where training non-stationarity is intensified due to private utility functions and the associated policies. In this paper, we first theoretically prove that direct access to, or structured modeling of, global utility functions is necessary for the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium under decentralised execution constraints. To access the global utility functions while preserving the decentralised execution, we propose an Agent-Attention Multi-Agent Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (AA-MAMORL) framework. Our approach implicitly learns a joint belief over other agents' utility functions and their associated policies during centralised training, effectively mapping global states and utilities to each agent's policy. In execution, each agent independently selects actions based on local observations and its private utility function to approximate a BNE, without relying on inter-agent communication. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both a custom-designed MAMO Particle environment and the standard MOMALand benchmark. The results demonstrate that access to global preferences and our proposed AA-MAMORL significantly improve performance and consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Efficient Communication Protocols for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities in distributed environments. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), communication enables coordination but can lead to inefficient information exchange, since agents may generate redundant or non-essential messages. While prior work has focused on boosting task performance with information exchange, the existing research lacks a thorough investigation of both the appropriate definition and the optimization of communication protocols (communication topology and message). To fill this gap, we introduce a generalized framework for learning multi-round communication protocols that are both effective and efficient. Within this framework, we propose three novel Communication Efficiency Metrics (CEMs) to guide and evaluate the learning process: the Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) for efficiency-augmented optimization, and the Topology Efficiency Index (TEI) for explicit evaluation. We integrate IEI and SEI as the adjusted loss functions to promote informative messaging and role specialization, while using TEI to quantify the trade-off between communication volume and task performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our learned communication protocol can significantly enhance communication efficiency and achieves better cooperation performance with improved success rates.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PIBT via Multi-Action Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PIBT is a rule-based Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solver, widely used as a low-level planner or action sampler in many state-of-the-art approaches. Its primary advantage lies in its exceptional speed, enabling action selection for thousands of agents within milliseconds by considering only the immediate next timestep. However, this short-horizon design leads to poor performance in scenarios where agents have orientation and must perform time-consuming rotation actions. In this work, we present an enhanced version of PIBT that addresses this limitation by incorporating multi-action operations. We detail the modifications introduced to improve PIBT's performance while preserving its hallmark efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method, when combined with graph-guidance technique and large neighborhood search optimization, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the online LMAPF-T setting.</description>

      <title>Mina: A Multilingual LLM-Powered Legal Assistant Agent for Bangladesh for Empowering Access to Justice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.</description>

      <title>QOC DAO - Stepwise Development Towards an AI Driven Decentralized Autonomous Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a structured approach to improving decision making in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) through the integration of the Question-Option-Criteria (QOC) model and AI agents. We outline a stepwise governance framework that evolves from human led evaluations to fully autonomous, AI-driven processes. By decomposing decisions into weighted, criterion based evaluations, the QOC model enhances transparency, fairness, and explainability in DAO voting. We demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) and stakeholder aligned AI agents can support or automate evaluations, while statistical safeguards help detect manipulation. The proposed framework lays the foundation for scalable and trustworthy governance in the Web3 ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Information-Driven Fault Detection and Identification for Multi-Agent Spacecraft Systems: Collaborative On-Orbit Inspection Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a global-to-local, task-aware fault detection and identification (FDI) framework for multi-spacecraft systems conducting collaborative inspection missions in low Earth orbit. The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.</description>

      <title>Modeling multi-agent motion dynamics in immersive rooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive rooms are increasingly popular augmented reality systems that support multi-agent interactions within a virtual world. However, despite extensive content creation and technological developments, insights about perceptually-driven social dynamics, such as the complex movement patterns during virtual world navigation, remain largely underexplored. Computational models of motion dynamics can help us understand the underlying mechanism of human interaction in immersive rooms and develop applications that better support spatially distributed interaction. In this work, we propose a new agent-based model of emergent human motion dynamics. The model represents human agents as simple spatial geometries in the room that relocate and reorient themselves based on the salient virtual spatial objects they approach. Agent motion is modeled as an interactive process combining external diffusion-driven influences from the environment with internal self-propelling interactions among agents. Further, we leverage simulation-based inference (SBI) to show that the governing parameters of motion patterns can be estimated from simple observables. Our results indicate that the model successfully captures action-related agent properties but exposes local non-identifiability linked to environmental awareness. We argue that our simulation-based approach paves the way for creating adaptive, responsive immersive rooms -- spaces that adjust their interfaces and interactions based on human collective movement patterns and spatial attention.</description>

      <title>Low-cost Multi-agent Fleet for Acoustic Cooperative Localization Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world underwater testing for multi-agent autonomy presents substantial financial and engineering challenges. In this work, we introduce the Configurable Underwater Group of Autonomous Robots (CoUGARs) as a low-cost, configurable autonomous-underwater-vehicle (AUV) platform for multi-agent autonomy research. The base design costs less than $3,000 USD (as of May 2025) and is based on commercially-available and 3D-printed parts, enabling quick customization for various sensor payloads and configurations. Our current expanded model is equipped with a doppler velocity log (DVL) and ultra-short-baseline (USBL) acoustic array/transducer to support research on acoustic-based cooperative localization. State estimation, navigation, and acoustic communications software has been developed and deployed using a containerized software stack and is tightly integrated with the HoloOcean simulator. The system was tested both in simulation and via in-situ field trials in Utah lakes and reservoirs.</description>

      <title>AI Founding Fathers: A Case Study of GIS Search in Multi-Agent Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.</description>

      <title>Solving a Million-Step LLM Task with Zero Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.</description>

      <title>Enabling Agents to Communicate Entirely in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Steering Opinion Dynamics in Signed Time-Varying Networks via External Control Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies targeted opinion formation in multi-agent systems evolving over signed, time-varying directed graphs. The dynamics of each agent's state follow a Laplacian-based update rule driven by both cooperative and antagonistic interactions in the presence of exogenous factors. We formulate these exogenous factors as external control inputs and establish a suitable controller design methodology enabling collective opinion to converge to any desired steady-state configuration, superseding the natural emergent clustering or polarization behavior imposed by persistently structurally balanced influential root nodes. Our approach leverages upper Dini derivative analysis and Gr\"onwall-type inequalities to establish exponential convergence for opinion magnitude towards the desired steady state configuration on networks with uniform quasi-strong $\delta$-connectivity. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized collision avoidance remains a core challenge for scalable multi-robot systems. One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation. Our results demonstrate that CoRL-MPPI significantly improves navigation efficiency (measured by success rate and makespan) and safety, enabling agile and robust multi-robot navigation.</description>

      <title>Steering Noncooperative Games Through Conjecture Design</title>

Abstract: In dynamic noncooperative games, each player makes conjectures about other players' reactions before choosing a strategy. However, resulting equilibria may be multiple and do not always lead to desirable outcomes. These issues are typically addressed separately, for example, through opponent modelling and incentive design. Drawing inspiration from conjectural variations games, we propose an incentive design framework in which a coordinator first computes an equilibrium by optimizing a predefined objective function, then communicates this equilibrium as a target for the players to reach. In a centralized setting, the coordinator also optimizes the conjectures to steer the players towards the target. In decentralized settings, players independently compute conjectures and update their strategies based on individual targets. We provide a guarantee of equilibrium existence in both cases. This framework uses conjectures not only to guide the system towards desirable outcomes but also to decouple the game into independent optimization problems, enabling efficient computation and parallelization in large-scale settings. We illustrate our theoretical results on classical representative noncooperative games, demonstrating its application potential.</description>

      <title>Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03288v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Delay Compensation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation typically comprises multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities within the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.

      <title>Distributionally Robust Markov Games with Average Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributionally robust Markov games (DR-MGs) with the average-reward criterion, a crucial framework for multi-agent decision-making under uncertainty over extended horizons. We first establish a connection between the best-response policies and the optimal policies for the induced single-agent problems. Under a standard irreducible assumption, we derive a correspondence between the optimal policies and the solutions of the robust Bellman equation, and derive the existence of stationary Nash Equilibrium (NE) based on these results. We also study a more general weakly communicating setting. We construct a set-valued map and show its value is a subset of the best-response policies, convex and upper hemi-continuous, which imply the existence of NE. We then introduce Robust Nash-Iteration, and provide convergence guarantees. Finally, we connect average-reward NE to discounted robust equilibria, showing approximation as the discount factor approaches one. Our studies provide comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic foundation for decision-making in complex, uncertain, and long-running multi-player environments.</description>

      <title>Causal Graph Dynamics and Kan Extensions</title>

Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic. The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling. The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones. On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled. In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well. This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancements in systems deploying large language models (LLMs), as well as improvements in their ability to act as agents with predefined templates, provide an opportunity to conduct qualitative, individualized assessments, creating a bridge between qualitative and quantitative methods for candidates seeking career progression. In this paper, we develop a platform that allows candidates to run AI-led interviews to assess their current career stage and curate coursework to enable progression to the next level. Our approach incorporates predefined career trajectories, associated skills, and a method to recommend the best resources for gaining the necessary skills for advancement. We employ OpenAI API calls along with expertly compiled chat templates to assess candidate competence. Our platform is highly configurable due to the modularity of the development, is easy to deploy and use, and available as a web interface where the only requirement is candidate resumes in PDF format. We demonstrate a use-case centered on software engineering and intend to extend this platform to be domain-agnostic, requiring only regular updates to chat templates as industries evolve.</description>
