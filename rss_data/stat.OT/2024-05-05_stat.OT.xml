      <title>Which Identities Are Mobilized: Towards an automated detection of social group appeals in political texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a computational text classification strategy to identify references to social groups in European party manifestos and beyond. Our methodology uses machine learning techniques, including BERT and large language models, to capture group-based appeals in texts. We propose to combine automated identification of social groups using the Mistral-7B-v0.1 Large Language Model with Embedding Space-based filtering to extend a sample of core social groups to all social groups mentioned in party manifestos. By applying this approach to RRP's and mainstream parties' group images in manifestos, we explore whether electoral dynamics explain similarities in group appeals and potential convergence or divergence in party strategies. Contrary to expectations, increasing RRP support or mainstream parties' vote loss does not necessarily lead to convergence in group appeals. Nonetheless, our methodology enables mapping similarities in group appeals across time and space in 15 European countries from 1980 to 2021 and can be transferred to other use cases as well.</description>

      <title>Improved Semi-Parametric Bounds for Tail Probability and Expected Loss: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many management decisions involve accumulated random realizations for which the expected value and variance are assumed to be known. We revisit the tail behavior of such quantities when individual realizations are independent, and we develop new sharper bounds on the tail probability and expected linear loss. The underlying distribution is semi-parametric in the sense that it remains unrestricted other than the assumed mean and variance. Our bounds complement well-established results in the literature, including those based on aggregation, which often fail to take full account of independence and use less elegant proofs. New insights include a proof that in the non-identical case, the distributions attaining the bounds have the equal range property, and that the impact of each random variable on the expected value of the sum can be isolated using an extension of the Korkine identity. We show that the new bounds %not only complement the extant results but also open up abundant practical applications, including improved pricing of product bundles, more precise option pricing, more efficient insurance design, and better inventory management. For example, we establish a new solution to the optimal bundling problem, yielding a 17\% uplift in per-bundle profits, and a new solution to the inventory problem, yielding a 5.6\% cost reduction for a model with 20 retailers.</description>
