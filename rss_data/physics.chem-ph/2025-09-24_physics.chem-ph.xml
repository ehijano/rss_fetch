      <title>Discovery of Sustainable Refrigerants through Physics-Informed RL Fine-Tuning of Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Beyond Ground State Electronic Structure: A Review of Progress Toward Quantum Chemistry Out of the Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers the promise of revolutionizing quantum chemistry by enabling the solution of chemical problems for substantially less computational cost. While most demonstrations of quantum computation to date have focused on resolving the energies of the electronic ground states of small molecules, the field of quantum chemistry is far broader than ground state chemistry; equally important to practicing chemists are chemical reaction dynamics and reaction mechanism prediction. Here, we review progress toward and the potential of quantum computation for understanding quantum chemistry beyond the ground state, including for reaction mechanisms, reaction dynamics, and finite temperature quantum chemistry. We discuss algorithmic and other considerations these applications share, as well as differences that make them unique. We also highlight the potential speedups these applications may realize and challenges they may face. We hope that this discussion stimulates further research into how quantum computation may better inform experimental chemistry in the future.</description>

      <title>SMILES-Inspired Transfer Learning for Quantum Operators in Generative Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the inherent limitations of traditional Variational Quantum Eigensolver(VQE) algorithms, the integration of deep generative models into hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, specifically the Generative Quantum Eigensolver(GQE), represents a promising innovative approach. However, taking the Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles(UCCSD) ansatz which is widely used in quantum chemistry as an example, different molecular systems require constructions of distinct quantum operators. Considering the similarity of different molecules, the construction of quantum operators utilizing the similarity can reduce the computational cost significantly. Inspired by the SMILES representation method in computational chemistry, we developed a text-based representation approach for UCCSD quantum operators by leveraging the inherent representational similarities between different molecular systems. This framework explores text pattern similarities in quantum operators and employs text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework. Our approach with a naive baseline setting demonstrates knowledge transfer between different molecular systems for ground-state energy calculations within the GQE paradigm. This discovery offers significant benefits for hybrid quantum-classical computation of molecular ground-state energies, substantially reducing computational resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Computation of the heat capacity of water from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water is a unique solvent with many remarkable properties. An example is its exceptionally high heat capacity, which plays an important role in storing and transporting thermal energy, with implications for many processes from regulating the body temperature of living organisms to moderating our climate at the global scale. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the heat capacity of water from first principles, highly accurate computer simulations are required. Apart from a reliable description of the atomic interactions, the presence of light hydrogen atoms necessitates the explicit consideration of nuclear quantum effects through path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. The high computational costs of PIMD simulations, which are even further increased by the need for an extensive statistical sampling of energy fluctuations to determine the heat capacity, can be strongly reduced by replacing first principles calculations with machine learning potentials to represent the atomic interactions. In this study, we use high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) constructed from density functional theory calculations employing the RPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 functionals. To further enhance the computational performance, we introduce a highly efficient PIMD algorithm computing in parallel not only the energies and forces but also the coordinate and thermostat time evolutions. Using this approach, we are able to determine converged data for the heat capacity from a 4 ns simulation employing 128 beads. In particular, for the revPBE0-D3 functional we find excellent agreement with experiment, providing evidence that our approach represents a promising framework for the quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water and aqueous solutions.</description>

      <title>Colossal Effect of Nanopore Surface Ionic Charge on the Dynamics of Confined Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial interactions significantly alter the fundamental properties of water confined in mesoporous structures, with crucial implications for geological, physicochemical, and biological processes. Herein, we focused on the effect of changing the surface ionic charge of nanopores with comparable pore size (3.5-3.8 nm) on the dynamics of confined liquid water. The control of the pore surface ionicity was achieved by using two periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) containing either neutral or charged forms of a chemically similar bridging unit. The effect on the dynamics of water at the nanoscale was investigated in the temperature range of 245 -300 K, encompassing the glass transition by incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS), For both types of PMOs, the water dynamics revealed two distinct types of molecular motions: rapid local movements and translational jump diffusion. While the neutral PMO induces a moderate confinement effect, we show that the charged PMO drastically slows down water dynamics, reducing translational diffusion by a factor of four and increasing residence time by an order of magnitude. Notably, by changing the pore filling values, we demonstrate that for charged pore this effect extends beyond the interfacial layer of surface-bound water molecules to encompass the entire pore volume. Thus, our observation indicates a dramatic change in the long-range character of the interaction of water confined in nanopores with surface ionic charge compared to a simple change in hydrophilicity. This is relevant for the understanding of a broad variety of applications in (nano)technological phenomena and processes, such as nanofiltration and membrane design.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Model for Energy Decomposition Analysis in Aqueous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals provides detailed insights into intermolecular bonding by decomposing the total molecular binding energy into physically meaningful components. Here, we develop a neural network EDA model capable of predicting the electron delocalization energy component of water molecules, which captures the stabilization arising from charge transfer between occupied absolutely localized molecular orbitals of one molecule and the virtual orbitals of another. Exploiting the locality assumption of the electronic structure, our model enables accurate prediction of electron delocalization energies for molecular systems far beyond the size accessible to conventional density functional theory calculations, while maintaining its accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by modeling hydration effects in large molecular complexes, specifically in metal-organic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Grand Canonical Global Optimization with On-the-fly-trained Machine-learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of nanostructued materials under reactive environments is challenging due to the complexity of the structural motifs involved and their chemical transformations. Global optimization approaches allow predicting stable structures for targeted materials but addressing the configurational and compositional search spaces is both computationally demanding and inefficient, especially when first principles calculations are required. In this work, we implement and evaluate a computationally efficient grand canonical global optimization algorithm able to identify stable structures and chemical states of targeted systems under given reaction conditions (e.g. reactant pressure and temperature). The algorithm leverages an on-the-fly trained machine-learning interatomic potential based on sparse Gaussian Process Regression and the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to reduce the number of first principles energy evaluations carried out during global optimization searches. The \textit{ab initio} thermodynamics framework is incorporated to approximate the Gibbs energy of evaluated candidates, performing environment-aware optimizations over multiple stoichiometries. We demonstrate the computational performance of this approach and its ability to reproduce some literature examples.</description>

      <title>Enhanced White-Light Emission from Self-Trapped Excitons in Antimony and Bismuth Halides through Structural Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton (STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality, connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations, such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials for Long-Range Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have emerged as a revolutionary class of force-field models in molecular simulations, delivering quantum-mechanical accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost and enabling the simulation of large-scale systems over extended timescales. However, they often focus on modeling local environments, neglecting crucial long-range interactions. We propose a Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net), a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms. The method is demonstrated effective for a broad range of long-range systems.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Machine Learning Potentials for Chemical Reaction Network Explorations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in computational chemistry facilitate the automated quantum chemical exploration of chemical reaction networks for the in-silico prediction of synthesis pathways, yield, and selectivity. However, the underlying quantum chemical energy calculations require vast computational resources, limiting these explorations severely in practice. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer a solution to increase computational efficiency, while retaining the accuracy of reliable first-principles data used for their training. Unfortunately, MLPs will be limited in their generalization ability within chemical (reaction) space, if the underlying training data are not representative for a given application. Within the framework of automated reaction network exploration, where new reactants or reagents composed of any elements from the periodic table can be introduced, this lack of generalizability will be the rule rather than the exception. Here, we therefore evaluate the benefits of the lifelong MLP concept in this context. Lifelong MLPs push their adaptability by efficient continual learning of additional data. We propose an improved learning algorithm for lifelong adaptive data selection yielding efficient integration of new data while previous expertise is preserved. In this way, we can reach chemical accuracy in reaction search trials.</description>

Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Fingerprints of Strained Polymers: A Spectroscopic Pathway to Mechanical State Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra. Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Model for Predicting Chemical Products from Generic SMARTS Templates with Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05810v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a set featuring 20 generic reaction templates written in SMARTS, a pattern-based notation designed to describe substructures and reactivity. Additionally, we introduce ProPreT5, a T5-based model specifically adapted for chemistry and, to the best of our knowledge, the first language model capable of directly handling and applying SMARTS reaction templates. To further improve generalization, we propose the first augmentation strategy for SMARTS, which injects structural diversity at the pattern level. Trained on augmented templates, ProPreT5 demonstrates strong predictive performance and generalization to unseen reactions. Together, these contributions provide a novel and practical alternative to current methods, advancing the field of template-based reaction prediction.</description>

      <title>The Open DAC 2025 Dataset for Sorbent Discovery in Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying useful sorbent materials for direct air capture (DAC) from humid air remains a challenge. We present the Open DAC 2025 (ODAC25) dataset, a significant expansion and improvement upon ODAC23 (Sriram et al., ACS Central Science, 10 (2024) 923), comprising nearly 60 million DFT single-point calculations for CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and O$_2$ adsorption in 15,000 MOFs. ODAC25 introduces chemical and configurational diversity through functionalized MOFs, high-energy GCMC-derived placements, and synthetically generated frameworks. ODAC25 also significantly improves upon the accuracy of DFT calculations and the treatment of flexible MOFs in ODAC23. Along with the dataset, we release new state-of-the-art machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ODAC25 and evaluate them on adsorption energy and Henry's law coefficient predictions.</description>

      <title>Energy dependent Chemical Interface Damping induced by 1-Decanethiol Self-Assembled Monolayer on Au(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chemical interface damping (CID) effect increases the collision frequency of free electrons in metals by changes of the metal surface. We have now experimentally disentangled the two contributions to CID: induced roughness and direct charge transfer. The latter is an important area of research in photoelectrochemistry with potential applications in light-induced chemical reactions. We present a broadband investigation of the CID effect on Au(111) covered by a self-assembled monolayer of decanethiol. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements show a photon energy dependent increase of collision frequency. We observe a constant, photon energy independent contribution, which is attributed to induced roughness and a contribution that linearly increases with photon energy from about 1 eV upwards which we attribute to direct charge transfer. The onset of the charge transfer mechanism corresponds to occupied orbitals of thiols bound to the Au surface, as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</description>
