      <title>Classical Solutions of Higher Dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs System With Nontrivial Potential: Global Existence and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs system in the framework of Bondi coordinates. As a first step, the problem is reduced to a single first-order integro-differential equation by defining a generalized ansatz function. Then, we employ contraction mapping to show that there exists the unique fixed point of the problem. For a given small initial data, we prove the existence of a global classical solution. Finally, by introducing local mass and local charge functions in higher dimensions, we also show the completeness property of the spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Can Hubble tension be eased by invoking a finite range for gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of the Hubble constant in the past few decades has increasingly become more accurate with the advance of new techniques. But its value seems to depend on the epoch at which the measurements are made. The Planck estimate of the Hubble constant from the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the early universe is about 67 km/s/Mpc, whereas that obtained from the distance indicators at the current epoch is about 73-74 km/s/Mpc. This discrepancy between the two groups of measurement is termed as the Hubble tension which has gained much attention in the past few decades with growing significance as measurements from both, the early and the late universe, studies continue to produce results with increasing precision. In this work, we propose a modification to gravity by considering a finite range gravitational field as an alternate explanation for this discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Controlled closed timelike geodesics in a rotating Alcubierre spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two modifications to the rotating Alcubierre metric [1], which was shown to permit closed timelike curves (CTCs). We find that if the rotation rate of the spacetime is made spatially dependent, in certain cases there exist simple approximate timelike geodesics that are also CTCs, provided that the velocity of the warp bubble varies slowly. The second modification is essentially the original Alcubierre metric [ 2 ] with a periodic boundary, resulting in a cylindrical spacetime which can also be related to the rotating Alcubierre metric. Furthermore, this spacetime contains simple exact timelike geodesics that are also CTCs. In both modifications, the CTC geodesics that we have found allow for a simple model of a particle interacting with a CTC for a finite proper time interval, entering and exiting in chronology-respecting space. Given the simplicity of both of these exotic spacetimes, despite their questionable physical realisability, we suggest that they may be useful in studies of quantum fields near CTCs.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: Extreme mass-ratio limit and final memory offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect is a strong-field relativistic phenomenon that is associated with a persistent change in the GW strain after the passage of a GW. The nonlinear effect arises from interactions of GWs themselves in the wave zone and is an observable effect connected to the infrared properties of general relativity. The detection of the GW memory effect is possible with LIGO and Virgo in a population of binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers or from individual events with next-generation ground- and space-based GW detectors or pulsar timing arrays. Matched-filtering-based searches for the GW memory require accurate, and preferably rapid-to-evaluate waveform models of the memory effect's GW signal. One important element of such a waveform model is a model for the final memory offset -- namely, the net change in strain between early and late times. In this paper, we construct a model for the final memory offset from the merger of nonspinning BBH systems in quasicircular orbits. A novel ingredient of this model is that we first compute the memory signal for extreme mass-ratio inspirals using a high post-Newtonian-order analytic calculation, and we use this analytical result to fix the coefficient in the fit which is linear in the mass-ratio. The resulting memory-offset fit could be used for detecting the GW memory for binaries that merge on a timescale that is short relative to the inverse of the low-frequency cutoff of a GW detector. Additionally, this fit will be useful for analytic waveform models of the GW memory signals in the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Generative Flow Networks in Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin foams arose as the covariant (path integral) formulation of quantum gravity depicting transition amplitudes between different quantum geometry states. As such, they provide a scheme to study the no boundary proposal, specifically the nothing to something transition and compute relevant observables using high performance computing (HPC). Following recent advances, where stochastic algorithms (Markov Chain Monte Carlo-MCMC) were used, we employ Generative Flow Networks, a newly developed machine learning algorithm to compute the expectation value of the dihedral angle for a 4-simplex and compare the results with previous works.</description>

      <title>Rapid Likelihood Free Inference of Compact Binary Coalescences using Accelerated Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a gravitational-wave parameter estimation algorithm, AMPLFI, based on likelihood-free inference using normalizing flows. The focus of AMPLFI is to perform real-time parameter estimation for candidates detected by machine-learning based compact binary coalescence search, Aframe. We present details of our algorithm and optimizations done related to data-loading and pre-processing on accelerated hardware. We train our model using binary black-hole (BBH) simulations on real LIGO-Virgo detector noise. Our model has $\sim 6$ million trainable parameters with training times $\lesssim 24$ hours. Based on online deployment on a mock data stream of LIGO-Virgo data, Aframe + AMPLFI is able to pick up BBH candidates and infer parameters for real-time alerts from data acquisition with a net latency of $\sim 6$s.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Friedmann's Equations and Cosmological Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein equations of general relativity reduce, when the spacetime metric is of the Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker type governing an isotropic and homogeneous universe, to the Friedmann equations, which is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, determining the law of evolution of the spatial scale factor, in terms of the Hubble ``constant''.
  It is a challenging task, not always possible, to solve these equations. In this talk, we present some insights from solving and analyzing the Friedmann equations and their implications to evolutionary cosmology. In particular, in the Chaplygin fluid universe, we derive a universal formula for the asymptotic exponential growth rate of the scale factor which indicates that, as far as there is a tiny presence of nonlinear (exotic) matter, linear (conventional) matter makes contribution to the dark energy, which becomes significant near the phantom divide line. Joint work with Shouxin Chen, Gary W. Gibbons, and Yijun Li.</description>

      <title>Reduced geometry and its role in explicit spacetime symmetry violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompatibility of explicit diffeomorphism violation with Riemannian geometry within the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME) is revisited. We review two methods of how to deal with this problem. The first is based on an approach proposed originally by St\"{u}ckelberg and the latter is to restrict spacetime geometry via the dynamical field equations and the second Bianchi identity. Moreover, a third technique is introduced, which is novel and relies on isometries of a gravitational system. Our conclusion is that an SME background field configuration compatible with Riemannian geometry is more likely to be determined the more diffeomorphisms are isometries of the particular system. This finding has the potential to provide an alternative treatment of explicit spacetime symmetry violation in gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to Hawking Radiation via GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the effects of a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we incorporate the effects of GUP into the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling process for Hawking radiation. To this effect, we observe that results obtained due to GUP correction resemble that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{om} black hole, showing similarities to the nature of an electric charge. We also find that, within this framework, the emission is not purely thermal, thus addressing the information loss problem through the correlation function.</description>

      <title>Higgs Mechanism for the Ashtekar Self-Dual Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Higgs mechanism for the self-dual spin connection (also known as the Ashtekar connection), using the Pleba\'{n}ski formulation of gravity. We develop our formalism within the framework of the chiral action and derive the equations of motion of the theory. One particular test model is explored: since anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the theory, a modified version of the spatially flat Bianchi I model with two different scale factors is considered. We apply our formalism and derive the Friedmann equations which regulate the scale factors and the Higgs field. We also present a Proca-like term for the connection, which when reduced to minisuperspace with a positive $\Lambda$ yields a De Sitter universe with the solution scaled by a constant that depends on the mass of the gauge fields. We finally investigate the effect of these mass terms on gravitational waves and find that the wave equation remains unchanged relatively to GR; however the Weyl tensor is scaled by a constant which depends on the mass of the connection components.</description>

      <title>Tidal forces in collapsing compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate tidal forces in the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) metric, focusing on both hidden and locally visible singularities. We discuss the strength of these singularities in terms of deformationally strong singularities. Specifically, we analyze tidal forces in LTB spacetime, calculating radial and angular tidal forces and Jacobi fields for the radially co-moving shell. To provide a comparative study, we consider both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases. The matter field distribution at one-time slice can differ significantly from another, highlighting the potential for time-dependent tidal deformation as a distinct observational signature. We focus on a specific feature: the time-varying maximum of stretching in the radial tidal force, which we term the "critical tidal boundary." In the inhomogeneous case, close to singularity time ($t&lt;t_{s}$), the magnitudes of tidal forces vary substantially, with significant differences in compressive and stretching forces within a small physical radius $R(t,r)$. The resulting singularity in the LTB metrics at the end state of gravitational collapse appears to be an Ori-strong singularity, characterized by infinite tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes of Loop Quantum Black Holes Formed from Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field in the background of a large class of quantum black holes that can be formed from gravitational collapse of a dust fluid in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. The loop quantum black holes (LQBHs) are characterized by three free parameters, one of which is the mass parameter, while the other two are purely due to quantum geometric effects. Among these two quantum parameters, one is completely fixed by black hole thermodynamics and its effects are negligible for macroscopic black holes, while the second parameter is completely free (in principle). In the studies of the QNMs of such LQBHs, we pay particular attention to the difference of the QNMs between LQBHs and classical ones, so that they can be observed for the current and forthcoming gravitational wave observations, whereby place the LQBH theory directly under the test of observations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and phase transition of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a generalized parameter space, regular black holes can be regarded as non-singular solutions under specific parameters in Einstein gravity theory coupled with non-linear electromagnetic fields. Following this concept, we investigate the thermodynamic states and phase transitions of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes, revealing that the system can be classified into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on whether it adopts a pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime without event horizons or a Bardeen-AdS black hole as its phase state, each exhibiting distinct thermodynamic properties. If one includes the Bardeen-AdS black holes in the system (Type I), there will be three distinct black hole states and the phase transitions between them are analogous to the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes. On the other hand, if the pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime is included (Type II), an additional tiny black hole state emerges. A phase transition reminiscent of the Hawking-Page transition was found. Significantly, in this scenario, thermodynamical characteristic curves exhibit discontinuous behavior, which attributes to the multiple horizons. The presence of a Bardeen-AdS black hole within the phase structure of the Bardeen-AdS-class black hole profoundly modifies the thermodynamical properties of the system, highlighting the novel aspects of regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Penrose Process and Kerr Black Hole Mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the negative energy orbits and energy extraction efficiency using the magnetic Penrose process in various regular black hole geometries surrounded by electromagnetic fields. Utilizing numerical simulations, we analyze the efficiency of this process in Kerr and Simpson-Visser geometries, focusing on extremal black holes. Interestingly, our study demonstrates that the energy extraction efficiency remains indistinguishable between Kerr and Simpson-Visser geometries, regardless of the regularization parameter ($l$); this trend is consistent with previous studies of the Penrose process and superradiance. Additionally, we present results for the rotating Hayward black hole, showing that efficiency is influenced by spin and deviation parameters ($g$), as well as the induced magnetic field and charge of the compact object. Notably, we observe that energy extraction efficiency is highest in the rotating Hayward black hole compared to Kerr and Simpson-Visser geometries, particularly in scenarios where the magnetic field and charge are minimal. Our study highlights the significant role of spin, charge and magnetic field characteristics in maximizing energy extraction efficiency, particularly in the rotating Hayward black hole context.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical insights into magnetic Penrose process around parameterized Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the parameterized Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) black hole (BH) spacetime in the presence of an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field. We first examine the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radii for both neutral and charged test particles, demonstrating that the deformation parameters, $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, reduce the ISCO values. Subsequently, we assess the energy efficiency of the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) for an axially symmetric parameterized BH, analyzing the effects of the deformation parameters and the magnetic field on the energy extraction process. Our findings indicate that the rotational deformation parameter $\delta_2$ is crucial for the efficiency of energy extraction from the BH. The synergy between the rotational deformation parameter and the magnetic field significantly boosts the energy extraction efficiency, with values exceeding $100\%$. Interestingly, for extremal BHs with negative $\delta_2$ values, the energy efficiency increases, in contrast to Kerr BHs where the MPP effect diminishes. Additionally, we explore the astrophysical implications of the MPP by deriving the maximum energy of a proton escaping from the KRZ parameterized BH due to the beta decay of a free neutron near the horizon. Our results show that negative $\delta_2$ values require stronger magnetic fields to achieve equivalent energy levels for high-energy protons, providing deeper insights into high-energy astrophysical phenomena around the parameterized BH.</description>

      <title>(In)stability of de Sitter Quasinormal Mode spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider how the quasinormal spectrum for the conformal wave operator on the static patch of de Sitter changes in response to the addition of a small potential. Since the quasinormal modes and co-modes are explicitly known, we are able to give explicit formulae for the instantaneous rate of change of each frequency in terms of the perturbing potential. We verify these exact computations numerically using a novel technique extending the spectral hyperboloidal approach of Jaramillo et al. (2021). We propose a definition for a family of pseudospectra that we show capture the instability properties of the quasinormal frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for un-modelled burst gravitational wave signals return potential candidates for short duration signals. As there is no clear model for the source in these searches, one needs to understand and reconstruct the system that produced the gravitational waves. Here we aim to reconstruct the source motion and masses of a system based only on its gravitational wave strain. We train a normalising flow on two models including circular orbits and random unphysical motion of two point masses. These models are used as a toy problem to illustrate the technique. We then reconstruct a distribution of possible motions of masses that can produce the given gravitational wave signal. We demonstrate the ability to reconstruct the full distribution of possible mass motions from strain data across multiple gravitational wave detectors. This distribution encompasses the degenerate motions that are expected to produce identical gravitational wave strains.</description>

      <title>The interaction between gravitational waves and a viscous fluid shell on a Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that the interaction between gravitational waves (GWs) and a shell of viscous matter leads to damping of the GWs and heating of the matter, and that these effects may be astrophysically significant. This result was derived using the theory of linear perturbations about a Minkowki background, and in this work the model is extended to be more physically realistic by allowing the background geometry to be Schwarzschild. It is found that the difference between using a Schwarzschild or Minkowski background is minimal when either $r\gg M$ or $\lambda&lt; M$, where $r$ is the radius of the shell, $\lambda$ is the GW wavelength and $M$ is the mass of the system in geometric units (so that $1M_\odot=1.48$km). However, when $r\sim 6M$ and $\lambda\sim 25M$, then the damping and heating effects are about 9 times larger on a Schwarzschild background than on Minkowski, and such situations occur astrophysically.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of black holes: relating the frequency domain to the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes is unstable under small perturbations (of order $\epsilon$) of the radial potential, while the early time-domain ringdown waveform is only marginally affected. In this paper we provide further insight into the apparent tension between the frequency-domain and the time-domain descriptions by analyzing the scattering properties of the problem. In the frequency domain, we study analytically the solutions corresponding to the perturbed potential. We show that there are two qualitatively different classes of instabilities, and that both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are affected by what we call a "Type II" instability, i.e., an exponential migration of the mode frequencies away from their unperturbed value as the perturbing "bump" moves away from the peak of the unperturbed potential. In the time domain, we elucidate the effect of the spectral instability in terms of the causal structure of the Green's function. By using an equivalent scattering problem we confirm analytically (and show numerically) that the deviation from the unperturbed waveform in the early ringdown stage is proportional to $\epsilon$ when $\epsilon\lesssim10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Instability of the Black Hole Ringdown Quasinormal Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of the quasinormal modes of the gravitational waves emitted during the ringdown phase following the merger of two black holes is of primary importance in gravitational astronomy. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing the predictions of the gravitational wave observables. We offer an analytical and intuitive explanation of such an instability and its properties based on the transfer matrix approach of quantum mechanics. We also give a simple interpretation of the fact that the prompt ringdown response in the time domain and the black hole greybody factor receive parametrically small corrections, thus being robust observables.</description>

      <title>$I$-Love-$Q$, and $\delta M$ too: The role of the mass in universal relations of compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of rotating neutron stars the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to the existence of various approximate, equation of state-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, the Love number and the quadrupole moment. These relations are relevant for observational astrophysics, since they allow (in theory) the inference of any two quantities within the $I$-Love-$Q$ triad out of the third one alone. However, the quantities involved in the relations are, in fact, normalized by a parameter $M_0$ that arises in the usual perturbative analytical approach as the mass of the background configuration. Since $M_0$ is not the mass of the rotating star $M_S$, it is not an observational quantity, which may affect the application of the relations to actual observations. This situation is usually ignored in most studies by taking $M_0$ to be the mass of the star, an approximation that can, in some cases, be inconsistent. In this paper we extract the value of $M_0$ using an $\textit{extended}$ version of the universal relations that involve a fourth parameter, $\delta M$, proportional to the difference $M_S-M_0$. We analyze to which degree this extended set of relations yields a more precise inference of compact star properties and equation of state parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08945v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey on-shell and off-shell higher derivative supergravities in dimensions $1\le D\le 11$. Various approaches to their construction, including the Noether procedure, (harmonic) superspace, superform method, superconformal tensor calculus, $S$-matrix and dimensional reduction, are summarized. Primarily the bosonic parts of the invariants and the supertransformations of the fermionic fields are provided. The process of going on-shell, solutions to the Killing spinor equations, typical supersymmetric solutions, and the role of duality symmetries in the context of $R^4, D^4 R^4$ and $D^6 R^4$ invariants are reviewed.</description>

      <title>The Time in Thermal Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing general relativity for quantization in the Hamiltonian approach leads to the `problem of time,' rendering the world fundamentally timeless. One proposed solution is the `thermal time hypothesis,' which defines time in terms of states representing systems in thermal equilibrium. On this view, time is supposed to emerge thermodynamically even in a fundamentally timeless context. Here, I develop the worry that the thermal time hypothesis requires dynamics -- and hence time -- to get off the ground, thereby running into worries of circularity.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Searching for String Bosenovas with Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of string bosenova explosions in vector superradiance clouds around spinning black holes, focusing on the observable consequences in gravitational wave detectors and accelerometers. During the growth of the superradiance cloud, the dark gauge field might reach a critical field strength, when a network of dark photon strings is produced via a superheated phase transition. These dark photon strings will then absorb the energy in the background fields and get ejected from the cloud, with total energy as large as the rotational energy of the black hole. In this paper, we study the subsequent evolution of this dense string network, and the resulting observational consequences depending on the unknown string tension, or almost equivalently, the ratio between the quartic and the gauge coupling in the Abelian Higgs model. Strings with large tension will dissipate into gravitational waves, detectable over a wide range of frequencies, from $\sim$ nHz near supermassive black holes, to $\gtrsim 10$ MHz around stellar mass black holes. This is the first known source of high frequency gravitational waves, unconstrained by cosmological observations. The strain of this gravitational wave can be larger than $10^{-14}$ at low frequencies, lasting for longer than typical duration of experiments. Small tension strings, with total lengths in the network as large as $10^{40}$ km, can travel to the earth with appreciable rate from any black hole in the Milky Way and interact with earth based accelerometers. If the Standard Model particles are directly charged under the dark photon, e.g. B-L, this interaction leads to an acceleration of Standard Model particles that is independent of the coupling constant. We work out the spectral density of this acceleration, and project that modern accelerometers and equivalence principle tests can be sensitive to the passing of these strings.</description>

      <title>Spinning Black Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$: Casimir Terms, Radial Action and Hidden Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve subtleties in calculating the post-Minksowskian dynamics of binary systems, as a spin expansion, from massive scattering amplitudes of fixed finite spin. In particular, the apparently ambiguous spin Casimir terms can be fully determined from the gradient of the spin-diagonal part of the amplitudes with respect to $S^2 = -s(s+1)\hbar^2$, using an interpolation between massive amplitudes with different spin representations. From two-loop amplitudes of spin-0 and spin-1 particles minimally coupled to gravity, we extract the spin Casimir terms in the conservative scattering angle between a spinless and a spinning black hole at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$, finding agreement with known results in the literature. This completes an earlier study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 (2023), 021601] that calculated the non-Casimir terms from amplitudes. We also illustrate our methods using a model of spinning bodies in electrodynamics, finding agreement between scattering amplitude predictions and classical predictions in a root-Kerr electromagnetic background up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^3 S^2)$. For both gravity and electrodynamics, the finite part of the amplitude coincides with the two-body radial action in the aligned spin limit, generalizing the amplitude-action relation beyond the spinless case. Surprisingly, the two-loop amplitude displays a hidden spin-shift symmetry in the probe limit, which was previously observed at one loop. We conjecture that the symmetry holds to all orders in the coupling constant and is a consequence of integrability of Kerr orbits in the probe limit at the first few orders in spin.</description>

      <title>Ultra-light dark matter with non-canonical kinetics reopening the mass window</title>

Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is viewed as a promising paradigm in understanding the structure formation of the local universe at small scales. Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM in return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale curiosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its implication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article, we propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound speed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the quantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of structure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper, while more possibilities remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Proving the absence of large one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation within the path-integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations $\zeta$ in an inflationary scenario containing a transient ultra-slow-roll (USR) period. In Ref.[1], it was argued that one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of $\zeta$ can be larger than the tree-level one within the parameter region generating the seeds of primordial black holes during the USR epoch, which implies the breakdown of perturbation theory. We prove that this is not the case by using a master formula for one-loop corrections to the power spectrum obtained in Ref.[2]. We derive the same formula within the path-integral formalism, which is simpler than the original derivation in [2]. To show the smallness of one-loop corrections, the consistency relations and the effective constancy of tree-level mode functions of $\zeta$ for super-Hubble modes play essential roles, with which the master formula gives a simple expression for one-loop corrections. For concreteness, we provide a reduced set of interactions including the leading-order one, while establishing the consistency relations in a self-consistent manner. We also show how the consistency relations of various operators hold explicitly, which plays a key role in proving the absence of large one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>Stability and topological nature of charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the thermodynamic characteristics and phase structures of a black hole, where the black hole horizon could be a hypersurface with positive, zero, or negative constant curvature, within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell theory, incorporating a negative cosmological constant and a Gauss-Bonnet correction. Our research follows the topological approach to black hole thermodynamics where we treat anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes as topological defects in thermodynamic space. We study the nature of the black hole's critical points and local stability by computing the winding numbers/topological charge associated with the zero point of the vector field, derived from the temperature of extremal points and generalized off-shell Gibbs free energy, respectively. Black holes are classified into different topological classes based on their topological number. In this study, we found unlike the charged AdS black hole, the charged GB AdS black hole exhibits a critical point. Our findings reveal the occurrence of a liquid/gas-like first-order phase transition between small-large black hole phases of the spherical charged GB AdS black hole. We conclude that the charged GB AdS and charged AdS black holes belong to different topological classes in the grand canonical ensemble. Furthermore, connecting with the previous studies, we conclude that the charged AdS and charged GB AdS black holes in canonical and charged GB in the grand canonical ensemble belong to the same topological classes.</description>

      <title>Analytic Primordial Power Spectrum in the Dressed Metric Approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology and Thermodynamics of Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectrum of cosmological tensor perturbations in the dressed metric approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. We compute the background-dependent effective mass that affects their propagation using the effective description of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that this mass can be approximated in different cosmological epochs by appropriate analytic functions. Moreover, in each of those epochs we can analytically solve the propagation of the perturbations, then obtaining the general solution globally by continuity requirements. On the other hand, since there are regimes far away from slow roll in the considered background evolution, the Bunch-Davies state does not provide a privileged choice of vacuum that would pick out a specific solution for the perturbations. Instead, we select the state of these perturbations by a recently proposed criterion that removes unwanted oscillations in the power spectrum. We compute the spectrum of this vacuum and compare it with other spectra obtained in the literature, especially with one corresponding to the hybrid approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. Finally, we notice that the same type of background dynamics is found in a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on thermodynamics, allowing in this case a free value for the tantamount of the critical density. Extending the dressed metric proposal to this phenomenological model, one might expect a similar form for the associated primordial power spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharply peaked quantum states are conjectured to be conducive to the notion of a quantum-corrected spacetime. We investigate this conjecture for a flat-FLRW model with perfect fluid, where a generalized ordering scheme is considered for the gravitational Hamiltonian. We study the implications of different ordering choices on the dynamics of the quantum universe. We demonstrate that the imprints of the operator ordering ambiguity are minimal, and quantum fluctuations are small in the case of sharply peaked states, leading to a consistent notion of a quantum-corrected spacetime defined via the expectation value of the scale factor. Surprisingly, the ordering imprints survive far away from the singularity through the quantum fluctuations in the quantum-corrected spacetime for broadly peaked states.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a novel study to obtain the initial spin of the primordial black holes created during a first-order phase transition due to delayed false vacuum decay. Remaining within the parameter space consistent with observational bounds, we express the abundance and the initial spin of the primordial black holes as functions of the phase transition parameters. The abundance of the primordial black holes is extremely sensitive to the phase transition parameters. We also find that the initial spin weakly depends on all parameters except the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Higher Memory Effects in Numerical Simulations of Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>

Abstract: Gravitational memory effects are predictions of general relativity that are characterized by an observable effect that persists after the passage of gravitational waves. In recent years, they have garnered particular interest, both due to their connection to asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems and because their observation would serve as a unique test of the nonlinear nature of general relativity. Apart from the more commonly known displacement and spin memories, however, there are other memory effects predicted by Einstein's equations that are associated with more subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion of the Bondi-Sachs metric. In this paper, we write explicit expressions for these higher memory effects in terms of their charge and flux contributions. Further, by using a numerical relativity simulation of a binary black hole merger, we compute the magnitude and morphology of these terms and compare them to those of the displacement and spin memory. We find that, although these terms are interesting from a theoretical perspective, due to their small magnitude they will be particularly challenging to observe with current and future detectors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Kerr-Sen black holes via R\'{e}nyi statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigate the topological properties of black holes in terms of R\'{e}nyi statistics as an extension of the Gibbs-Boltzmann (GB) statistics, aiming to characterize the non-Boltzmannian thermodynamic topology of Kerr-Sen and dyonic Kerr-Sen black holes. Through this research, we discover that the topological number derived via R\'{e}nyi statistics differs from that obtained through GB statistics. Interestingly, although the non-extended parameter $\lambda$ changes the topological number, the topological classification of the Kerr-Sen and dyonic Kerr-Sen black holes remains consistent under both GB and R\'{e}nyi statistics. In addition, the topological numbers associated with these two types of black holes without cosmological constant using R\'{e}nyi entropy processes are the same as the AdS cases of them by considering the GB entropy, as further evidenced by such a study found here. This indicates the cosmological constant has some potential connections the with the nonextensive R\'{e}nyi parameter from the perspective of thermodynamic topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the holographic dark energy model is constructed by using the non-extensive nature of the Schwarzschild black hole via the R\'enyi entropy. Due to the non-extensivity, the black hole can be stable under the process of fixing the non-extensive parameter. A change undergoing such a process would then motivate us to define the energy density of the R\'enyi holographic dark energy (RHDE). As a result, the RHDE with choosing the characteristic length scale as the Hubble radius provides the late-time expansion without the issue of causality. Remarkably, the proposed dark energy model contains the non-extensive length scale parameter additional to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The cosmic evolution can be characterized by comparing the size of the Universe to this length scale. Moreover, the preferable value of the non-extensive length scale is determined by fitting the model to recent observations. The results of this work would shed light on the interplay between the thermodynamic description of the black hole with non-extensivity and the classical gravity description of the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Persistent gravitational wave observables: Nonlinearities in (non-)geodesic deviation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual gravitational wave memory effect can be understood as a change in the separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of gravitational waves. Over the past few decades, a wide variety of other, "persistent" observables which measure permanent effects on idealized detectors have been introduced, each probing distinct physical effects. These observables can be defined in (regions of) any spacetime where there exists a notion of radiation, such as perturbation theory off of a fixed background, nonlinear plane wave spacetimes, or asymptotically flat spacetimes. Many of the persistent observables defined in the literature have only been considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes, and the perturbative nature of such calculations has occasionally obscured deeper relationships between these observables that hold more generally. The goal of this paper is to show how these more general results arise, and to do so we focus on two observables related to the separation between two, potentially accelerated observers. The first is the curve deviation, which is a natural generalization of the displacement memory, and also contains what this paper proposes to call drift memory (previously called "subleading displacement memory") and ballistic memory. The second is a relative proper time shift that arises between the two observers, either at second order in their initial separation and relative velocity, or in the presence of relative acceleration. The results of this paper are, where appropriate, entirely non-perturbative in the curvature of spacetime, and so could be used beyond leading order in asymptotically flat spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Final States in Quantum Cosmology: Cosmic Acceleration as a Quantum Post-Selection Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard quantum theory admits naturally statistical ensembles that are both pre-selected and post-selected, i.e., they involve both an initial and a final state. We argue that there is no compelling physical reason to preclude a probability assignment with a final quantum state at the cosmological level. We therefore analyze the implications of a final state in the probability assignment for quantum cosmology. To this end, we derive effective classical equations of motion for systems subject to both initial and final conditions. Remarkably, these effective equations do not depend on the details of the quantum theory, but only on the geometric features of the classical state space. When applied to Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, these effective equations generically describe cosmic acceleration in the absence of a cosmological constant, dark energy, or modified gravitational dynamics. Therefore, cosmic acceleration emerges as a quantum post-selection effect, that is, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Destroying the Event Horizon of Cold Dark Matter-Black Hole System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture was proposed, research on this conjecture has been ongoing. This paper explores the conjecture in black holes that are closer to those existing in the real universe (i.e., rotating black holes enveloped by dark matter). In this paper, we obtained a first-order corrected analytical solution for the black hole event horizon through an approximate solution. The validity of the first-order corrected analytical solution will be provided in the appendix. We conduct our study by introducing a test particle and a scalar field into the black hole. Our conclusions show that, in extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole; in near-extremal case, both a test particle and a scalar field can disrupt the event horizon of the Kerr-like black hole. When cold dark matter is not considered, the conclusion is consistent with previous research.</description>

      <title>Probing the Spin-Induced Quadrupole Moment of Massive Black Holes with the Inspiral of Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important sources for space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin and LISA, is the merger of massivie black hole binaries. By analyzing the inspiral signals, we can probe the characteristics of massive black holes, including the spin-induced multipole moments. By verifying the relation among mass, spin, and quadrupole moment, the no-hair theorem can be tested. In this work, we analyed the capability of probing the spin-induced quadrupole moment with the inspiral signal of massive black hole binaries using space-borne gravitational wave detectors. Using the Fisher information matrix, we find that the deviation of the quadrupole moment can be constrained to the level of $10^{-1}$, and events with higher mass ratios will provide a better constraint. We also find that the late inspiral part will dominate the result of parameter estimation. The results of Bayesian analysis indicate that the capability will be significantly enhanced by considering higher modes. We also calculate the Bayes factor, and the results indicate that the model of a black hole and a Boson star can be distinguished without a doubt.</description>

      <title>Glitch veto based on unphysical gravitational wave binary inspiral templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient signals arising from instrumental or environmental factors, commonly referred to as glitches, constitute the predominant background of false alarms in gravitational wave searches with ground-based detectors. Therefore, effective data analysis methods for vetoing glitch-induced false alarms are crucial to enhancing the sensitivity of a search. We present a veto method for glitches that impact matched filtering-based searches for binary inspiral signals. The veto uses unphysical sectors in the space of chirp time parameters as well as an unphysical extension including negative chirp times to efficiently segregate glitches from gravitational wave signals in data from a single detector. Inhabited predominantly by glitches but nearly depopulated of genuine gravitational wave signals, these unphysical sectors can be efficiently explored using Particle Swarm Optimization. In a test carried out on data taken from both LIGO detectors spanning multiple observation runs, the veto was able to reject $99.9\%$ of glitches with no loss of signals detected with signal-to-noise ratio $\geq 9.0$ and total detector frame mass $\leq 80$ $M_\odot$. Our results show that extending a matched filter search to unphysical parts of a signal parameter space promises to be an effective strategy for mitigating glitches.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the singularity-free $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity via Raychaudhuri equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bounce cosmology to construct a singularity-free $f(\mathcal{R})$ model using the reconstruction technique. The formulation of the $f(\mathcal{R})$ model is based on the Raychaudhari equation, a key element employed in reconstructed models to eliminate singularities. We explore the feasibility of obtaining stable gravitational Lagrangians, adhering to the conditions $f_{\mathcal{R}}&gt;0$ and $f_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}&gt;0$. Consequently, both models demonstrate stability, effectively avoiding the Dolgov-Kawasaki instability. Our assessment extends to testing the reconstructed model using energy conditions and the effective equation-of-state (EoS). Our findings indicate that the reconstructed super-bounce model facilitates the examination of a singularity-free accelerating universe for both phantom and non-phantom phases. However, in the case of the reconstructed oscillatory bounce model, two scenarios are considered with $\omega=-1/3$ and $\omega=-2/3$. While the model proves suitable for studying a singular-free accelerating universe in the $\omega=-1/3$ case, it fails to demonstrate such behavior under energy conditions for the $\omega=-2/3$ scenario. The reconstructed models accommodate early-time bouncing behavior and late-</description>

      <title>On black bounce space-times in non-linear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main issues in gravitation is the presence of singularities in the most common space-time solutions of General Relativity, as the case of black holes. A way of constructing regular solutions that remove spacelike singularities consists in implement a bounce on such space-time, leading to what is usually known as black bounce space-times. Such space-times are known to describe regular black holes or traversable wormholes. However, one of the main issues lies on reconstructing the appropriate source that leads to such a solution. In this paper, a reconstruction method is implemented to show that such types of metrics can be well accommodated in non-linear electrodynamics with the presence of a scalar field. Some of the most important black bounces solutions are reconstructed in this framework, both in 3+1 as in 2+1 dimensions. For the first time in the literature, these solutions have an electrically charged source of matter from non-linear electrodynamics. Specific features are indicated that distinguish electric sources from magnetic ones, previously found for the same space-times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric configurations of the quadratic $f(R)$ gravity in the Einstein frame. In case of a purely gravitational system, we have determined the global qualitative behavior of the metric and the scalaron field for all static solutions satisfying the conditions of asymptotic flatness. These solutions are proved to be regular everywhere except for a naked singularity at the center; they are uniquely determined by the total mass $\mathfrak{M}$ and the "scalar charge" $Q$ characterizing the strength of the scalaron field at spatial infinity. The case $Q=0$ yields the Schwarzschild solution, but an arbitrarily small $Q\ne 0$ leads to the appearance of a central naked singularity having a significant effect on the neighboring region, even when the space-time metric in the outer region is practically insensitive to the scalaron field. Approximation procedures are developed to derive asymptotic relations near the naked singularity and at spatial infinity, and the leading terms of the solutions are presented. We investigate the linear stability of the static solutions with respect to radial perturbations satisfying the null Dirichlet boundary condition at the center and numerically estimate the range of parameters corresponding to stable/unstable configurations. In particular, the configurations with sufficiently small $Q$ turn out to be linearly unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several high-accuracy surrogate models for gravitational-wave signals from equal-mass head-on mergers of Proca stars, computed through the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$. We also discuss the current state of the model extensions to mergers of Proca stars with different masses, and the particular challenges that these present. The models are divided in two main categories: two-stage and monolithic. In the two-stage models, a dimensional reduction algorithm is applied to embed the data in a reduced feature space, which is then interpolated in terms of the physical parameters. For the monolithic models, a single neural network is trained to predict the waveform from the input physical parameter. Our model displays mismatches below $10^{-3}$ with respect to the original numerical waveforms. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our model in full Bayesian parameter inference through the accurate recovery of numerical relativity signals injected in zero-noise, together with the analysis of GW190521. For the latter, we observe excellent agreement with existing results that make use of full numerical relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a novel approach based on physics-informed neural networks to the computation of quasinormal modes of black hole solutions in modified gravity. In particular, we focus on the case of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, with several choices of the coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. This type of calculation introduces a number of challenges with respect to the case of General Relativity, mainly due to the extra complexity of the perturbation equations and to the fact that the background solution is known only numerically. The solution of these perturbation equations typically requires sophisticated numerical techniques that are not easy to develop in computational codes. We show that physics-informed neural networks have an accuracy which is comparable to traditional numerical methods in the case of numerical backgrounds, while being very simple to implement. Additionally, the use of GPU parallelization is straightforward thanks to the use of standard machine learning environments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the measurement correlation between the effective spin and the effective tidal deformability in gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers. To efficiently measure the effective tidal deformability parameter, we exploit the fact that the tidal effects in a binary system are prominent when the components are closer during the late-inspiral. Thus, we indicate to a computationally efficient strategy of extracting the tidal information compressed within seconds before the merger. We report our observations for \texttt{GW170817} and explore the suitability of our approach in the upcoming observation scenarios of the current and the future ground-based observatories. Fast and accurate measurements of the tidal deformability parameters can be used to inform astronomers in prioritizing the electromagnetic follow-up efforts for such sources.</description>

      <title>Kramer's Escape Rate and Phase Transition Dynamics in AdS Black Holes with Dark Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional static methods in phase transition studies, such as the swallowtail bifurcation diagram, provide good insights into the thermodynamics of black holes. However, they practically lose sight of the dynamic aspects and temporal sequence of events. The Kramers escape rate, central to our research, offers a somewhat dynamic approach to phase transition. We examine the free energy landscapes for black holes under the influence of â€™darkâ€™ and â€™stringy+darkâ€™ structures, assessing how additional parameters affect the escape rates and dynamics of the transition during the first-order phase transition from small to large black holes. In our analysis, we consider the escape rate as a function of the black hole radius and study its variations. We will observe that, on one hand, the escape rate well represents our assumption based on the movement from zero, increasing to a maximum point, and then decreasing back to zero as reactive structures become active during the phase transition interval. However, the critical point in this method is the encounter with a specific and distinct point. This is where the diagram of the direct process (escape rate from small to large black holes) intersects with the reverse process (large to small black holes), becoming equally probable (contact point). The point, which seems improbable at the onset of the phase transition or very negligible, gains more significance as the process progresses. This increase indicates the dominance of a region where the escape rate from larger black holes to smaller ones prevails. The predominance of the reverse process, which increases as we approach the end of the process and is necessarily accompanied by a variation in radius, may be considered as a natural reaction of the black hole against the â€™phase changeâ€™ action. A reaction which attempting to prevent any uncontrolled radial growth that could jeopardize the stability of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Driven Inspirals of Binaries Connected by Cosmic Strings</title>

Abstract: We consider gravitational waves from a pair of monopoles or black holes that are moving non-relativistically and are connected by a cosmic string. Shortly after the binary's formation, the connecting string straightens due the direct coupling of its motion to gravitational radiation. Afterwards, the motion of the binary can be well-approximated by a non-relativistic motion of its components that have an additional constant mutual attraction force due to the tension of the straight string that connects them. The orbit shrinks due to the gravitational radiation backreacting on the binary's components. We find that if the binary's semimajor axis $a\gg \sqrt{R_1 R_2/{\mu}}$, its eccentricity grows on the inspiral's timescale; here $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the gravitational radii of the binary components, and $\mu$ is the dimensionless tension of the string. When the eccentricity is high, it approaches unity super-exponentially. If the binary's components are monopole-antimonopole pair, this leads to the physical collision that would likely destroy the string and annihilate the monopoles when the semimajor axis is still many orders of magnitude greater than the string thickness. If the binary's components are black holes, then the eccentricity reaches its peak when $a\sim \sqrt{R_1 R_2/\mu}$, and then decays according to the standard Peter's formula. The black-hole spins initially become locked to the orbital motion, but then lag behind as the inspiral proceeds. We estimate the string-tension-induced dimensionless spins just prior to the merger and find them to be $\sim\mu^{3/8}\ll 1$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>

Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance can be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with a second-generation TDI null stream $C^{12}_3$. The combined three data streams, including two science observables from the hybrid Relay and $C^{12}_3$, could reduce the instabilities of noise spectra in the targeting frequency band and form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>Accretion of the degenerate Fermi gas onto a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stationary, spherically symmetric accretion of a degenerate relativistic Fermi gas onto a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. The accretion theory is based on the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and the Fermi gas follows Fermi-Dirac statistics at infinity. We have derived the expression for the particle current density, the stress energy-momentum tensor, and three accretion rates. As the charged particle falls into the black hole, both the mass and the charge of the black hole increase. Consequently, the mass accretion rate and charge accretion rate are proportional to the particle accretion rate. We have also provided analytical results at infinity and numerical results within a finite range for these quantities. Our results indicate that the accretion rate decreases as the charge of the black hole increases, suggests that the presence of naked singularities is avoided in black hole accretion theory. In this paper, we also discovered that the accretion model of Vlasov gas behaves as an anisotropic fluid containing two perfect-fluid components. One component represents the isotropic fluid of Fermi gas, while the other represents a null fluid. When using the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system, we observed that the contribution from the null fluid persists even at infinity, which led to the radial pressure always smaller than the tangential pressure. Therefore, it's not appropriate to treat the accretion model as a perfect fluid at infinity.</description>

Abstract: We describe quantization schemes for scalar field cosmology in the metric variables with fundamental discreteness imposed with a lattice. The variables chosen for quantization determine the lattice, and each lattice produces distinct effective equations derived from semiclassical states. We show that requiring a bounce at the Planck density uniquely selects the volume lattice and gives the same effective Friedmann equation as that obtained in loop quantum cosmology. We also present conditions for the validity of the effective equations.</description>

      <title>A parametrized quasi-normal mode framework for modified Teukolsky equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modifications to general relativity lead to effects in the spectrum of quasi-normal modes of black holes. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism to describe deviations from general relativity in the Teukolsky equation, which governs linear perturbations of spinning black holes. We do this by introducing a correction to the effective potential of the Teukolsky equation in the form of a $1/r$ expansion controlled by free parameters. The method assumes that a small deviation in the effective potential induces a small modification in the spectrum of modes and in the angular separation constants. We isolate and compute the universal linear contribution to the quasi-normal mode frequencies and separation constants in a set of coefficients, and test them against known examples in the literature (massive scalar field, Dudley-Finley equation and higher-derivative gravity). We make the coefficients publicly available for relevant overtone, angular momentum and azimuthal numbers of modes and different values of the black hole spin.</description>

Abstract: Deploying \textit{multiple sharp transitions} (MSTs) under a unified framework, we investigate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and the production of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) by incorporating one-loop corrected renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum. With effective sound speed parameter, $1 \leq c_s \leq 1.17$, the direct consequence is the generation of PBH masses spanning $M_{\rm PBH}\sim{\cal O}(10^{-31}M_{\odot}- 10^{4}M_{\odot})$, thus evading well known \textit{No-go theorem} on PBH mass. Our results align coherently with the extensive NANOGrav 15-year data and the sensitivities outlined by other terrestrial and space-based experiments (e.g.: LISA, HLVK, BBO, HLV(O3), etc.).</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity as a saviour for PBH overproduction in SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays for Galileon inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the explicit role of negative local non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, in suppressing the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the single-field model of Galileon inflation. PBH formation requires significantly enhancing the scalar power spectrum, which greatly affects their abundance. The associated frequencies in the nHz regime are also sensitive to the generation of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) which may explain the current data from the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Our analysis using the threshold statistics on the compaction function demonstrates that Galileon theory not only avoids PBH overproduction using the curvature perturbation enhancements that give $f_{\rm NL} \sim {\cal O}(-6)$, but also generates SIGWs that conform well with the PTA data.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Annihilation and Pair-Instability Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of heavy stars ($M\ge40{\rm M}_\odot$) undergoing pair-instability in the presence of annihilating dark matter. Focusing on the scenario where the dark matter is in capture-annihilation equilibrium, we model the profile of energy injections in the local thermal equilibrium approximation. We find that significant changes to masses of astrophysical black holes formed by (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae can occur when the ambient dark matter density $ \rho_{\rm DM} \gtrsim10^9 \rm \, GeV \, cm^{-3}$. There are two distinct outcomes, depending on the dark matter mass. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim1$ GeV the DM is primarily confined to the core. The annihilation increases the lifetime of core helium burning, resulting in more oxygen being formed, fueling a more violent explosion during the pair-instability-induced contraction. This drives stronger pulsations, leading to lighter black holes being formed than predicted by the standard model. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\lesssim0.5$ GeV there is significant dark matter in the envelope, leading to a phase where the star is supported by the energy from the annihilation. This reduces the core temperature and density, allowing the star to evade the pair-instability allowing heavier black holes to be formed. We find a mass gap for all models studied.</description>

Abstract: Adopting general frameworks for quantum-classical dynamics, we analyze the interaction between quantum matter and a classical gravitational field. We point out that, assuming conservation of momentum or energy, and assuming that the dynamics obeys Hamiltonian formalism or a particular decomposition property set out in the paper, the classical gravitational field cannot change the momentum or energy of the quantum system, whereas the quantum gravitational field can do so. Drawing upon the fundamental relationship between conservation laws and the quantum properties of objects, our analysis offers new perspectives for the study of quantum gravity and provides a novel interpretation of existing experimental observations, such as free fall.</description>

      <title>A model-independent tripartite test of cosmic distance relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological distances are fundamental observables in cosmology. The luminosity ($D_L$), angular diameter ($D_A$) and gravitational wave ($D_{\rm GW}$) distances are all trivially related in General Relativity assuming no significant absorption of photons in the extragalactic medium, also known as cosmic opacity. Supernovae have long been the main cosmological standard candle, but bright standard sirens are now a proven alternative, with the advantage of not requiring calibration with other astrophysical sources. Moreover, they can also measure deviations from modified gravity through discrepancies between $D_L$ and $D_{\rm GW}$. However, both gravitational and cosmological parameters are degenerate in the Hubble diagram, making it hard to properly detect beyond standard model physics. Finally, recently a model-independent method named FreePower was proposed to infer angular diameter distances from large-scale structure which is independent of the knowledge of both early universe and dark energy physics. In this paper we propose a tripartite test of the ratios of these three distances with minimal amount of assumptions regarding cosmology, the early universe, cosmic opacity and modified gravity. We proceed to forecast this test with a combination of LSST and Roman supernovae, Einstein Telescope bright sirens and a joint DESI-like + Euclid-like galaxy survey. We find that even in this very model-independent approach we will be able to detect, in each of many redshift bins, percent-level deviations in these ratios of distances, allowing for very precise consistency checks of $\Lambda$CDM and standard physics. It can also result in sub-percent measurements of $H_0$.</description>

Abstract: Field transformations for the quantum effective action lead to different pictures of a given physical situation, as describing a given evolution of the universe by different geometries. Field transformations for functional flow equations can reveal important physical features, as the appearance of bound states. They also allow for technical simplifications. We make a critical assessment of the virtues and shortcomings of different versions of field transformations. Key issues are demonstrated by the quantum field theory for scalars with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term. Our findings confirm the principle of field relativity for gravity and cosmology based on the quantum effective action.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers of rotating charged AdS black holes in both four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravity theories. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of the thermodynamical topological approach to black holes, utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy. We demonstrate that the number of rotation parameters plays a significant role in determining the topological numbers of five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes. Moreover, our findings indicate that the topological numbers of both four- and five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes are not influenced by the number of electric charge parameters. This highlights a distinct difference in how rotation and electric charge parameters impact the thermodynamic topological properties of these black holes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Time Delay Interferometry Ranging as a Practical Ranging Approach in the Bayesian Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is an indispensable step in the whole data processing procedure of space-based gravitational wave detection, as it mitigates the overwhelming laser frequency noise, which would otherwise completely bury the gravitational wave signals. Knowledge on the inter-spacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of TDI. Conventional method for inter-spacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudo-random noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information, it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as cross-validations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative data-driven approach - time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR) - as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research, our TDIR algorithm significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem and employing a general polynomial parametrization, we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises, the estimated median values of delays are only 5.28 ns away from the ground truths, capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Additionally, we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR, and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.</description>

      <title>Heavy States in 3d Gravity and 2d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss correlators of light fields in heavy states in 3d gravity and holographic 2d CFTs. In the bulk, the propagator of free fields in AdS backgrounds containing a conical defect or a BTZ black hole can be obtained by solving the wave equation, as well as by the method of images. On the boundary, these geometries are sourced by heavy operator insertions, and the propagator is dual to a heavy-light (HHLL) correlator. By matching its expansion in Virasoro blocks to our bulk results, we determine the OPE coefficients of all contributing states in both the s and t channels. In the s channel, these states are excitations of the light field on top of the heavy state, and their OPE coefficients are the amplitudes to create them. The t-channel OPE is dominated by the Virasoro vacuum block, but there is also an infinite family of light two-particle states that contribute to the correlator. The OPE coefficients that couple these states to heavy operators represent their expectation values in heavy backgrounds. We determine them exactly, derive their asymptotic form at large twist, and discuss their behavior near and above the BTZ threshold, where they become thermal one-point functions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a $2.5\text{-}4.5~M_\odot$ Compact Object and a Neutron Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a coalescing compact binary with component masses $2.5\text{-}4.5~M_\odot$ and $1.2\text{-}2.0~M_\odot$ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network on 2023 May 29 by the LIGO Livingston Observatory. The primary component of the source has a mass less than $5~M_\odot$ at 99% credibility. We cannot definitively determine from gravitational-wave data alone whether either component of the source is a neutron star or a black hole. However, given existing estimates of the maximum neutron star mass, we find the most probable interpretation of the source to be the coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole that has a mass between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes observed in the Galaxy. We provisionally estimate a merger rate density of $55^{+127}_{-47}~\text{Gpc}^{-3}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to the source of GW230529_181500; assuming that the source is a neutron star-black hole merger, GW230529_181500-like sources constitute about 60% of the total merger rate inferred for neutron star-black hole coalescences. The discovery of this system implies an increase in the expected rate of neutron star-black hole mergers with electromagnetic counterparts and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the purported lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>The expected kinematic matter dipole is robust against source evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements using catalogues of quasars and radio galaxies have shown that the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is about twice as large as is expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, indeed in any cosmology based on the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. This expectation is based on the kinematic interpretation of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, i.e. as arising due to our local peculiar velocity. The effect of aberration and Doppler boosting on the projected number counts on the sky of cosmologically distant objects in a flux-limited catalogue can then be calculated and confronted with observations. This fundamental consistency test of FLRW models proposed by Ellis &amp; Baldwin (1984) was revisited by Dalang &amp; Bonvin (2022) [arXiv:2111.03616] who argued that redshift evolution of the sources can significantly affect the expected matter dipole. In this note we demonstrate that the Ellis &amp; Baldwin test is in fact robust to such effects, hence the &gt; 5$\sigma$ dipole anomaly uncovered by Secrest et al. (2021, 2022) [arXiv:2009.14826, arXiv:2206.05624] remains an outstanding challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the perturbative stability of Euclidean axion wormholes. The quadratic action that governs linear perturbations is derived directly in Euclidean gravity. We demonstrate explicitly that a stability analysis in which one treats the axion as a normal two-form gauge field is equivalent to one performed in the Hodge-dual formulation, where one considers the axion as a scalar with a wrong-sign kinetic term. Both analyses indicate that axion wormholes are perturbatively stable, even in the presence of a massless dilaton, or saxion, field that couples to the axion.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of topological black hole in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to include the effect of high energy and topological parameters on black holes in $F(R)$ gravity, we consider two corrections to this gravity: energy-dependent spacetime with different topological constants, and a nonlinear electrodynamics field. In other words, we combine $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics theory to see the effects of high energy and topological parameters on the physics of black holes. For this purpose, we first extract topological black hole solutions in $F(R)$% -ModMax gravity's rainbow. Then, by considering black holes as thermodynamic systems, we obtain thermodynamic quantities and check the first law of thermodynamics. The effect of the topological parameter on the Hawking temperature and the total mass of black holes is obvious. We also discuss the thermodynamic topology of topological black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow using the off-shell free energy method. In this formalism, black holes are assumed to be equivalent to defects in their thermodynamic spaces. For our analysis, we consider two different types of thermodynamic ensembles. These are: fixed $q$ ensemble and fixed $\phi$ ensemble. We take into account all the different types of curvature hypersurfaces that can be constructed in these black holes. The local and global topology of these black holes are studied by computing the topological charges at the defects in their thermodynamic spaces. Finally, in accordance with their topological charges, we classify the black holes into three topological classes with total winding numbers corresponding to $-1, 0$, and $1$. We observe that the topological classes of these black holes are dependent on the value of the rainbow function, the sign of the scalar curvature, and the choice of ensembles.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

      <title>Fragmention in Gravitationally-Unstable Collapsar Disks and Sub-Solar Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although stable neutron stars (NS) can in principle exist down to masses Mns ~ 0.1Msun, standard models of stellar core-collapse predict a robust lower limit Mns &gt;~ 1.2Msun, roughly commensurate with the Chandrasekhar mass Mch of the progenitor's iron core (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.5). However, this limit may be circumvented in sufficiently dense neutron-rich environments (Ye &lt;&lt; 0.5) for which Mch ~ Ye^2 is reduced to &lt; Msun. Such physical conditions could arise in the black hole accretion disks formed from the collapse of rapidly-rotating stars ("collapsars"), as a result of gravitational instabilities and cooling-induced fragmentation, similar to models for planet formation in protostellar disks. We confirm that the conditions to form sub-solar mass NS (ssNS) may be marginally satisfied in the outer regions of massive neutrino-cooled collapsar disks. If the disk fragments into multiple ssNS, their subsequent coalescence offers a channel for precipitating sub-solar mass LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave mergers that does not implicate primordial black holes. The model makes several additional predictions: (1) ~Hz frequency Doppler modulation of the ssNS-merger gravitational wave signals due to the binary's orbital motion in the disk; (2) at least one additional gravitational wave event (coincident within &lt;~ hours), from the coalescence of the ssNS-merger remnant(s) with the central black hole; (3) an associated gamma-ray burst and supernova counterpart, the latter boosted in energy and enriched with r-process elements from the NS merger(s) embedded within the exploding stellar envelope ("kilonovae inside a supernova").</description>

      <title>Isospectrality in Effective Field Theory Extensions of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two universal predictions of general relativity are the propagation of gravitational waves of large momentum along null geodesics and the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in many families of black holes. In extensions of general relativity, these properties are typically lost: quasinormal modes are no longer isospectral and gravitational wave propagation is no longer geodesic and it exhibits birefringence -- polarization-dependent speed. We study these effects in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with up to eight-derivative terms and show that there is a unique Lagrangian that has a non-birefringent dispersion relation for gravitational waves and isospectral quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit. We argue that both properties are related through a generalized correspondence between eikonal quasinormal modes and unstable photon-sphere orbits. These properties define a special class of theories that we denote as isospectral effective field theories. We note that the lowest-order isospectral correction to general relativity coincides with the quartic-curvature correction arising from type II string theory, suggesting that isospectrality might be a key feature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the action principle for the holographic $T\bar{T}$-deformation. We develop a scheme in which one can holographically reproduce the action of the Liouville theory deformed by $T\bar{T}$-insertion. This scheme necessitates considering the bending energy of the finite cut-off surface. Following our proposal, one observes a perfect match between the actions of deformed theory on the field theory and gravity sides.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic assessment of dark energy after DESI DR1 BAO</title>

Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Data Release 1) have revealed exciting results that show evidence for dynamical dark energy at $\sim3\sigma$ when combined with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernova observations. These measurements are based on the $w_0w_a$CDM model of dark energy. The evidence is less in other dark energy models such as the $w$CDM model. To avoid imposing a dark energy model, we reconstruct the distance measures and the equation of the state of dark energy independent of any dark energy model and driven only by observational data. To this end, we use both single-task and multi-task Gaussian Process regression. Our results show that the model-agnostic evidence for dynamical dark energy is much less than the evidence from DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our analysis also provides model-independent constraints on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the matter-energy density parameter at present. We find that the reconstructed values of these parameters are not consistent with the results reported in DESI with the $w_0w_a$CDM model. However, they are almost consistent with DESI for the $w$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Communicating the gravitational-wave discoveries of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has made breakthrough discoveries in gravitational-wave astronomy, a new field of astronomy that provides a different means of observing our Universe. Gravitational-wave discoveries are possible thanks to the work of thousands of people from across the globe working together. In this article, we discuss the range of engagement activities used to communicate LVK gravitational-wave discoveries and the stories of the people behind the science using the activities surrounding the release of the third Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog as a case study.</description>
