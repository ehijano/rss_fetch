      <title>Which Rope Breaks? A Study of Tension Distribution in Multi-Rope Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tension distribution in systems of mass-less ropes under different loading conditions. For a two-rope system, we demonstrate how the breaking scenario depends on the applied force dynamics: rapid pulling causes the lower rope to break, while gradual pulling leads to upper rope failure. Extending to a three-rope Y-shaped configuration, we identify a critical angle theta_C=60{\deg} that determines which rope breaks first. When the angle between the upper ropes exceeds this critical value, the upper ropes fail before the lower one. We further analyze how an attached mass at the junction point modifies this critical angle and establish maximum mass limits for valid solutions. Our results provide practical insights for introductory physics students understanding static forces and system stabilities.</description>

      <title>Helical Field-Driven Translational-Rotational Conversion in Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of a new magnetodynamic effect describing the energy exchange between the degrees of freedom of a conducting cylinder moving in a helical magnetic field has been developed. The possibility of effectively converting the translational motion of the cylinder into its angular rotation around the system axis (translational-rotational conversion, TRC) has been demonstrated. A connection between this effect and the formation of helical trajectories of electrons in undulators in free electron lasers (FELs) and the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) has been revealed. In TRC, unlike many known effects associated with the interaction of a moving conductor with a magnetic field, the conductor has no electrical contact with any external circuit, which makes it especially attractive for various applications. The TRC is also possible in a magnetohydrodynamic flow moving along the axis of a helical magnetic field. The theory is formulated in the limit of large magnetic Reynolds numbers, which corresponds to a sufficiently fast motion of well-conducting objects. In this scenario, the dynamics of the system is described by a nonlinear pendulum equation or a nonlinear pendulum equation with a nonzero right-hand side. In the latter case, a system dynamic mode corresponding to phase lock can be implemented.</description>

      <title>Near-Hamiltonian dynamics and energy-like quantities of next-generation neural mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural mass models describe the mean-field dynamics of populations of neurons. In this work we illustrate how fundamental ideas of physics, such as energy and conserved quantities, can be explored for such models. We show that time-rescaling renders recent next-generation neural mass models Hamiltonian in the limit of a homogeneous population or strong coupling. The corresponding energy-like quantity provides considerable insight into the model dynamics even in the case of heterogeneity, and explain for example why orbits are near-ellipsoidal and predict spike amplitude during bursting dynamics. We illustrate how these energy considerations provide a possible link between neuronal population behavior and energy landscape theory, which has been used to analyze data from brain recordings. Our introduction of near-Hamiltonian descriptions of neuronal activity could permit the application of highly developed physics theory to get insight into brain behavior.</description>
