      <title>John Ellipsoids of Revolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a largest Euclidean ball in a given convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and finding the largest volume ellipsoid in $K$ are two problems of very different nature. The first is a Euclidean problem, where similar copies of the origin centered closed unit ball are considered, whereas in the second, we search among affine copies of $\mathbf{B}^{d}$. In this paper, we interpolate between the two problems by considering ellipsoids of revolution. We generalize the problem by looking at pairs of convex bodies $K$ and $L$ and the largest volume affine image of $K$ contained in $L$, where we make certain restrictions on the affine transformation.</description>

      <title>On the Gromov--Hausdorff stability of metric viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the stability of metric viscosity solutions to first-order Hamilton--Jacobi equations under Gromov--Hausdorff convergence. Our proof combines a characterization of metric viscosity solutions via quadratic distance functions with a doubling variable method adapted to epsilon-isometries, which allows us to pass to the Gromov--Hausdorff limit without embedding the spaces into a common ambient space. As a byproduct, we give a PDE-based proof of the stability of the dual Kantorovich problems under measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Approximation by uniformly distributed sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider approximation properties of real points by uniformly distributed sequences. Under some assumptions on the approximation functions, we prove a Khintchine-type $0$-$1$ dichotomy law. We establish a new connection between uniform distribution and the ubiquity property. Namely, we show that a bound on the discrepancy of the sequence implies the ubiquity property, which helps to obtain divergence results. We further obtain Hausdorff dimension results for weighted sets. The key tools in proving these results are the weighted ubiquitous systems and weighted mass transference principle introduced recently by Kleinbock \&amp; Wang, and Wang \&amp; Wu respectively.</description>

      <title>Gr\"unbaum's inequality for probability measures with concavity properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06759v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result in convex geometry is Gr\"unbaum's inequality, which quantifies how much volume of a convex body can be cut off by a hyperplane passing through its barycenter. In this work, we establish a series of sharp Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities - with equality characterizations - for probability measures under certain concavity assumptions. Of particular interest is the case of $s$-concave Radon measures. For such measures, we provide a simpler proof of known results and, more importantly, obtain the previously missing equality characterization. This is achieved by gaining new insight into the equality case of their Brunn-Minkowski-type inequality.
  Moreover, we show that these ``$s$-Gr\"unbaum'' inequalities can hold only when $s &gt; -1$. However, for convex measures on the real line, we prove Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities involving their cumulative distribution function. Finally, by applying the renowned Ehrhard inequality, we deduce an ``Ehrhard-Gr\"unbaum'' inequality for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which improves upon the bound derived from its log-concavity.</description>

      <title>A Lorentzian splitting theorem for continuously differentiable metrics and weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a splitting theorem for globally hyperbolic, weighted spacetimes with metrics and weights of regularity $C^1$ by combining elliptic techniques for the negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator from our recent work in the smooth setting with the concept of line-adapted curves introduced here. Our results extend the Lorentzian splitting theorem proved for smooth globally hyperbolic spacetimes by Galloway -- and variants of its weighted counterparts by Case and Woolgar--Wylie -- to this low regularity setting.</description>

      <title>Surjectivity of the Cannon--Thurston map in metric (graph) bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric (graph) bundles generalize the notion of fiber bundles to the context of geometric group theory and were introduced by Mj and Sardar. Suppose $X$ is a metric (graph) bundle over $B$ such that the fibers are (uniformly) hyperbolic, and the total space $X$ is also hyperbolic. In this generality, Mj--Sardar proved that the inclusion of a fiber into $X$ admits a continuous extension to the (Gromov) boundary.
  In this article, we prove that such a continuous extension map between boundaries is surjective in the following two key settings.
  $(1)$ The fibers are uniformly quasiisometric to a nonelementary hyperbolic group.
  $(2)$ The fibers are one-ended hyperbolic metric spaces.
  Our result generalizes a theorem of Bowditch in which the fibers were assumed to be the hyperbolic plane, and it answers a question posed by Lazarovich, Margolis and Mj.</description>

      <title>Interpolating with generalized Assouad dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\phi$-Assouad dimensions are a family of dimensions which interpolate between the upper box and Assouad dimensions. They are a generalization of the well-studied Assouad spectrum with a more general form of scale sensitivity that is often closely related to "phase-transition" phenomena in sets.
  In this article we establish a number of key properties of the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions which help to clarify their behaviour. We prove for any bounded doubling metric space $F$ and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\overline{\operatorname{dim}}_{\mathrm{B}}F&lt;\alpha\leq\operatorname{dim}_{\mathrm{A}} F$ that there is a function $\phi$ so that the $\phi$-Assouad dimension of $F$ is equal to $\alpha$. We further show that the "upper" variant of the dimension is fully determined by the $\phi$-Assouad dimension, and that homogeneous Moran sets are in a certain sense generic for these dimensions.
  Further, we study explicit examples of sets where the Assouad spectrum does not reach the Assouad dimension. We prove a precise formula for the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions for Galton--Watson trees that correspond to a general class of stochastically self-similar sets, including Mandelbrot percolation. This result follows from two results which may be of general interest: a sharp large deviations theorem for Galton--Watson processes with bounded offspring distribution, and a Borel--Cantelli-type lemma for infinite structures in random trees. Finally, we obtain results on the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions of overlapping self-similar sets and decreasing sequences with decreasing gaps.</description>

      <title>An overview of the stability of Sobolev inequalities on Riemannian manifolds with Ricci lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent results regarding the problem of the stability of Sobolev inequalities on Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature lower bounds. We shall describe techniques and methods from smooth and non-smooth geometry, the fruitful combination of which revealed particularly effective. Furthermore, we present a self-contained overview of the proof of the stability of the Sobolev inequality on manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, adopting a direct strategy tailored to this setting. Finally, we discuss related stability results and present some open problems.</description>

      <title>Mixing and Merging Metric Spaces using Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X_1,d_1),\dots, (X_N,d_N)$ be metric spaces, where $d_i: X_i \times X_i \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a distance function for $i=1,\dots,N$. Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the set theoretic product $X_1\times \cdots \times X_N$. Let $\mathcal{G} = \left(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\right)$ be a directed graph with vertex set $\mathcal{V} =\{1,\dots, N\}$, and let $\mathcal{P} = \{p_{ij}\}$ be a collection of weights, where each $p_{ij}\in (0, 1]$ is associated with the edge $(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}$. We introduce the function $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}: \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]$ defined by \begin{align*} d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}) := \left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \prod_{i=1}^N \left[1- d_i(g_i,h_i)\right]^{\frac{1}{p_{ji}}} \right), \end{align*} for all $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h} \in \mathcal{X}$. In this paper we show that $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defines a metric space over $\mathcal{X}$. Then we determine how this distance behaves under various graph operations, including disjoint unions and Cartesian products. We investigate two limiting cases: (a) when $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ is defined over a finite field, leading to a broad generalization of graph-based distances commonly studied in error-correcting code theory; and (b) when the metric is extended to graphons, enabling the measurement of distances in a continuous graph limit setting.</description>
