      <title>Anomalous sub-kelvin thermal frequency shifts of ultra narrow-linewidth solid state emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the frequency response of narrow spectral holes in a doped crystal structure as a function of temperature below 1 K. We identify a particular regime in which this response significantly deviates from the expected two-phonon Raman scattering theory. Namely, near 290 mK, we observed a behaviour exhibiting a temperature-dependent frequency shift of zero, to first-order. This is of particular interest for applications which require high frequency-stability, such as laser frequency stabilization, as by operating the scheme at this specific point would result in the spectral hole frequency being highly immune to temperature fluctuations, providing the potential for a laser fractional frequency instability as low as $\mathrm{\sim6\times10^{-22}}$ at 1 s.</description>

      <title>Universal on-chip polarization handling with deep photonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel design paradigm for arbitrarily capable deep photonic networks of cascaded Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs) for on-chip universal polarization handling. Using a device architecture made of cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we modify and train the phase difference between interferometer arms for both polarizations through wide operation bandwidths. Three proof-of-concept polarization handling devices are illustrated using a software-defined, physics-informed neural framework, to achieve user-specified target device responses as functions of polarization and wavelength. These devices include a polarization splitter, a polarization-independent power splitter, and an arbitrary polarization-dependent splitter to illustrate the capabilities of the design framework. The performance for all three devices is optimized using transfer matrix calculations; and their final responses are verified through 3D-FDTD simulations. All devices demonstrate state-of-the-art performance metrics with over 20 dB extinction, and flat-top transmission bands through bandwidths of 120 nm. In addition to the functional diversity enabled, the optimization for each device is completed in under a minute, highlighting the computational efficiency of the design paradigm presented. These results demonstrate the versatility of the deep photonic network design ecosystem in polarization management, unveiling promising prospects for advanced on-chip applications in optical communications, sensing, and computing.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Quantum Electrodynamics with Moir\'e Flatband Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir\'e patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moir\'e photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir\'e cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moir\'e cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moir\'e flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</description>

      <title>Bisingular surface polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves in anisotropic media (e.g., weakly absorbing biaxial dielectric crystals) have a singular profile of the form $\propto (\mathbf{n} \mathbf{r}) \exp(i q \mathbf{n} \mathbf{r})$ along special directions, they are also known as Voigt waves. Therefore, for such directions, the wave polarization depend on the coordinate. A similar singular form is possible for surface waves, but the conditions for its appearance are less strict. The boundary between two, generally different, uniaxial media is considered. Conditions have been determined under which a surface polariton can propagate along the boundary and has a field distribution of singular form in both media. The existence condition of a bisingular surface polariton strongly depends on the angle between the optic axes of the media. It is shown that in simple cases (one the media is almost isotropic, or two identical uniaxial media) a bisingular polariton exists only for a single angle between the optic axes. In general, for two arbitrary media there can be up to five such angles.</description>

      <title>Turnkey deterministic soliton crystal generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deterministic generation of robust soliton comb has significant meaning for the optical frequency combs to be widely used in various applications. As a novel form of microcomb, Soliton crystal holds the advantages of easy generation, high conversion efficiency, and excellent thermal robustness. Here, we report the turnkey deterministic generation of "Palm-like" soliton crystal with a free-running scheme. The robustness of the turnkey soliton crystal generation is also investigated in multiple aspects, including the success rate, the thermal robustness, and the long-term stability. The experiment results reveal our turnkey soliton crystal can achieve nearly a 100% success rate with a power variation less than 1.5 dB over one hundred trials of two samples, is insensitive to thermal effect, and is robust to the environment during four-hour laboratory time.</description>

      <title>Mono-drive single-sideband modulation via optical delay lines on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical single-sideband (SSB) modulation features high spectral efficiency, substantial dispersion tolerance, and straightforward detection, making it a versatile technology for applications in optical communications, microwave photonics, optical sensing, satellite communication, etc. However, conventional SSB generators typically require two radio-frequency (RF) signals with a 90{\deg} phase difference to drive a pair of parallel phase or amplitude modulators, resulting in high system complexity and low power efficiency. In this paper, we propose and realize a simplified SSB generation scheme necessitating only a single RF drive, by achieving effective RF phase shift using on-chip optical delay lines. This approach not only reduces system complexity and saves energy consumption by 3 dB, but also enables easy scalability to higher frequencies. We demonstrate both full-carrier SSB (FC-SSB) and carrier-suppressed SSB (CS-SSB) modulation on thin-film lithium niobate platform. For FC-SSB, we show a maximum sideband suppression of 22.1 dB at 50 GHz and apply it to address the frequency-selective power fading problem in optical communication systems. For CS-SSB, we show a maximum sideband suppression of 22.5 dB and a sideband-to-carrier suppression of 16.9 dB at 50 GHz, which can act as an optical frequency shifter by sweeping the modulation frequencies. Moreover, the shifted optical frequency can be transferred back to the electrical domain by beating with a reference signal generated via a phase modulator on the same chip, achieving broadband RF frequency shifting from a maximum of 50 GHz down to 1 GHz. Our simple, power-efficient, and low-cost SSB modulation scheme could provide an effective solution for future high-frequency direct detection-based communication systems, frequency-modulated continuous wave radar/LiDAR, optical vector network analyzers, and microwave photonics systems.</description>

      <title>Resurfaced CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Enable Free Radical Thermal Polymerization of Efficient Ultrafast Polyvinyl Styrene Nanocomposite Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP-NCs) embedded in a plastic matrix are highly promising for a variety of photonic technologies and are quickly gaining attention as ultrafast, radiation-resistant nanoscintillators for radiation detection. However, advancements in LHP-NC-based photonics are hindered by their well-known thermal instability, which makes them unsuitable for industrial thermally activated mass polymerization processes - crucial for creating polystyrene-based scintillating nanocomposites. In this study, we address this challenge by presenting the first thermal nanocomposite scintillators made from CsPbBr3 NCs passivated with fluorinated ligands that remain attached to the particles surfaces even at high temperatures, enabling their integration into mass-cured polyvinyl toluene without compromising optical properties. Consequently, these nanocomposites demonstrate scintillation light yields reaching 10,400 photons/MeV, sub-nanosecond scintillation kinetics, and remarkable radiation resilience, able to withstand gamma radiation doses of up to 1 MGy. This performance not only meets but also exceeds the scintillation of plastic scintillators, despite the radiation-induced damage to the host matrix.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing with all-optical non-fading memory in a self-pulsing microresonator network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neuromorphic computing may offer promising applications for a broad range of photonic sensors, including optical fiber sensors, to enhance their functionality while avoiding loss of information, energy consumption, and latency due to optical-electrical conversion. However, time-dependent sensor signals usually exhibit much slower timescales than photonic processors, which also generally lack energy-efficient long-term memory. To address this, we experimentally demonstrate a first implementation of physical reservoir computing with non-fading memory for multi-timescale signal processing. This is based on a fully passive network of 64 coupled silicon microring resonators. Our compact photonic reservoir is capable of hosting energy-efficient nonlinear dynamics and multistability. It can process and retain input signal information for an extended duration, at least tens of microseconds. Our reservoir computing system can learn to infer the timing of a single input pulse and the spike rate of an input spike train, even after a relatively long period following the end of the input excitation. We demonstrate this operation at two different timescales, with approximately a factor of 5 difference. This work presents a novel approach to extending the memory of photonic reservoir computing and its timescale of application.</description>

      <title>D-band MUTC Photodiode Module for Ultra-Wideband 160 Gbps Photonics-Assisted Fiber-THz Integrated Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.</description>

      <title>Excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons through optically-induced ultrafast transient gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast excitation of non-equilibrium carriers under intense pulses offer unique opportunities for controlling optical properties of semiconductor materials. In this work, we propose a scheme for ultrafast generation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) via a transient metagrating formed under two interfering optical pump pulses in the semiconductor GaAs thin film. The grating can be formed due to modulation of the refractive index associated with the non-equilibrium carriers generation. The formed temporal grating structure enables generation of SPP waves at GaAs/Ag interface via weak probe pulse excitation. We propose a theoretical model describing non-equilibrium carriers formation and diffusion and their contribution to permittivity modulation via Drude and band-filling mechanisms. We predict that by tuning the parameters of the pump and probe one can reach critical coupling regime and achieve efficient generation of SPP at the times scales of 0.1-1 ps.</description>

      <title>Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large ring lasers employed in geodesy and fundamental physics require stability of the perimeter at or below the parts-per-billion level. We present two complementary approaches to actively control the perimeter length of such ring lasers, reaching a relative length stability of $4\times 10^{-10}$. These methods can readily be implemented and bring the stability of heterolithic devices on par with monolithic designs.</description>

      <title>Sub-kilohertz intrinsic linewidth stimulated Brillouin laser in integrated lithium niobate microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) photonics has spurred interest in approaches to develop ultra-narrow linewidth Brillouin microlasers. Here we demonstrate an integrated Brillouin microlaser with 118-Hz intrinsic linewidth and 3.15-mW threshold power in a dispersion engineered and suspended LNOI microdisk resonator of 116 um diameter. Benefited from the ultrahigh Q factor and sub-millimeter-scale microresonator, large Brillouin gain is attained via the backward intermodal SBS between the dual-resonant optical WGMs with a 10-GHz whispering-gallery mechanical mode, while satisfying the requirements of both energy and momentum conservations. Such strong optomechanical coupling up to 12.1 kHz is promising for a record narrow linewidth and a lowest stimulated Brillouin laser threshold value within sub-millimeter-scale integrated microresonators reported so far. This advancement in integrated ultra-narrow linewidth Brillouin lasers with compact cavity lengths paves the way for applications ranging from coherent information processing to precision metrology within the realm of high density photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-loss slow-light thin-film lithium-niobate optical modulator</title>

Abstract: Electro-optic modulators for next-generation optical interconnects require low loss-efficiency products, compact footprints, high modulation efficiency, broad bandwidths, and low losses. Here we propose and demonstrate a low-loss high-efficiency thin-film lithium-niobate Mach Zehnder modulator enabled by a novel ultralow-loss slow-light structure based on apodized gratings in cascade. The present loss-engineered slow-light structure achieves excess losses as low as 0.6 dB/mm experimentally, which is tens of times lower than conventional slow-light structures, and a high modulation bandwidth up to 320GHz in theory is achieved with optimally-designed capacitively-loaded traveling-wave electrodes. Experimentally, the fabricated slow-light modulator with a 2.8-mm-long modulation region has an ultra-low loss-efficiency product of 7.4 VdB and a flat electro-optic response up to 67 GHz, enabling 100-Gbps on-off keying with high ERs of 4.5 dB at a low driving voltage of 2Vpp, while 200-Gbps PAM4 and 150-Gbps PAM8 signals are also generated to show great promise for advanced modulation formats. In particular, it has also achieved the highest figure-of-merit(FOM) of 182 for high-speed optical modulation , including the bit rate, the extinction ratio normalized with respective to Vpp, the modulation efficiency. The outstanding performance of the present apodized-grating-based slow-light modulator shows great potential and paves the way for developing high-speed optical interconnects for both data-centers and high-performance computing systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fluorescence Lifetime Parameter Estimation Accuracy with Differential Transformer Based Deep Learning Model Incorporating Pixelwise Instrument Response Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is an important molecular imaging modality that can provide unique information for biomedical applications. FLI is based on acquiring and processing photon time of arrival histograms. The shape and temporal offset of these histograms depends on many factors, such as the instrument response function (IRF), optical properties, and the topographic profile of the sample. Several inverse solver analytical methods have been developed to compute the underlying fluorescence lifetime parameters, but most of them are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Thus, deep learning (DL) algorithms have progressively replaced computation methods in fluorescence lifetime parameter estimation. Often, DL models are trained with simple datasets either generated through simulation or a simple experiment where the fluorophore surface profile is mostly flat; therefore, DL models often do not perform well on samples with complex surface profiles such as ex-vivo organs or in-vivo whole intact animals. Herein, we introduce a new DL architecture using state-of-the-art Differential Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, MFliNet (Macroscopic FLI Network), that takes an additional input of IRF together with TPSF, addressing discrepancies in the photon time-of-arrival distribution. We demonstrate the model's performance through carefully designed, complex tissue-mimicking phantoms and preclinical in-vivo cancer xenograft experiments.</description>

      <title>Photonic Spin Hall Effect in a Four-Level Coherent Control Scheme within Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the manipulation of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and $\Lambda$ (CTL), or $\Lambda$, or $N$ level model by manipulating the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable PSHE over the wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance, the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits PSHE similar to the CTL system, showing enhanced PSHE due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density show no influence on PSHE. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence PSHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for PSHE manipulation. The results are equally valid and applicable to direct $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity QED. The demonstrated tunability via probe field detuning, control fields, and atomic density paves the way for advanced optical control and enhanced precision in cavity QED devices.</description>

      <title>Polarization and Orbital Angular Momentum Encoded Quantum Toffoli Gate Enabled by Diffractive Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled quantum gates play a crucial role in enabling quantum universal operations by facilitating interactions between qubits. Direct implementation of three-qubit gates simplifies the design of quantum circuits, thereby being conducive to performing complex quantum algorithms. Here, we propose and present an experimental demonstration of a quantum Toffoli gate fully exploiting the polarization and orbital angular momentum of a single photon. The Toffoli gate is implemented using the polarized diffractive neural networks scheme, achieving a mean truth table visibility of $97.27\pm0.20\%$. We characterize the gate's performance through quantum state tomography on 216 different input states and quantum process tomography, which yields a process fidelity of $94.05\pm 0.02\%$. Our method offers a novel approach for realizing the Toffoli gate without requiring exponential optical elements while maintaining extensibility to the implementation of other three-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>High strehl and high contrast for the ELT instrument METIS -- Final design, implementation, and predicted performance of the single-conjugate adaptive optics system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) is a first-generation instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Europe's next-generation 39 m ground-based telescope for optical and infrared wavelengths. METIS will offer diffraction-limited imaging, low- and medium-resolution slit spectroscopy, and coronagraphy for high-contrast imaging between 3 and 13 microns, as well as high-resolution integral field spectroscopy between 3 and 5 microns. The main METIS science goals are the detection and characterisation of exoplanets, the investigation of proto-planetary disks, and the formation of planets.
  The Single-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) system corrects atmospheric distortions and is thus essential for diffraction-limited observations with METIS. Numerous challenging aspects of an ELT Adaptive Optics (AO) system are addressed in the mature designs for the SCAO control system and the SCAO hardware module: the complex interaction with the telescope entities that participate in the AO control, wavefront reconstruction with a fragmented and moving pupil, secondary control tasks to deal with differential image motion, non-common path aberrations and mis-registration. A K-band pyramid wavefront sensor and a GPU-based Real-Time Computer (RTC), tailored to the needs of METIS at the ELT, are core components. This current paper serves as a natural sequel to our previous work presented in Hippler et al. (2018). It includes updated performance estimations in terms of several key performance indicators, including achieved contrast curves. We outline all important design decisions that were taken, and present the major challenges we faced and the main analyses carried out to arrive at these decisions and eventually the final design. We also elaborate on our testing and verification strategy, and, last not least, comprehensively present the full design, hardware and software.</description>

      <title>Singly poled thin film lithium niobate waveguide as a tunable source of photon pairs across telecom band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), especially in non-linear waveguides, serves as an important process to generate quantum states of light with desired properties. In this work, we report on a design of a strongly dispersive, singly poled thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) waveguide geometry which acts as a convertible source of photon pairs across telecom band with tunable spectral properties. Through our simulations, we demonstrate that by using this optimized waveguide geometry, two completely different yet desirable type II phase-matched SPDC processes are enabled using a single poling period. One process generates spectrally correlated non-degenerate photon pairs with one photon at 1310 nm (telecom O band) and the other at 1550 nm (telecom C band). The second SPDC process results in spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs in telecom C band at 1533 nm and 1567 nm respectively.We attribute this versatility of TFLN waveguide to its strong dispersion properties and make a comparative study with the existing weakly dispersive waveguide platforms. We believe that such a versatile source of photon pairs will serve as an important ingredient in various quantum optical tasks which require photons at different telecom bands and desired spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Broadband coherent XUV light from $e^-/e^+$ microbunching in an intense laser pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are instrumental for studying sub-atomic dynamics, and are often produced from a free electron laser (FEL) by electron microbunches in an undulator. An optical-FEL (OFEL) utilizes a counter-propagating laser pulse instead of an undulator, and has been proposed as a more compact and tunable source than a FEL. Yet, an OFEL is difficult to realize because of the high electron density required and subsequent high emittance. We demonstrate that broadband coherent XUV light, which in the temporal domain corresponds to a train of attosecond pulses with 8-as duration at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in an optical laser pulse. The symmetry between electrons and positrons in the bunch stabilizes the system and enables the rapid formation of dense microbunches over a ten-micrometer distance instead of the tens of meters typically required in an undulator. The high microbunch density and the stable spectral phase up to emitted photon energies of about 350 eV, allow for the creation of orders of magnitude more compact sources of XUV light that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nano-heterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirms the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium, and the correlation of the growth parameters with the nanoscale structure was analyzed using advanced electron microscopy. The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lasers and nano-LEDs and quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Classifying Photonic Topology Using the Spectral Localizer and Numerical $K$-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras, and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology. In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework, including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.</description>

      <title>Enabling low threshold laser through an asymmetric tetramer metasurface harnessing polarization-independent quasi-BICs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and numerically demonstrate a novel strategy to achieve dual-band symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) based on a nanodisk tetramer metasurface for lasing generation. The method involves breaking the in-plane symmetry along the diagonal of the metasurface unit cell by introducing air holes in the tetramers. Through our simulations, we show that this flexible approach enables the support of dual-band BICs in the telecom-band range, with these modes evolving into quasi-BICs with remarkably high quality factors by breaking the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, the ultracompact device exhibits the unique characteristic of being polarization-independent across all viewing angles. Finally, the optically pumped gain medium provides sufficient optical gain to compensate the quasi-BIC mode losses, enabling two mode lasing with ultra-low pump threshold and very narrow optical linewidth in the telecom-band range. Our adaptable device paves the way for polarization-insensitive metasurfaces with multiple lasing resonances. This innovation holds the potential to transform areas like low-threshold lasing and biosensing by delivering improved performance and broader capabilities.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for non-Hermitian continuum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most pronounced non-Hermitian phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin effect, which refers to the exponential localization of bulk eigenstates near the boundaries of non-Hermitian systems. Whereas non-Bloch band theory has been developed to describe the non-Hermitian skin effect in lattice systems, its counterpart in continuum systems still lacks a quantitative characterization. Here, we generalize the non-Bloch band theory to non-Hermitian continuum systems. In contrast to lattice systems for which the bulk Hamiltonian alone determines the non-Hermitian skin effect and energy spectrum, we find for continuum systems that the number of boundary conditions, i.e., the number of independent differential equations satisfied by wavefunctions at two boundaries, must also be included as essential information. We show that the appropriate discretization of continuum systems into lattice models requires matching the hopping range of the latter with the number of boundary conditions in the former. Furthermore, in periodic non-Hermitian continuum systems, we highlight the application of the transfer matrix in determining the generalized Brillouin zone. Our theory serves as a useful toolbox for investigating the rich non-Bloch physics in non-Hermitian continuum systems, such as photonic crystals, elastic media, and certain cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Solvent Effect on NAPBr Dye's Two-photon Absorption Ability and Non-Radiative Transition in Lipid Droplets Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-photon fluorescence imaging has shown a promising application in biomedical imaging due to its outstanding advantages such as large penetration depth, low photo-damage, and photo-bleaching, etc. Among them, the two-photon fluorescent dye NAPBr, which can effectively select and monitor lipid droplets in living cells and biological tissues, has attracted extensive attention because of its excellent fluorescent properties. However, the research on the fluorescent abilities of two-photon fluorescent dyes in solvent environment is not sufficient. In our work, theoretical analysis reveals the internal mechanism of the solvent effect on geometric structure and photophysical properties of two-photon fluorescent dyes, especially non-radiative transition process, and holes-electrons distribution and transfer. This can provide a reference for the development of efficient two-photon absorption (TPA) molecules with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics. Related data also showed good regularity. Moreover, dye in four solvents have excellent photophysical properties: high fluorescence quantum efficiency (up to 66.60%), large Stokes shift (up to 108696 cm-1), and two-photon absorption cross section (up to 3658 GM). The medium dielectric constant solution environment can achieve a balance between two-photon absorption and fluorescence emission capabilities better, which lays a solid foundation for the study of TPA molecules with AIE functions in terms of solvent effects.</description>

      <title>Neural refractive index field: Unlocking the Potential of Background-oriented Schlieren Tomography in Volumetric Flow Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background-oriented Schlieren tomography (BOST) is a prevalent method for visualizing intricate turbulent flows, valued for its ease of implementation and capacity to capture three-dimensional distributions of a multitude of flow parameters. However, the voxel-based meshing scheme leads to significant challenges, such as inadequate spatial resolution, substantial discretization errors, poor noise immunity, and excessive computational costs. This work presents an innovative reconstruction approach termed neural refractive index field (NeRIF) which implicitly represents the flow field with a neural network, which is trained with tailored strategies. Both numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations on turbulent Bunsen flames suggest that our approach can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution while concurrently reducing computational expenses. Although showcased in the context of background-oriented schlieren tomography here, the key idea embedded in the NeRIF can be readily adapted to various other tomographic modalities including tomographic absorption spectroscopy and tomographic particle imaging velocimetry, broadening its potential impact across different domains of flow visualization and analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a compelling platform for both classical and quantum technologies. In particular, the past decade has witnessed a surge of novel ideas and developments, which may be overwhelming for newcomers to the field. This review provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and key applications of hBN, including quantum sensing, quantum key distribution, quantum computing, and quantum memory. Additionally, we highlight critical experimental and theoretical advances that have expanded the capabilities of hBN, in a cohesive and accessible manner. The objective is to equip readers with a comprehensive understanding of the diverse applications of hBN, and provide insights into ongoing research efforts.</description>
