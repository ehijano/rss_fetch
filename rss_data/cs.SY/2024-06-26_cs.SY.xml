      <title>Robust Optimal Lane-changing Control for Connected Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive time and energy-optimal policies for a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) to execute lane change maneuvers in mixed traffic, i.e., in the presence of both CAVs and Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs). These policies are also shown to be robust with respect to the unpredictable behavior of HDVs by exploiting CAV cooperation which can eliminate or greatly reduce the interaction between CAVs and HDVs. We derive a simple threshold-based criterion on the initial relative distance between two cooperating CAVs based on which an optimal policy is selected such that the lane-changing CAV merges ahead of a cooperating CAV in the target lane; in this case, the lane-changing CAV's trajectory becomes independent of HDV behavior. Otherwise, the interaction between CAVs and neighboring HDVs is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem with an appropriate behavioral model for an HDV, and an iterated best response (IBR) method is used to determine an equilibrium. We demonstrate the convergence of the IBR process under certain conditions. Furthermore, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are implemented to ensure the robustness of lane-changing behaviors by guaranteeing safety in both longitudinal and lateral directions despite HDV disturbances. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our CAV controllers in terms of cost, safety guarantees, and limited disruption to traffic flow. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of the lane-changing behaviors in the presence of uncontrollable HDVs.</description>

      <title>Neural network based model predictive control of voltage for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell system with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fuel cell system must output a steady voltage as a power source in practical use. A neural network (NN) based model predictive control (MPC) approach is developed in this work to regulate the fuel cell output voltage with safety constraints. The developed NN MPC controller stabilizes the polymer electrolyte fuel cell system's output voltage by controlling the hydrogen and air flow rates at the same time. The safety constraints regarding the hydrogen pressure limit and input change rate limit are considered. The neural network model is built to describe the system voltage and hydrogen pressure behavior. Simulation results show that the NN MPC can control the voltage at the desired value while satisfying the safety constraints under workload disturbance. The NN MPC shows a comparable performance of the MPC based on the detailed underlying system physical model.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Control for Safety Under Input Constraints Using a Composition of Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new closed-form optimal control that satisfies both safety constraints (i.e., state constraints) and input constraints (e.g., actuator limits) using a composition of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs). This main result is obtained through the combination of several new ideas. First, we present a method for constructing a single CBF from multiple CBFs, which can have different relative degrees. The construction relies on a log-sum-exponential soft-minimum function and yields a CBF whose zero-superlevel set is a subset of the intersection of the zero-superlevel sets of all the CBFs used in the composition. Next, we use the composite soft-minimum CBF to construct a closed-form control that is optimal with respect to a quadratic cost subject to the safety constraints. Finally, we extend the approach and develop a closed-form optimal control that not only guarantees safety but also respects input constraints. The key elements in developing this novel closed-form control include: the introduction of the control dynamics, which allow the input constraints to be transformed into constraints on the state of the closed-loop system, and the use of the composite soft-minimum CBF to compose multiple safety and input CBFs, which have different relative degrees, into a single CBF. We also demonstrate these new control approaches on a nonholonomic ground robot example.</description>

      <title>Tolerance of Reinforcement Learning Controllers against Deviations in Cyber Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) with reinforcement learning (RL)-based controllers are increasingly being deployed in complex physical environments such as autonomous vehicles, the Internet-of-Things(IoT), and smart cities. An important property of a CPS is tolerance; i.e., its ability to function safely under possible disturbances and uncertainties in the actual operation. In this paper, we introduce a new, expressive notion of tolerance that describes how well a controller is capable of satisfying a desired system requirement, specified using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under possible deviations in the system. Based on this definition, we propose a novel analysis problem, called the tolerance falsification problem, which involves finding small deviations that result in a violation of the given requirement. We present a novel, two-layer simulation-based analysis framework and a novel search heuristic for finding small tolerance violations. To evaluate our approach, we construct a set of benchmark problems where system parameters can be configured to represent different types of uncertainties and disturbancesin the system. Our evaluation shows that our falsification approach and heuristic can effectively find small tolerance violations.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Decision-Focused Learning for Modeling Strategic Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel decision-focused framework integrating the physical energy storage model into machine learning pipelines. Motivated by the model predictive control for energy storage, our end-to-end method incorporates the prior knowledge of the storage model and infers the hidden reward that incentivizes energy storage decisions. This is achieved through a dual-layer framework, combining a prediction layer with an optimization layer. We introduce the perturbation idea into the designed decision-focused loss function to ensure the differentiability over linear storage models, supported by a theoretical analysis of the perturbed loss function. We also develop a hybrid loss function for effective model training. We provide two challenging applications for our proposed framework: energy storage arbitrage, and energy storage behavior prediction. The numerical experiments on real price data demonstrate that our arbitrage approach achieves the highest profit against existing methods. The numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world energy storage data show that our approach achieves the best behavior prediction performance against existing benchmark methods, which shows the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Framework for Optimizing Wildfire Surveillance and Suppression using Human-Autonomous Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of manned and unmanned aircraft can help improve wildfire response. Wildfire containment failures occur when resources available to first responders, who execute the initial stages of wildfire management referred to as the initial attack, are ineffective or insufficient. Initial attack surveillance and suppression models have linked action spaces and objectives, making their optimization computationally challenging. The initial attack may be formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MPOMDP). We divide the initial attack MPOMDP into surveillance and suppression processes with their respective planners operating on different, but constant, time scales. A hierarchical framework iterates between surveillance and suppression planners while also providing collision avoidance. This framework is exemplified by a set of multi-rotor unmanned aircraft surveying an initial attack fire while a manned helicopter suppresses the fire with a water bucket. Wildfire-specific solver extensions are formulated to reduce the otherwise vast action spaces. The hierarchical framework outperforms firefighting techniques and a myopic baseline by up to 242% for moderate wildfires and 60% for rapid wildfires when simulated in abstracted and actual case studies. We also validate the early dispatching of additional suppression assets using regression models to ensure wildfire containment to thresholds established by wildfire agencies.</description>

      <title>Enabling Large Language Models to Perform Power System Simulations with Previously Unseen Tools: A Case of Daline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17215v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of experiment technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research, offering AI capabilities beyond specialized problem-solving to becoming research assistants for human scientists. In power systems, simulations are essential for research. However, LLMs face significant challenges in power system simulations due to limited pre-existing knowledge and the complexity of power grids. To address this issue, this work proposes a modular framework that integrates expertise from both the power system and LLM domains. This framework enhances LLMs' ability to perform power system simulations on previously unseen tools. Validated using 34 simulation tasks in Daline, a (optimal) power flow simulation and linearization toolbox not yet exposed to LLMs, the proposed framework improved GPT-4o's simulation coding accuracy from 0% to 96.07%, also outperforming the ChatGPT-4o web interface's 33.8% accuracy (with the entire knowledge base uploaded). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as research assistants in power systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Pareto Design of GaN HEMTs for Millimeter-Wave Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a robust Pareto design approach for selecting Gallium Nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs), particularly for power amplifier (PA) and low-noise amplifier (LNA) designs in 5G applications. We consider five key design variables and two settings (PAs and LNAs) where we have multiple objectives. We assess designs based on three critical objectives, evaluating each by its worst-case performance across a range of Gate-Source Voltages ($V_{\text{GS}}$). We conduct simulations across a range of $V_{\text{GS}}$ values to ensure a thorough and robust analysis. For PAs, the optimization goals are to maximize the worst-case modulated average output power ($P_{\text{out,avg}}$) and power-added efficiency ($PAE_{\text{avg}}$) while minimizing the worst-case average junction temperature ($T_{\text{j,avg}}$) under a modulated 64-QAM signal stimulus. In contrast, for LNAs, the focus is on maximizing the worst-case maximum oscillation frequency ($f_{\text{max}}$) and Gain, and minimizing the worst-case minimum noise figure ($NF_{\text{min}}$). We utilize a derivative-free optimization method to effectively identify robust Pareto optimal device designs. This approach enhances our comprehension of the trade-off space, facilitating more informed decision-making. Furthermore, this method is general across different applications. Although it does not guarantee a globally optimal design, we demonstrate its effectiveness in GaN device sizing. The primary advantage of this method is that it enables the attainment of near-optimal or even optimal designs with just a fraction of the simulations required for an exhaustive full-grid search.</description>

      <title>Optimal DC-link Voltage from Weight and Loss Perspective for eVTOLs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft are emerging as a modern transportation solution aimed at reducing urban traffic congestion and improving the carbon footprint. The power architecture in eVTOLs is defined by the dc bus formed by the battery packs and the power converter used to drive eVTOL motors. A high dc bus voltage is preferred for the power architecture since it can reduce the weight of power cables for a given power rating. However, the impact of high dc bus voltage on the efficiency of the drivetrain power converter must be considered, since reduced efficiency leads to poor battery pack utilization. In this paper, a systematic optimization study is performed considering SiC-based inverter for the drivetrain power converter. Optimal value of dc bus voltage is determined considering the flight profile of eVTOLs. A power converter topology is proposed that can provide optimal performance and enhance the lifetime of the batteries along with providing better monitoring, diagnostics and protection. The optimization strategy is validated experimentally, demonstrating the proposed power architecture's ability to maximize efficiency while enhancing the safety of the battery energy storage system in eVTOLs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy-Efficient Braking Trajectories with Anticipatory Road Data for Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning in automated driving typically focuses on satisfying safety and comfort requirements within the vehicle's onboard sensor range. This paper introduces a method that leverages anticipatory road data, such as speed limits, road slopes, and traffic lights, beyond the local perception range to optimize energy-efficient braking trajectories. For that, coasting, which reduces energy consumption, and active braking are combined to transition from the current vehicle velocity to a lower target velocity at a given distance ahead. Finding the switching instants between the coasting phases and the continuous control for the braking phase is addressed as an optimal trade-off between maximizing coasting periods and minimizing braking effort. The resulting switched optimal control problem is solved by deriving necessary optimality conditions. To facilitate the incorporation of additional feasibility constraints for multi-phase trajectories, a sub-optimal alternative solution based on parametric optimization is proposed. Both methods are compared in simulation.</description>

      <title>Position and Time Determination without Prior State Knowledge via Onboard Optical Observations of Delta Scuti Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a navigation concept for solving the lost in space and time problem using optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti variable stars. Only a small number of techniques exist that allow a spacecraft to recover from being lost in both space and time, which can be caused by a failure of the onboard clock and navigation systems. Optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti stars, which can be collected onboard from star trackers or navigation cameras, may enable faster and/or more accurate position and time solutions compared to existing techniques without requiring additional equipment. Our results indicate that one day of observation by the OSIRIS-APEX MapCam may enable position and time determination accuracy within 0.05 au (3$\sigma$) and 15 s (3$\sigma$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a systematic approach to developing Physics-Informed neuro-Models (PIM) for the transient analysis of power grids interconnected with renewables. PIM verifies itself as an adequate digital twin of power components, taking full advantage of physical constraints while requiring only a small fraction of data for training. Three new contributions are presented: 1) An PINN-enabled neuro-modeling approach is devised to construct an accurate EMT model; 2) A data-physics hybrid learning approach is substantiated to demonstrate its data efficiency and adaptability at various levels of data; 3) A balanced-adaptive PIM exemplifies its applicability when multiple terms are predicted simultaneously while maintaining alignment with physical principles. Under various operational scenarios, tests on rotating and static electric components as well as an IEEE test system verifies the efficacy and efficiency of the new learning-infused transient grid analytics.</description>

      <title>Automatic Parameter Tuning of Self-Driving Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern automated driving solutions utilize trajectory planning and control components with numerous parameters that need to be tuned for different driving situations and vehicle types to achieve optimal performance. This paper proposes a method to automatically tune such parameters to resemble expert demonstrations. We utilize a cost function which captures deviations of the closed-loop operation of the controller from the recorded desired driving behavior. Parameter tuning is then accomplished by using local optimization techniques. Three optimization alternatives are compared in a case study, where a trajectory planner is tuned for lane following in a real-world driving scenario. The results suggest that the proposed approach improves manually tuned initial parameters significantly even with respect to noisy demonstration data.</description>

      <title>Rational-Exponent Filters with Applications to Generalized Auditory Filterbanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present filters with rational exponents in order to provide a continuum of filter behavior not classically achievable. We discuss their stability, the flexibility they afford, and various representations useful for analysis, design and implementations. We do this for a generalization of second order filters which we refer to as rational-exponent Generalized Auditory Filters/Filterbanks (GAFs) that are useful for a diverse array of applications. We present equivalent representations for rational-order GAFs in the time and frequency domains: transfer functions, impulse responses, and integral expressions - the last of which allows for efficient real-time processing without preprocessing requirements. Rational-exponent filters enable filter characteristics to be on a continuum rather than limiting them to discrete values thereby resulting in greater flexibility in the behavior of these filters. In the case of GAFs, this allows for having arbitrary continuous rather than discrete values for filter characteristics such as (1) the ratio of 3dB quality factor to maximum group delay - particularly important for filterbanks which have simultaneous requirements on frequency selectivity and synchronization; and (2) the ratio of 3dB to 15dB quality factors that dictates the shape of the frequency response magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Energy System Model Resolution on Siting, Cost, Reliability, and Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy systems models, critical for power sector decision support, incur non-linear memory and runtime penalties when scaling up under typical formulations. Even hardware improvements cannot make large models tractable, requiring omission of detail which affects siting, cost, and emission outputs to an unknown degree. Recent algorithmic innovations have enabled large scale, high resolution modeling. Newly tractable, granular systems can be compared with coarse ones for better understanding of inaccuracies from low resolution. Here we use a state of the art model to quantify the impact of resolution on results salient to policymakers and planners, affording confidence in decision quality. We find more realistic siting in recommendations from high resolution energy systems models, improving emissions, reliability, and price outcomes. Errors are generally stronger from low spatial resolution. When models have low resolution in multiple dimensions, errors are introduced by the coarser of temporal or spatial resolution. We see no diminishing returns in accuracy for several key metrics when increasing resolution. We recommend using computationally efficient techniques to maximize granularity and allocating resolution without leaving any aspect (spatial, temporal, operational) of systems unduly coarse.</description>

Abstract: Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on vibration signals is crucial for ensuring the safe operation and effective health management of rotating machinery. Existing studies often extract health indicators (HI) from time domain and frequency domain features to analyze complex vibration signals, but these features may not accurately capture the degradation process. In this study, we propose a degradation feature extraction method called Fusion of Multi-Modal Multi-Scale Entropy (FMME), which utilizes multi-modal Refined Composite Multi-scale Attention Entropy (RCMATE) and Fluctuation Dispersion Entropy (RCMFDE), to solve the problem that the existing degradation features cannot accurately reflect the degradation process. Firstly, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose the dual-channel vibration signals of bearings into multiple modals. The main modals are then selected for further analysis. The subsequent step involves the extraction of RCMATE and RCMFDE from each modal, followed by wavelet denoising. Next, a novel metric is proposed to evaluate the quality of degradation features. The attention entropy and dispersion entropy of the optimal scales under different modals are fused using Laplacian Eigenmap (LE) to obtain the health indicators. Finally, RUL prediction is performed through the similarity of health indicators between fault samples and bearings to be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields favorable outcomes across diverse operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Coded Kalman Filtering over MIMO Gaussian Channels with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of remotely stabilizing a linear dynamical system. In this setting, a sensor co-located with the system communicates the system's state to a controller over a noisy communication channel with feedback. The objective of the controller (decoder) is to use the channel outputs to estimate the vector state with finite zero-delay mean squared error (MSE) at the infinite horizon. It has been shown in [1] that for a vector Gauss-Markov source and either a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) or a multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel, linear codes require the minimum capacity to achieve finite MSE. This paper considers the more general problem of linear zero-delay joint-source channel coding (JSCC) of a vector-valued source over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian channel with feedback. We study sufficient and necessary conditions for linear codes to achieve finite MSE. For sufficiency, we introduce a coding scheme where each unstable source mode is allocated to a single channel for estimation. Our proof for the necessity of this scheme relies on a matrix-algebraic conjecture that we prove to be true if either the source or channel is scalar. We show that linear codes achieve finite MSE for a scalar source over a MIMO channel if and only if the best scalar sub-channel can achieve finite MSE. Finally, we provide a new counter-example demonstrating that linear codes are generally sub-optimal for coding over MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>A Near-Field Super-Resolution Network for Accelerating Antenna Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep neural network-enabled method to accelerate near-field (NF) antenna measurement. We develop a Near-field Super-resolution Network (NFS-Net) to reconstruct significantly undersampled near-field data as high-resolution data, which considerably reduces the number of sampling points required for NF measurement and thus improves measurement efficiency. The high-resolution near-field data reconstructed by the network is further processed by a near-field-to-far-field (NF2FF) transformation to obtain far-field antenna radiation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the NFS-Net exhibits both accuracy and generalizability in restoring high-resolution near-field data from low-resolution input. The NF measurement workflow that combines the NFS-Net and the NF2FF algorithm enables accurate radiation pattern characterization with only 11% of the Nyquist rate samples. Though the experiments in this study are conducted on a planar setup with a uniform grid, the proposed method can serve as a universal strategy to accelerate measurements under different setups and conditions.</description>

      <title>Prioritized experience replay-based DDQN for Unmanned Vehicle Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path planning module is a key module for autonomous vehicle navigation, which directly affects its operating efficiency and safety. In complex environments with many obstacles, traditional planning algorithms often cannot meet the needs of intelligence, which may lead to problems such as dead zones in unmanned vehicles. This paper proposes a path planning algorithm based on DDQN and combines it with the prioritized experience replay method to solve the problem that traditional path planning algorithms often fall into dead zones. A series of simulation experiment results prove that the path planning algorithm based on DDQN is significantly better than other methods in terms of speed and accuracy, especially the ability to break through dead zones in extreme environments. Research shows that the path planning algorithm based on DDQN performs well in terms of path quality and safety. These research results provide an important reference for the research on automatic navigation of autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Operating envelopes for the grid-constrained use of distributed flexibility in balancing markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing share of distributed energy sources enhances the participation potential of distributed flexibility in the provision of system services. However, this participation can endanger the grid-safety of the distribution networks (DNs) from which this flexibility originates. In this paper, the use of operating envelopes (OE) to enable the grid-safe procurement of distributed flexibility in centralized balancing markets is proposed. Two classes of approaches for calculating OEs (one-step and two-step methods) are compared in terms of the level of distribution grid safety they can provide, the impact they can have on the market efficiency, and the volume of discarded flexibility they can yield. A case study considering different system scenarios, based on Monte Carlo simulations, highlights a trade-off between the market efficiency, DN flexibility resource utilization, and the grid safety delivered by the different OE methods. The results showcase that the use of the two-step OE approach results in a more grid-secure albeit less-efficient use of distributed flexibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specifying a prior distribution is an essential part of solving Bayesian inverse problems. The prior encodes a belief on the nature of the solution and this regularizes the problem. In this article we completely characterize a Gaussian prior that encodes the belief that the solution is a structured tensor. We first define the notion of (A,b)-constrained tensors and show that they describe a large variety of different structures such as Hankel, circulant, triangular, symmetric, and so on. Then we completely characterize the Gaussian probability distribution of such tensors by specifying its mean vector and covariance matrix. Furthermore, explicit expressions are proved for the covariance matrix of tensors whose entries are invariant under a permutation. These results unlock a whole new class of priors for Bayesian inverse problems. We illustrate how new kernel functions can be designed and efficiently computed and apply our results on two particular Bayesian inverse problems: completing a Hankel matrix from a few noisy measurements and learning an image classifier of handwritten digits. The effectiveness of the proposed priors is demonstrated for both problems. All applications have been implemented as reactive Pluto notebooks in Julia.</description>

      <title>Coordinating O&amp;M and Logistical Resources to Enhance Post-Disaster Resilience of Interdependent Power and Natural Gas Distribution Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric power and natural gas systems are becoming increasingly interdependent, driven by the growth of natural gas-fired generation and the electrification of the gas industry. Recent energy crises have underscored the urgent need for enhanced resilience in these interdependent systems. In response to this challenge, this paper focuses on the interdependent electric power and natural gas distribution systems and proposes a comprehensive strategy for enhancing their resilience, which involves optimally coordinating various resources encompassing emergency operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) and logistical support, to efficiently restore damaged services and infrastructure. Specifically, generators, including those with fuel switching capability, are dispatched to provide emergency power, with the logistical process of fuel supply being particularly managed by coordinated scheduling of mobile fuel tankers. Additionally, integrated demand responses for power and gas are dispatched to alleviate operational stresses using a zonewise approach that groups customers with intertwined energy supplies into individual, dispatchable units. Furthermore, the strategy incorporates the repair of damaged facilities, with particular consideration given to the varying repair efficiencies dependent on the dispatched repair units, aiming to closely simulate actual repair scenarios. The strategy is encapsulated in a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, with case studies conducted to validate its effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: We illustrate the potential of neuromorphic control on the simple mechanical model of a pendulum, with both event-based actuation and sensing. The controller and the pendulum are regarded as event-based systems that occasionally interact to coordinate their respective rhythms. Control occurs through a proper timing of the interacting events. We illustrate the mixed nature of the control design: the design of a rhythmic automaton, able to generate the right sequence of events, and the design of a feedback regulator, able to tune the timing of events.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Precision-Timed Virtual Machine (PretVM), an intermediate platform facilitating the execution of quasi-static schedules compiled from a subset of programs written in the Lingua Franca (LF) coordination language. The subset consists of those programs that in principle should have statically verifiable and predictable timing behavior. The PretVM provides a schedule with well-defined worst-case timing bounds. The PretVM provides a clean separation between application logic and coordination logic, yielding more analyzable program executions. Experiments compare the PretVM against the default (more dynamic) LF scheduler and show that it delivers time-accurate deterministic execution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems with nonlinear dynamics are one of the most general modeling tools for representing robotic systems, especially contact-rich systems. However, providing guarantees regarding the safety or performance of nonlinear hybrid systems remains a challenging problem because it requires simultaneous reasoning about continuous state evolution and discrete mode switching. In this work, we address this problem by extending classical Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, a formal verification method for continuous-time nonlinear dynamical systems, to hybrid dynamical systems. We characterize the reachable sets for hybrid systems through a generalized value function defined over discrete and continuous states of the hybrid system. We also provide a numerical algorithm to compute this value function and obtain the reachable set. Our framework can compute reachable sets for hybrid systems consisting of multiple discrete modes, each with its own set of nonlinear continuous dynamics, discrete transitions that can be directly commanded or forced by a discrete control input, while still accounting for control bounds and adversarial disturbances in the state evolution. Along with the reachable set, the proposed framework also provides an optimal continuous and discrete controller to ensure system safety. We demonstrate our framework in several simulation case studies, as well as on a real-world testbed to solve the optimal mode planning problem for a quadruped with multiple gaits.</description>

Abstract: Interpolatory necessary optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of unstructured linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are well-known. Based on previous work on $\mathcal{L}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of stationary parametric problems, in this paper we develop and investigate optimality conditions for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order modeling of structured LTI systems, in particular, for second-order, port-Hamiltonian, and time-delay systems. Under certain diagonalizability assumptions, we show that across all these different structured settings, bitangential Hermite interpolation is the common form for optimality, thus proving a unifying optimality framework for structured reduced-order modeling.</description>

      <title>Mean-Square Exponential Stabilization of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic PDE System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of mixed-autonomy traffic where Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) coexist on the road has gained increasing attention over the recent decades. This paper addresses the boundary stabilization problem for mixed traffic on freeways. The traffic dynamics are described by uncertain coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with Markov jumping parameters, which aim to address the distinctive driving strategies between AVs and HVs. Considering that the spacing policies of AVs vary in mixed traffic, the stochastic impact area of AVs is governed by a continuous Markov chain. The interactions between HVs and AVs such as overtaking or lane changing are mainly induced by impact areas. Using backstepping design, we develop a full-state feedback boundary control law to stabilize the deterministic system (nominal system). Applying Lyapunov analysis, we demonstrate that the nominal backstepping control law is able to stabilize the traffic system with Markov jumping parameters, provided the nominal parameters are sufficiently close to the stochastic ones on average. The mean-square exponential stability conditions are derived, and the results are validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Conformal Prediction Regions with Simple Structures by Optimizing Convex Shape Templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions for machine learning models that are valid with high probability. A key component of conformal prediction algorithms is a \emph{non-conformity score function} that quantifies how different a model's prediction is from the unknown ground truth value. Essentially, these functions determine the shape and the size of the conformal prediction regions. While prior work has gone into creating score functions that produce multi-model prediction regions, such regions are generally too complex for use in downstream planning and control problems. We propose a method that optimizes parameterized \emph{shape template functions} over calibration data, which results in non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions with minimum volume. Our approach results in prediction regions that are \emph{multi-modal}, so they can properly capture residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and \emph{practical}, so each region is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous vehicles, showing an up to $68\%$ reduction in prediction region area compared to a circular baseline region.</description>

      <title>Who Plays First? Optimizing the Order of Play in Stackelberg Games with Many Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the multi-agent spatial navigation problem of computing the socially optimal order of play, i.e., the sequence in which the agents commit to their decisions, and its associated equilibrium in an N-player Stackelberg trajectory game. We model this problem as a mixed-integer optimization problem over the space of all possible Stackelberg games associated with the order of play's permutations. To solve the problem, we introduce Branch and Play (B&amp;P), an efficient and exact algorithm that provably converges to a socially optimal order of play and its Stackelberg equilibrium. As a subroutine for B&amp;P, we employ and extend sequential trajectory planning, i.e., a popular multi-agent control approach, to scalably compute valid local Stackelberg equilibria for any given order of play. We demonstrate the practical utility of B&amp;P to coordinate air traffic control, swarm formation, and delivery vehicle fleets. We find that B&amp;P consistently outperforms various baselines, and computes the socially optimal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Low-rank approximated Kalman-Bucy filters using Oja's principal component flow for linear time-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman-Bucy filter is extensively utilized across various applications. However, its computational complexity increases significantly in large-scale systems. To mitigate this challenge, a low-rank approximated Kalman--Bucy filter was proposed, comprising Oja's principal component flow and a low-dimensional Riccati differential equation. Previously, the estimation error was confirmed solely for linear time-invariant systems with a symmetric system matrix. This study extends the application by eliminating the constraint on the symmetricity of the system matrix and describes the equilibrium points of the Oja flow along with their stability for general matrices. In addition, the domain of attraction for a set of stable equilibrium points is estimated. Based on these findings, we demonstrate that the low-rank approximated Kalman--Bucy filter with a suitable rank maintains a bounded estimation error covariance matrix if the system is controllable and observable.</description>

      <title>Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01523</link>

Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users, thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.</description>

      <title>Explainable Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Cyber-Physical Systems via Causal Discovery from Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online unsupervised detection of anomalies is crucial to guarantee the correct operation of cyber-physical systems and the safety of humans interacting with them. State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of &gt;10 different anomalies.

      <title>When Large Language Models Meet Optical Networks: Paving the Way for Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of GPT, large language models (LLMs) have brought about revolutionary advancements in all walks of life. As a superior natural language processing (NLP) technology, LLMs have consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous areas. However, LLMs are considered to be general-purpose models for NLP tasks, which may encounter challenges when applied to complex tasks in specialized fields such as optical networks. In this study, we propose a framework of LLM-empowered optical networks, facilitating intelligent control of the physical layer and efficient interaction with the application layer through an LLM-driven agent (AI-Agent) deployed in the control layer. The AI-Agent can leverage external tools and extract domain knowledge from a comprehensive resource library specifically established for optical networks. This is achieved through user input and well-crafted prompts, enabling the generation of control instructions and result representations for autonomous operation and maintenance in optical networks. To improve LLM's capability in professional fields and stimulate its potential on complex tasks, the details of performing prompt engineering, establishing domain knowledge library, and implementing complex tasks are illustrated in this study. Moreover, the proposed framework is verified on two typical tasks: network alarm analysis and network performance optimization. The good response accuracies and sematic similarities of 2,400 test situations exhibit the great potential of LLM in optical networks.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization of Initial Perturbations toward Quantitative Weather Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes introducing convex optimization to find initial perturbations of atmospheric models for realizing specified changes in subsequent forecasts. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The sensitivity matrix is used to solve the inverse problem as convex optimization, in which a global optimal solution can be found computationally efficiently. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using an NWP model. The experiments showed that identified perturbation successfully realized specified spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation. These results demonstrated the possibility of controlling the real atmosphere by solving inverse problems and adding small perturbations to atmospheric states.</description>

      <title>Essentially Sharp Estimates on the Entropy Regularization Error in Discrete Discounted Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization of infinite-horizon discrete discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. We provide a lower bound matching our upper bound up to a polynomial factor. Our proof relies on the correspondence of the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes with gradient flows of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. Further, this correspondence allows us to identify the limit of the gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of the Kakade gradient flow which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use this to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations improving existing sublinear guarantees.</description>
