      <title>Temporal Dynamics of Emotions in Italian Online Soccer Fandoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the emotional dynamics of Italian soccer fandoms through computational analysis of user-generated content from official Instagram accounts of 83 teams across Serie A, Serie B, and Lega Pro during the 2023-24 season. By applying sentiment analysis to fan comments, we extract temporal emotional patterns and identify distinct clusters of fan bases with similar preseason expectations. Drawing from complex systems theory, we characterize joy as displaying anti-bursty temporal distributions, while anger is marked by pronounced bursty patterns. Our analysis reveals significant correlations between these emotional signals, preseason expectations, socioeconomic factors, and final league rankings. In particular, the burstiness metric emerges as a meaningful correlate of team performance; statistical models excluding this parameter show a decrease in the coefficient of determination of 32%. These findings offer novel insights into the relationship between fan emotional expression and team outcomes, suggesting potential avenues for research in sports analytics, social media dynamics, and fan engagement studies.</description>

      <title>Social Networks: Enumerating Maximal Community Patterns in $c$-Closed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fox, Seshadhri, Roughgarden, Wei, and Wein (SICOMP 2020) introduced the model of $c$-closed graphs--a distribution-free model motivated by triadic closure, one of the most pervasive structural signatures of social networks. While enumerating maximal cliques in general graphs can take exponential time, it is known that in $c$-closed graphs, maximal cliques and maximal complete bipartite subgraphs can always be enumerated in polynomial time. These structures correspond to blow-ups of simple patterns: a single vertex or a single edge, with some vertices required to form cliques. In this work, we explore a natural extension: we study maximal blow-ups of arbitrary finite graphs $H$ in $c$-closed graphs. We prove that for any fixed graph $H$, the number of maximal blow-ups of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $c$-closed graph is always bounded by a polynomial in $n$. We further investigate the case of induced blow-ups and provide a precise characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the number of maximal induced blow-ups is also polynomially bounded in $n$. Finally, we study the analogue questions when $H$ ranges over an infinite family of graphs.</description>

      <title>A Gamified Evaluation and Recruitment Platform for Low Resource Language Machine Translation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy, fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research.</description>

      <title>Forgetful by Design? A Critical Audit of YouTube's Search API for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper critically audits the search endpoint of YouTube's Data API (v3), a common tool for academic research. Through systematic weekly searches over six months using eleven queries, we identify major limitations regarding completeness, representativeness, consistency, and bias. Our findings reveal substantial differences between ranking parameters like relevance and date in terms of video recall and precision, with relevance often retrieving numerous off-topic videos. We also find severe temporal decay, as the number of findable videos for a specific period dramatically decreases after just 20-60 days from the publication date, potentially hampering many different research designs. Furthermore, search results lack consistency, with identical queries yielding different video sets over time, compromising replicability. A case study on the European Parliament elections highlights how these issues impact research outcomes. While the paper offers several mitigation strategies, it concludes that the API's search function, potentially prioritizing "freshness" over comprehensive retrieval, is not adequate for robust academic research, especially concerning Digital Services Act requirements.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of weighted networks: weight approximation method and its application to food webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowing which parts of a complex system have identical roles simplifies computations and reveals patterns in its network structure. Group theory has been applied to study symmetries in unweighted networks. However, in real-world weighted networks, edge weights are rarely equal, making exact symmetry uncommon. To study symmetries in weighted networks, we aggregate edge weights into a small number of discrete categories. The symmetries of these aggregated networks identify vertices with similar roles in the original weighted network.
  In food webs, this approach helps to quantify ecological co-existence and competition by assessing the functional substitutability of species. We apply our method to 250 empirical food webs, finding that symmetric vertices emerge even under weak approximations, typically forming small orbits of size two or three. These symmetric vertices can appear at any trophic level or network position. We also apply three symmetry measures to compare structural patterns at the network level.</description>

      <title>Revealing Political Bias in LLMs through Structured Multi-Agent Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.</description>

      <title>Roll in the Tanks! Measuring Left-wing Extremism on Reddit at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media's role in the spread and evolution of extremism is a focus of intense study. Online extremists have been involved in the spread of online hate, mis- and disinformation, and real-world violence. However, most existing work has focuses on right-wing extremism. In this paper, we perform a first of its kind large-scale measurement study exploring left-wing extremism. We focus on "tankies," a left-wing community that first arose in the 1950s in support of hardline actions of the USSR and has evolved to support what they call "Actually Existing Socialist" countries, e.g., CCP-run China, the USSR, and North Korea. We collect and analyze 1.3M posts from 53K authors from tankie subreddits, and explore the position of tankies within the broader far-left community on Reddit. Among other things, we find that tankies are clearly on the periphery of the larger far-left community. When examining the contents of posts, we find misalignments and conceptual homomorphisms that confirm the description of tankies in the theoretical work. We also discover that tankies focus more on state-level political events rather than social issues. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the distinct positioning and discourse of left-wing extremist groups on social media.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Datasets for Information Diffusion Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information diffusion across various new media platforms gradually influences perceptions, decisions, and social behaviors of individual users. In communication studies, the famous Five W's of Communication model (5W Model) has displayed the process of information diffusion clearly. At present, although plenty of studies and corresponding datasets about information diffusion have emerged, a systematic categorization of tasks and an integration of datasets are still lacking. To address this gap, we survey a systematic taxonomy of information diffusion tasks and datasets based on the "5W Model" framework. We first categorize the information diffusion tasks into ten subtasks with definitions and datasets analysis, from three main tasks of information diffusion prediction, social bot detection, and misinformation detection. We also collect the publicly available dataset repository of information diffusion tasks with the available links and compare them based on six attributes affiliated to users and content: user information, social network, bot label, propagation content, propagation network, and veracity label. In addition, we discuss the limitations and future directions of current datasets and research topics to advance the future development of information diffusion. The dataset repository can be accessed at our website https://github.com/fuxiaG/Information-Diffusion-Datasets.</description>

      <title>Jointly modelling the evolution of social structure and language in online communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group interactions take place within a particular socio-temporal context, which should be taken into account when modelling interactions in online communities. We propose a method for jointly modelling community structure and language over time. Our system produces dynamic word and user representations that can be used to cluster users, investigate thematic interests of groups, and predict group membership. We apply and evaluate our method in the context of a set of misogynistic extremist groups. Our results indicate that this approach outperforms prior models which lacked one of these components (i.e. not incorporating social structure, or using static word embeddings) when evaluated on clustering and embedding prediction tasks. Our method further enables novel types of analyses on online groups, including tracing their response to temporal events and quantifying their propensity for using violent language, which is of particular importance in the context of extremist groups.</description>

      <title>Stationary distribution of node2vec random walks on household models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The node2vec random walk has proven to be a key tool in network embedding algorithms. These random walks are tuneable, and their transition probabilities depend on the previous visited node and on the triangles containing the current and the previously visited node. Even though these walks are widely used in practice, most mathematical properties of node2vec walks are largely unexplored, including their stationary distribution. We study the node2vec random walk on community-structured household model graphs. We prove an explicit description of the stationary distribution of node2vec walks in terms of the walk parameters. We then show that by tuning the walk parameters, the stationary distribution can interpolate between uniform, size-biased, or the simple random walk stationary distributions, demonstrating the wide range of possible walks. We further explore these effects on some specific graph settings.</description>
