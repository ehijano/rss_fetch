      <title>Revisiting the Radius Valley Across Stellar Types: A Transit-Only Analysis of M, K, G, and F Stars with Updated NASA Exoplanet Archive Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radius valley -- a deficit of exoplanets between super-Earths and sub-Neptunes -- is a key diagnostic of planet formation and atmospheric evolution. We investigate how the radius valley depends on stellar type by analyzing an updated, transit-only sample of exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Planets are selected with $P &lt; 100$ days and divided by host spectral class (M, K, G, F). We construct weighted radius distributions and apply statistical tests to quantify the valley depth. We recover a pronounced valley centered near $\sim 1.8\,R_\oplus$ for G/K stars, but shifted to $\sim 1.6\,R_\oplus$ for M dwarfs and $\sim 1.9\,R_\oplus$ for F stars. These results support the view that the radius valley is shaped by stellar-dependent processes such as photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and orbital migration.</description>

      <title>Revealing Fine Structure in Protoplanetary Disks with Physics Constrained Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional ray tracers, enabling previously intractable, high-dimensional neural reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature missed by existing approaches. Our work establish a new paradigm for extracting complex disk structure and advancing our understanding of protoplanetary evolution.</description>

      <title>A JWST/MIRI view of k Andromedae b: Refining its mass, age, and physical parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. kAndb is a substellar companion near the planet-brown dwarf boundary, orbiting a B9IV star at 50-100 au. Estimates of its age and mass vary, fueling a decade-long debate. Atmospheric parameters (Teff 1650-2050 K, log(g) 3.5-5.5) remain poorly constrained due to model differences and heterogeneous datasets. Aims. We refine the characterization of kAndb using mid-infrared data to capture its bolometric emission. Combined with NIR measurements, we constrain Teff, log(g), and radius to reduce uncertainties in age and mass. Methods. We obtained JWST/MIRI coronagraphic data (F1065C, F1140C, F1550C) and recalibrated NIR photometry with an updated ATLAS stellar model. MIRI color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) probe the likelihood of species (CH4, NH3, silicates). We compared H and F1140C colors and magnitudes to isochrones to constrain age and mass. We modeled the spectral energy distribution with atmosphere models to refine Teff, radius, and log(g), and to constrain age and mass using evolutionary models. Results. Cloudy atmosphere models fit best, consistent with the L0/L2 spectral type and position near silicate-atmosphere field objects in the MIRI CMD. We derived an age of 47+-7 Myr and mass of 17.3+-1.8 MJup by weighted-mean model combination. Modeling yielded Teff = 1791+-68 K and radius = 1.42+-0.06 RJup, improving precision by 30%. Log(g) = 4.35+-0.07 dex represents a 70% improvement over the previous best value (4.75+-0.25). Conclusions. The new mass places kAndb just above the deuterium-burning limit. The age is 75% more precise and consistent with the Columba association (42 Myr). The Teff suggests silicate clouds, requiring spectroscopic confirmation. MIRI data were crucial to refining radius and temperature, which led to stronger constraints on age and mass and improving the overall characterization of kAndb.</description>

      <title>Proto-planetary disk composition-dependent element volatility in the context of rocky planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compositions of the Solar System terrestrial bodies are fractionated from that of the Sun, where elemental depletions in the bulk rocky bodies correlate with element volatility, expressed in its 50% condensation temperature. However, because element volatility depends on disk gas composition, it is not mandated that elemental fractionation trends derived from the solar-terrestrial scenario apply to other planetary systems. Here, we expand upon previous efforts to quantify element volatility during disk condensation, and how this affects rocky planet compositional diversity.
  We simulate condensation sequences for a sample of 1000 initial disk compositions based on observed stellar abundances. We present parametrisations of how element 50% condensation temperatures depend on disk composition, and apply element fractionation trends with appropriate element volatilty to stellar abundances to simulate compositions of rocky exoplanets with the same volatile depletion pattern as the Earth, providing a robust and conservative lower limit to the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets.
  Here we show that Earth-like planets emerge from low-C-to-O disks and graphite-bearing planets from medium-to-high-C-to-O disks. Furthermore, we identify an intermediate-C-to-O class of planets characterized by Mg and Si depletion, leading to relatively high abundances of Fe, Ca, and Al. We show that devolatilisation patterns could be adapted potentially with disk composition-dependent condensation temperatures to make predictions of rocky planet bulk compositions within individual systems. The outcomes of our analysis suggest that accounting for disk composition-dependent condensation temperatures means that we can expect an even broader range of possible rocky planet compositions than has previously been considered.</description>

      <title>Second-Generation Planet Formation in Post-AGB Discs: Testing the Role of Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binary stars are evolved systems that host circumbinary discs formed through mass loss during late-stage binary interaction. Their structural, kinematic, and chemical similarities to planet-forming discs have motivated the idea that these systems may act as sites of "second-generation" planet formation. In this study, we assess whether the gravitational instability mechanism - a proposed pathway for giant planet formation in some protoplanetary discs-can operate in post-AGB discs. Using the Toomre criterion under well-motivated assumptions for disc structure and size, mass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational instability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using several well-studied protoplanetary disc systems before applying the same analysis to observed post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally gravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. The disks were stable against collapse, even when accounting for potentially higher disk mass in the past. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the same way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases early on. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the post-common envelope system NN Serpentis first carried out by Schleicher and Dreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under specific, high disc mass assumptions, however we note that their proposed disc mass is unlikely. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical assessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that this mechanism is unlikely to dominate second-generation planet formation in these systems, and underscoring the need to explore alternative pathways-such as core accretion-in future studies</description>

      <title>A Full-Atmosphere Model of Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a combined 1D photochemical-thermochemical kinetics model of Jupiter's deeper atmosphere, troposphere and stratosphere. The model covers atmospheric pressure range from $1.1 \times 10^{3}$ bar to $7.4 \times 10^{-11}$ bar and is the first model that incorporates sulfur chemistry when spanning an atmospheric region of this extent. This model incorporates a new version of the STAND reaction network with updated NH4SH chemistry, and updated Antoine equation parameters for NH4SH and H2S. Validation against current models of Jupiter's atmosphere as well as recent observational data shows that our model successfully describes Jupiter's main observed chemical features. Since one of the focuses of the model is the chemistry on nitrogen, it correctly predicts the formation of a mixed NH3-NH4SH cloud layer between 0.1 and 1 bar. It also describes the chemistry of HCN throughout the atmosphere and discovers a region in the stratosphere between $1 \times 10^{-6}$ and $6.76 \times 10^{-8}$ bar, where HCN forms through radical chemistry with maximum mixing ratio 33 ppb at $2.94 \times 10^{-7}$ bar -- a prediction testable by observations. At the same time, our model predicts a quenched N2 mixing ratio 490 ppm up to 10$^{-6}$ bar. The model therefore successfully bridges the gap between existing models of separate regions of Jupiter's atmosphere and makes new testable predictions of several chemical species.</description>

      <title>Stellar occultations in support of the LUMIO orbit determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of stellar occultation measurements to enhance the orbit determination performance of the Lunar Meteoroid Impact Observer (LUMIO) mission, operating from a quasi-Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon L2 point. During science phases, when radiometric tracking is sparse and low illumination limits conventional optical navigation methods, occultation events, defined as precise timings of stellar appearances/disappearances behind the Moon's limb, offer a suitable alternative. A simulation tool based on JPL's MONTE library was developed to identify valid occultation events, applying geometric and illumination constraints to exclude non-observable cases. These events were integrated into a batch least-squares orbit determination filter alongside conventional radiometric data. The covariance analysis shows that occultation observables reduce the transverse and normal position uncertainties of LUMIO by up to a factor of two, especially during tracking gaps or occultation-rich arcs. This uncertainty reduction is expected to facilitate station-keeping operations and constrain the surface localization of Lunar Impact Flashes (LIFs), enhancing the mission's scientific return. Sensitivity analyses confirm that the orbit determination performance is primarily driven by the timing accuracy of occultation events, with limited dependence on lunar shape uncertainty below 100 m. These findings confirm the potential of occultation-based navigation to enhance spacecraft autonomy and robustness in low-visibility environments, making it a valuable complement to radiometric techniques for future lunar and deep-space missions.</description>

      <title>How two-dimensional are planet--disc interactions? I. Locally isothermal discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet--disc interactions, despite being fundamentally three-dimensional, are often studied in the two-dimensional `thin-disk' approximation. The overall morphology of planet--disc interactions has ben shown to be similar in both 2D and 3D simulations, however, the ability of a 2D simulation to quantitatively match 3D results depends strongly on how the potential of the planet is handled. Typically, the 2D planetary potential is smoothed out using some `smoothing length', a free parameter, for which different values have been proposed, depending on the particular aspect of the interaction focused on. In this paper, we re-derive 2D Navier--Stokes in detail for planet--disc interactions to find better ways to represent the 2D gravitational force. We perform a large suite of 2D and 3D simulations to test these force prescriptions. We identify the parts of the interaction that are fundamentally 3D, and test how well our new force prescriptions, as well as traditional smoothed potentials, are able to match 3D simulations. Overall, we find that the optimal way to represent the planetary potential is the `Bessel-type potential', but that even in this case 2D simulations are unable to reproduce the correct scaling of the total torque with background gradients, and are at best able match the one-sided Lindblad torque and gap widths to level of 10 per cent. We find that analysis of observed gap structures based on standard 2D simulations may systematically underestimate planetary masses by a factor of two, and discuss the impacts of 3D effects on observations of velocity kinks.</description>

      <title>The changing transit shape of TOI-3884 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-3884 b is a sub-Saturn transiting a fully convective M-dwarf. Observations indicate that the transit shape is chromatic and asymmetric as a result of persistent starspot crossings. This, along with the lack of photometric variability of the host star, indicates that the rotational axis of the star is tilted along our line of sight and the planet-occulted starspot is located close to the stellar pole. We acquired photometric transits over a period of three years with the Swiss 1.2-meter Euler telescope to track changes in the starspot configuration and detect any signs of decay or growth. The shape of the transit changes over time, and so far no two observations match perfectly. We conclude that the observed variability is likely not caused by changes in the temperature and size of the spot, but due to a slight (5.64 $\pm$ 0.64$^{\circ}$) misalignment between the spot center and the stellar pole, i.e., a small spin-spot angle ($\Theta$). In addition, we were able to obtain precise measurements of the sky-projected spin-orbit angle ($\lambda$) of 37.3 $\pm$ 1.5\degree, and the true spin-orbit angle ($\psi$) of 54.3 $\pm$ 1.4\degree. The precise alignment measurements along with future atmospheric characterisation with the James Webb Space Telescope will be vital for understanding the formation and evolution of close-in, massive planets around fully convective stars.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Perspective on the (Unremarkable) Relative Refractory Depletion Observed in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, the Sun has been observed to be depleted in refractory elements as a function of elemental condensation temperature (\tcond) relative to $\sim 80\%$ of its counterparts. We assess the impact of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) on refractory element--\tcond\ trends for 109,500 unique solar analogs from the GALAH, APOGEE, Gaia RVS, and \cite{bedell18} surveys. We find that a star's \feh\ and \alphafe\ are indicators of its \tcond\ slope (\rsq\ = $15 \pm 5$, $23 \pm 10\%$ respectively) while \teff\ and \logg\ contribute more weakly (\rsq\ = $9 \pm 5$, $13 \pm 16\%$). The Sun's abundance pattern resembles that of more metal-rich (0.1 dex) and $\alpha$-depleted stars ($-0.02$ dex), suggesting a connection to broader GCE trends. To more accurately model stars' nucleosynthetic signatures, we apply the K-process model from \cite{Griffith24}, which casts each star's abundance pattern as a linear combination of core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae contributions. We find the Sun appears chemically ordinary in this framework, lying within $0.5\sigma$ of the expected solar analog abundance distribution. We show that refractory element--\tcond\ trends arise because elements with higher \tcond\ have higher contributions from core-collapse supernovae. Refractory element depletion trends primarily reflect nucleosynthetic enrichment patterns shaped by GCE and local ISM inhomogeneities, with these processes accounting for $93\%$ of the observed variation within 2$\sigma$. This work highlights how abundance diversity due to local and global chemical enrichment may often mask and mimic population-scale signatures of planet-related processes.</description>

      <title>Exoplanetary atmospheres retrieval via a quantum extreme learning machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Weakened Magnetic Braking Signals the Collapse of the Global Stellar Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakened magnetic braking (WMB) was originally proposed in 2016 to explain anomalously rapid rotation in old field stars observed by the Kepler mission. The proximate cause was suggested to be a transition in magnetic morphology from larger to smaller spatial scales. In a series of papers over the past five years, we have collected spectropolarimetric measurements to constrain the large-scale magnetic fields for a sample of stars spanning this transition, including a range of spectral types from late F to early K. During this time, we gradually improved our methods for estimating the wind braking torque in each of our targets, and for evaluating the associated uncertainties. Here, we reanalyze the entire sample with a focus on uniformity for the relevant observational inputs. We supplement the sample with two additional active stars to provide more context for the evolution of wind braking torque with stellar Rossby number (Ro). The results demonstrate unambiguously that standard spin-down models can reproduce the evolution of wind braking torque for active stars, but WMB is required to explain the subsequent abrupt decrease in torque as Ro approaches a critical value for dynamo excitation. This transition is seen in both the large-scale magnetic field and the X-ray luminosity, indicating weakened coronal heating. We interpret these transitions as evidence of a rotational threshold for the influence of Coriolis forces on global convective patterns and the resulting inefficiency of the global stellar dynamo.</description>

Abstract: Classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) exhibit strong variability over timescales of minutes to decades. However, much theoretical work assumes that CTTS are in stable spin states. Here, we test expectations for CTTS angular momentum regulation by comparing star and disk rotation. We measure stellar rotation periods and disk corotation radii ($R_{\rm co}$) for 47 CTTS from the HST ULLYSES sample. We compare $R_{\rm co}$ to the magnetospheric truncation radii ($R_{\rm i}$) and show that most CTTS are in the spin-up regime based on model predictions, which may indicate efficient angular momentum loss processes. We find evidence of magnetospheric outflows and episodic accretion, and our observations are consistent with the presence of accretion-powered stellar winds. We confirm predictions that $R_{\rm i}$ is variable over timescales of days, causing some CTTS to cross accretion stability regime boundaries. We characterize light curve morphologies and confirm that our inclined CTTS with $R_{\rm i}\sim R_{\rm co}$ show dipper light curves, consistent with expectations from disk warp models. However, dippers occur at all values of $R_{\rm i}/R_{\rm co}$, suggesting that they do not need to be near the propeller regime. Finally, we show that our measured $R_{\rm i}$ locations are consistent with observed ultra-short-period planet (USP) semi-major axes. If USPs are stable against tidal dissipation, as has been suggested in the literature, then our work provides a plausible USP formation channel. These results show that the star-disk connection produces a large variety of accretion and stellar spin configurations, most of which are likely not in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Single-shot focal plane wavefront sensing with the spatially-clipped self-coherent camera</title>

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory requires active speckle suppression to directly image Earth-like exoplanets. Focal plane wavefront sensing and control allows us to detect, and subsequently remove, time-varying speckles through measurements of the electric field. Two measurement-based wavefront sensing approaches are pairwise probing (PWP) and the self-coherent camera (SCC). However, the PWP technique is time-consuming, requiring at least 4 images and reducing the speed at which aberrations can be eliminated. In the SCC, a coronagraph mask diffracts light outside of the Lyot stop, where it is filtered with a pinhole. The filtered light creates a reference beam, interfering with speckles that leak through the coronagraph. The classic implementation of the SCC only works over small spectral bandwidths and needs significantly oversized optics which limits its implementation. We propose a new variant, the Spatially-Clipped Self-Coherent Camera (SCSCC). The SCSCC utilizes a pinhole placed closer to the Lyot Stop, reducing the overall beam footprint and boosting the sensor resolution. A knife-edge beam splitter downstream of the Lyot Stop splits the light into two channels: fringed and unfringed. This allows us to sense the wavefront with a single exposure. Time-varying aberrations are effectively frozen in place, making them easy to remove. We present monochromatic simulation results of the SCSCC in a sensing and control loop, demonstrating a normalized intensity of ~ 4 * 10^-10 in a 5-20 lambda/D dark hole. We find that wavefront control paired with the SCSCC achieves ~ 50x deeper contrast than that achieved with PWP in a temporally evolving speckle field. Our results make the SCSCC a valuable wavefront sensor concept for the upcoming Habitable World Observatory mission.</description>

      <title>Galactic forcing increases origination of marine microplankton</title>

Abstract: The continuous flux of Galactic cosmic rays that bombard Earth's atmosphere creates ionizing radiation that can damage the DNA of living organisms. While this radiation on Earth is relatively constant in the short term, large and long-scale fluctuations are expected with a period of $\sim 63.5$ million years. As the Solar System moves above or below the Galactic plane during its oscillatory motion about the Galactic center, the Galactic magnetic shielding weakens, allowing more cosmic rays to reach Earth and trigger mutations in organisms. We identify a significant correlation (weighted global p-value: $1.25\times 10^{-4}$, or $3.72\sigma$) between the Solar System's Galactic oscillations and the origination of marine zoo- and phyto-microplankton genera over the Phanerozoic. When we restrict the analysis to time intervals during which all four groups coexisted, a post-trial significance of $4.52\sigma$ emerges. Our findings suggest that changes in biodiversity have been significantly influenced by long-term Galactic forcing.</description>

      <title>A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</description>

      <title>Resonance Capture and Stability Analysis for Planet Pairs under Type I Disk Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for investigating a two-planet system undergoing convergent type I migration in a protoplanetary disk. Our study identifies the conditions for resonant capture and subsequent dynamical stability. By deriving analytical criteria for general $j$:$j-1$ first-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) applicable to planet pairs with arbitrary mass ratios, we validate these predictions through N-body simulations. The key results are demonstrated in $\tau_{\rm m}$-$\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$ plots, where $\tau_{\rm m}$ and $\tau_{e}$ are the timescales of the angular momentum and eccentricity damping, respectively. Specifically, we determine which combinations of orbital damping timescales allow for capture into resonance, showing that too fast migration or too strong eccentricity damping inhibit successful capture. After capture, the subsequent evolution can be classified into three regimes: stable trap, overstable trap and escape. Importantly, resonant capture always remains stable when the inner planet significantly outweighs the outer one. In contrast, when the mass of the inner planet is lower than or comparable to that of the outer planet, the system transitions from the stable to overstable trap, and eventually escapes the resonance, as the relative strength of eccentricity damping to migration ($\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$) decreases.</description>

      <title>Planetary albedo is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere: Implications for sub-Neptune climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy limits that delineate the `habitable zone' for exoplanets depend on a given exoplanet's net planetary albedo (or `Bond albedo'). We here demonstrate that the planetary albedo of an observed exoplanet is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere - the region of the atmosphere that is probed in remote observation. We derive an analytic model to explore how the maximum planetary albedo depends on the above-cloud optical depth and scattering versus absorbing properties, even in the limit of a perfectly reflective grey cloud layer. We apply this framework to sub-Neptune K2-18b, for which a high planetary albedo has recently been invoked to argue for the possibility of maintaining a liquid water ocean surface, despite K2-18b receiving an energy flux from its host star that places it inside of its estimated `habitable zone' inner edge. We use a numerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model to retrieve the albedo of K2-18b based on the observational constraints from the above-cloud atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that K2-18b's observed transmission spectrum already restricts its possible planetary albedo to values below the threshold required to be potentially habitable, with the data favouring a median planetary albedo of 0.17-0.18. Our results thus reveal that currently characteriseable sub-Neptunes are likely to be magma-ocean or gas-dwarf worlds. The methods that we present are generally applicable to constrain the planetary albedo of any exoplanet with measurements of its observable atmosphere, enabling the quantification of potential exoplanet habitability with current observational capabilities.</description>

      <title>K2-18b Does Not Meet The Standards of Evidence For Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K2-18b, a temperate sub-Neptune, has garnered significant attention due to claims of possible biosignatures in its atmosphere. Low-confidence detections of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) have sparked considerable debate, primarily around arguments that their absorption features are not uniquely identifiable. Here, we consider all five questions from the astrobiology standards of evidence framework, starting with: Have we detected an authentic signal? To answer this, we analyzed publicly-available JWST observations of K2-18b using independent data reduction and spectral retrieval methodologies. Our comprehensive set of reductions demonstrates that the MIRI transit spectrum is highly susceptible to unresolved instrumental systematics. Applying different wavelength binning schemes yields a potpourri of planet spectra that then lead to a wide assortment of atmospheric interpretations. Consequently, we offer recommendations to help minimize this previously-underappreciated instrument systematic in future MIRI reductions of any exoplanet. While the MIRI binning scheme adopted by Madhusudhan et al. (2025) favors the presence of DMS/DMDS in K2-18b, we find that 87.5% of retrievals using our preferred MIRI binning scheme do not. When considering the full, 0.7 - 12 micron transit spectrum, we confirm the detection of CH4 and favor CO2, and find the presence of DMS and C2H4 to be interchangeable. Moreover, we find that the tentative presence of large features in the MIRI transit spectrum is in tension with the more robust, yet smaller, features observed in the near IR. We conclude that red noise -- rather than an astrophysical signal -- plagues the mid-IR data and there is, as yet, no statistically significant evidence for biosignatures in the atmosphere of K2-18b.</description>
