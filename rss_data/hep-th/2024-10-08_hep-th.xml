      <title>Interpolation of rational functions in loop calculations by using p-adic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation and manipulation of large multi-variable rational functions is a key bottleneck in multi-loop calculations. In these conference proceedings, based on my article [Chawdhry (2023) arXiv:2312.03672], I present a technique to interpolate such rational functions in a compact form by evaluating them at special integer points chosen for their properties under a $p$-adic absolute value. I apply the technique to examples of large rational functions appearing in 2-loop 5-point massless non-planar amplitude calculations in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The number of required numerical probes (per field) is found to be around 25 times smaller than in conventional techniques, and the obtained result is 130 times smaller.</description>

      <title>Nonassicative cosmological solitonic R-flux deformations in gauge gravity and G. Perelman geometric flow thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on a model of nonassociative and noncommutative gauge gravity for the de Sitter gauge group $SO(4,1)$ embedding extensions of the affine structure group $Af(4,1)$ and the Poincar\'{e} group $ISO(3,1)$. In string theory, such nonassociative gauge gravity theories are determined by star product R-flux deformations. They are new avenues to quantum gravity and geometric and quantum information theories. We analyze physically important and geometric thermodynamic properties of new classes of generic off-diagonal cosmological solitonic solutions encoding nonassociative effective sources. Particularly, we focus on modelling by such solutions of locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous dark matter and dark energy structures generated as nonassociative solitonic hierarchies. Such accelerating cosmological evolution scenarios can't be described in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic formalism. This motivates a change in the gravitational thermodynamic paradigm by considering nonassociative and relativistic generalizations of the concept of W-entropy in the theory of Ricci flows. Finally, we compute the corresponding modified G. Perelman's thermodynamic variables and analyze the temperature-like evolution of cosmological constants determined by nonassociative cosmological flows.</description>

      <title>Dirac Operators on Configuration Spaces and Yang-Mills Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell systems and R-flux modified Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on a model of nonassociative and noncommutative Einstein--Dirac-Maxwell, EDM, theory determined by star product R-flux deformations in string theory. Solutions for nonassociative EDM systems and physical properties not studied in modern physics. For modifications of the four-dimensional, 4-d, Einstein gravity, we work on conventional nonassociative 8-d phase spaces modelled as star-deformed co-tangent Lorentz bundles. Generalizing the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method, the nonassociative EDM equations are decoupled and integrated in exact and parametric quasi-stationary forms. Corresponding generic off-diagonal metrics are described by nonlinear symmetries and encode nonassociative effective sources and generating functions depending on space and momentum-like coordinates. For respective nonholonomic parameterizations, such solutions describe nonassociative deformations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes. A variant of nonassociative phase space wormhole solution with fermions possessing anisotropic polarized masses is also analyzed. We conclude that such phase space physical objects can't be characterized using the concept of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and show how to compute another type (modified G. Perelman ones) nonassociative geometric and statistical thermodynamic variables.</description>

      <title>Fusions and Dualities for 3d Theories $T[M_3]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 3d theories determined by three-manifolds. Previously, we found that some basic 3d dualities relate to the surgeries of three-manifolds and defined gauge circles and matter circles. In this note, we discuss some operations including handle slides, gaugings and flips of mass parameters, and the corresponding geometric interpretations for these operations. We note that a fusion identity could describe the fusion, or in other words, the connected sum of matter circles. Many abelian dualities could arise from this fusion and inherit geometric interpretations thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a bootstrap method that combines Schwinger-Dyson equations, thermal inequalities, and semidefinite relaxations of matrix logarithm in the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, at finite rank N as well as in the large N limit, and determine finite temperature observables that interpolate between available analytic results in the low and high temperature limits respectively. We also obtain bootstrap bounds on thermal phase transition as well as preliminary results in the ungauged two-matrix quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Twisted compactifications and conformal defects from ISO(3)xU(1) F(4) gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study holographic solutions describing RG flows across dimensions from five-dimensional $N=2$ SCFT to SCFTs in three and two dimensions using matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity with $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. By performing topological twists implemented by $SO(2)$, $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ and $SO(3)$ gauge fields, we find a number of $AdS_4\times H^2$ and $AdS_3\times H^3$ preserving eight and four supercharges. These geometries are identified with conformal fixed points in three and two dimensions, respectively. The corresponding flow solutions are obtained numerically and can be interpreted as black membranes and black strings in asymptotically $AdS_6$ space. In addition, we have constructed charged domain wall solutions with $AdS_2\times S^3$ and $AdS_3\times S^2$ slicing. These solutions are supported by a non-vanishing two-form field and describe conformal line and surface defects within the $N=2$ SCFT in five dimensions, respectively. All of these solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory via consistent truncations on $S^2\times \Sigma$ with $\Sigma$ being a Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>Information Scrambling with Higher-Form Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved operator for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved operators corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic `in' and `out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOC have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a correspondence between the PSSY model and the IOP matrix model by comparing their Schwinger-Dyson equations, Feynman diagrams, and parameters. Applying this correspondence, we resum specific non-planar diagrams involving crossing in the PSSY model by using a non-planar analysis of a two-point function in the IOP matrix model. We also compare them with Page's formula on entanglement entropy and discuss the contributions of extra-handle-in-bulk diagrams.</description>

      <title>Non-toric brane webs, Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and 5d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study webs of 5-branes with 7-branes in Type IIB string theory from a geometric perspective. To any such a web $W$, we attach a log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with a line bundle $L$. We then describe supersymmetric webs, which are webs defining 5d superconformal field theories (SCFTs), in terms of the geometry of $(Y,D,L)$. We also introduce particular supersymmetric webs called "consistent webs", and show that any 5d SCFT defined by a supersymmetric web can be obtained from a consistent web by adding free hypermultiplets. Using birational geometry of degenerations of log Calabi-Yau surfaces, we provide an algorithm to test the consistency of a web in terms of its dual polygon. Moreover, for a consistent web $W$, we provide an algebro-geometric construction of the mirror $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ to $(Y,D,L)$, as a non-toric canonical 3-fold singularity, and show that M-theory on $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ engineers the same 5d SCFT as $W$. We also explain how to derive explicit equations for $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ using scattering diagrams, encoding disk worldsheet instantons in the A-model, or equivalently the BPS states of an auxiliary rank one 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau Yang theorem is well known for the past several decades. It prohibits decay of a massive spin 1 particle to two photons. This emerges simply from the representation theory of the Poincare group and Bose Statistics. It does not require any action or Lagrangian. We generalize this theorem to theories with supersymmetry (SUSY) which disallows even decay to two photinos (Majorana fermions). We will prove that if the photon has a mass, howsoever small, this theorem can be evaded. We also show that the supersymmetric selection rule above can also be evaded through the Stueckelberg mass term. Further interesting implications are also pointed out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently introduced a recursive bootstrap method for constructing $n$-point gluon and graviton Mellin-momentum amplitudes in (A)dS spacetime. The power of this approach was illustrated by our successful computation of the first five-point graviton amplitude in (A)dS. In this work, we provide further details of these calculations and start with a more in-depth review of the formalism by offering detailed insights into the motivation for defining on-shell amplitudes in AdS, along with various explicit examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate how cosmological correlators can be effortlessly obtained once the amplitude is determined.</description>

      <title>The underlying black hole phase transitions in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a holographic critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model exhibits a first-order phase transition curve that terminates at a holographic critical endpoint, offering intriguing insights into the phase diagram of the dual system living on the boundary. However, the specific instability within the underlying spacetime that triggers the formation of the hairy black hole remains somewhat obscure. This raises the question of whether one of the hairy black hole phases represents a superconducting or scalarized state and how the two distinct phases merge into a indistinguishable one at the critical point. This work investigates the associated black hole phase transition and the underlying instabilities by exploring a specific Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model. The approach aims to provide transparent insights into the black hole phase transitions in the bulk. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between a massive real scalar field and a Maxwell field in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, we identify two types of scalarization corresponding to tachyonic instabilities in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. These distinct instabilities lead to a first-order phase transition between two phases in the $\mu-T$ phase diagram. Furthermore, this first-order transition terminates at a critical point, beyond which the curve turns back, and the transition becomes a numerically elusive third-order one. Although one does not encounter a critical endpoint, the model still offers a consistent interpretation for the observed {\it cross-over} in the low baryon density region. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the scalarized hairy black holes and discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>On two approaches to quantization in strong background fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two ways to quantize free (gaussian) theory in strong background fields. In one of them, which we refer to as the Heisenberg approach, the mode functions are defined once and for entire space-time. In this approach there is no any apparent presence of an initial Cauchy surface. Another method, which we refer to as the Schrodinger approach, assumes the presence of the initial Cauchy surface on which one defines a spatial basis of modes and only then considers the evolution of the creation and annihilation operators in time with the use of the (free) Hamiltonian. The first method usually used to respect the symmetries of the problem (e.g. isometry of the de Sitter space-time), while in the second method the isometry is apparently broken by the presence of the initial Cauchy surface. In this paper we compare the two methods of quantization and find conditions under which they give the same result.</description>

Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons on a Bose-Einstein condensate has been explored in (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 026014; https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.026014). In the previous paper, we investigated the effects of graviton while detecting a gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this work we shall explicitly calculate the decoherence due to the noise of gravitons between two momentum states of the Bose-Einstein condensate. This decoherence happens due to Bremsstrahlung from the Bose-Einstein condensates due to the effect of the noise induced by gravitons. It is also observed that the two states become entangled because of the existence of a surrounding graviton field which degrades over time via means of this gravitational Bremsstrahlung. Using this property of the Bose-Einstein condensate in a quantum gravity background, we propose an experimental test via the use of atom lasers (generated from the condensate) which would, in principle, help to detect gravitons in future generations of very advanced ultra-cold temperature experiments.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Modular Spread Complexity for Non-Hermitian Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we generalize the concept of modular spread complexity to the cases where the reduced density matrix is non-Hermitian. This notion of complexity and associated Lanczos coefficients contain richer information than the pseudo-entropy, which turns out to be one of the first Lanczos coefficients. We also define the quantity pseudo-capacity which generalizes capacity of entanglement, and corresponds to the early modular-time measure of pseudo-modular complexity. We describe how pseudo-modular complexity can be calculated using a slightly modified bi-Lanczos algorithm. Alternatively, the (complex) Lanczos coefficients can also be obtained from the analytic expression of the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy, which can then be used to calculate the pseudo-modular spread complexity. We show some analytical calculations for 2-level systems and 4-qubit models and then do numerical investigations on the quantum phase transition of transverse field Ising model, from the (pseudo) modular spread complexity perspective. As the final example, we consider the $3d$ Chern-Simon gauge theory with Wilson loops to understand the role of topology on modular complexity. The concept of pseudo-modular complexity introduced here can be a useful tool for understanding phases and phase transitions in quantum many body systems, quantum field theories and holography.</description>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Nonmetric geometric flows and quasicrystalline topological phases for dark energy and dark matter in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on nonmetric geometric flow theory and metric-affine gravity with applications in modern cosmology. Two main motivations for our research follow from the facts that 1) cosmological models for $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, MGTs, are efficient for describing recent observational data provided by the James Webb Space Telescope; and 2) the statistical thermodynamic properties of such nonmetric locally anisotropic cosmological models can be studied using generalizations of the concept of G. Perelman entropy. We derive nonmetric distorted R. Hamilton and Ricci soliton equations in such canonical nonholonomic variables when corresponding systems of nonlinear PDEs can be decoupled and integrated in general off-diagonal forms. This is possible if we develop and apply the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method involving corresponding types of generating functions and generating sources encoding nonmetric distortions. Using such generic off-diagonal solutions (when the coefficients of metrics and connections may depend generically on all spacetime coordinates), we model accelerating cosmological scenarios with quasi-periodic gravitational and (effective) matter fields; and study topological and nonlinear geometric properties of respective dark energy and dark matter, DE and DM, models. As explicit examples, we analyze some classes of nonlinear symmetries defining topological quasicrystal, QC, phases which can modified to generate other types of quasi-periodic and locally anisotropic structures. The conditions when such nonlinear systems possess a behaviour which is similar to that of the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario are stated. We conclude that nonmetric geometric and cosmological flows can be considered as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM concordance models and speculate on how such theories can be elaborated.</description>

      <title>Unearthing Neutrino Decoherence from Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the influence of \(\kappa\) Minkowski-type quantum spacetime on neutrino oscillations, revealing that spacetime fluctuations introduce a unique energy-dependent power law, \(E^{-4}\), in the decoherence effect for relic neutrinos. This effect is particularly pronounced for low-energy neutrinos, such as those from the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results indicate the potential for new models of low-energy quantum gravity-induced decoherence, which could pave the way for future experiments, such as IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT, to further constrain the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Axion Couplings in Heterotic String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the coupling of axions to gauge bosons in heterotic string theory. The axion-gauge boson couplings in the low energy 4d theory are derived by matching mixed anomalies between higher-form global symmetries and the zero-form gauge symmetry in the 10d theory. When the standard model gauge group is embedded in a single simple group in the 10d theory -- as is the case for almost all heterotic models studied in the literature -- the ratio of the axion-photon coupling to the axion mass is bounded above by the QCD line. This bound is relevant for a large number of axion searches which have sensitivity to axion parameter space above this line. The discovery of an axion in these searches will rule out a large class of heterotic models, making such a signal challenging to explain within heterotic string theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Particle Production of Scalars: Analytic and Numerical Approaches Including Early Reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) is a generic mechanism by which particles are produced during the inflationary epoch. In this work we consider the GPP of massive scalars in an effort to fully understand the spectrum of the produced particles. We consider scalars which are conformally or minimally coupled to gravity, as well as models of both early and late reheating. We numerically calculate the particle production in each scenario and compare the results to analytic approximations from boundary matching, Stokes phenomenon, steepest descent, and inflaton scattering methods. For each method, we describe the regime of validity and show that there is good agreement between the analytic and numerical results.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Scenario in the $f(T)$ Modified Gravity Model with Dynamical System Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $f(T)$ gravity, the theory modifies the gravitational action by introducing a function of the torsion scalar $T$. This approach allows for a different treatment of gravity than general relativity, particularly in cosmological contexts. Dynamical system analysis is a powerful tool for exploring the stability and behavior of cosmological solutions within this framework. The dynamical system analysis involves examining the phase space of the cosmological equations derived from the $f(T)$ model. This analysis helps identify fixed points, stability, and the evolution of the universe's scale factor. Therefore, in the following, we first review the main equations of the $f(T)$ gravity model. Then we study the dynamic analysis of the gravity model and obtain stability points. Finally, we consider the bouncing scenario in this model.</description>

      <title>Kubo formula for spin hydrodynamics: spin chemical potential as leading order in gradient expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-order dissipative spin hydrodynamic framework, where the spin chemical potential $\omega^{\mu\nu}$ is treated as the leading term in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion, i.e., $\omega^{\mu\nu}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. We argue that for the consistency of the theoretical framework, the energy-momentum tensor needs to be symmetric at least up to order $\mathcal{O}(\partial)$. We consider the phenomenological form of the spin tensor, where it is anti-symmetric in the last two indices only. A comprehensive analysis of spin hydrodynamics is conducted using both macroscopic entropy current analysis and microscopic Kubo formalism, establishing consistency between the two approaches. A key finding is the entropy production resulting from spin-orbit coupling, which alters the traditional equivalence between the Landau and Eckart fluid frames. Additionally, we identify cross-diffusion effects, where vector dissipative currents are influenced by gradients of both spin chemical potential and chemical potential corresponding to the conserved charge through off-diagonal transport coefficients. Two distinct methods for decomposing the spin tensor are proposed, and their equivalence is demonstrated through Kubo relations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a newly constructed black hole coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper finds an exact singular black hole solution in the presence of nonlinear electrodynamics as the source of matter field surrounded by a cloud of strings in $4D$ $AdS$ spacetime. Here, the presence of the cloud of string, the usual Bardeen solution, becomes singular. The obtained black hole solution interpolates with the $AdS$ Letelier black hole in the absence of both the deviation parameter and magnetic charge and interpolates with the $AdS$ Bardeen black hole in the absence of the deviation parameter and a cloud of strings parameter. We analyse the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, including the stability of the resulting black hole, numerically and graphically. Thermodynamical quantities associated with the black hole get modified due to the nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings. Moreover, we study the effect of a cloud of strings parameter, magnetic charge and deviation parameter on critical points and phase transition of the obtained black hole where the cosmological constant is treated as the thermodynamics pressure. The critical radius increases with increasing deviation parameter values and magnetic charge values. In contrast, the critical pressure and temperature decrease with increasing deviation parameters and magnetic charge values.</description>

Abstract: We solve the gravitational field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime within the framework of the symmetric teleparallel theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive new solutions within the context of power-law $f(Q)$ gravity and the nonmetricity scalar-tensor theory. For the connection in the non-coincidence gauge, we present the point-like Lagrangian that describes the employed field equations. Furthermore, we construct two conservation laws, and for different values of these conserved quantities, we analytically solve the gravitational field equations. New solutions are obtained, we investigate their physical properties and their general relativistic limit. Finally, we discuss the algebraic properties for the derived spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitons are understood to be the quantum noise of gravitational waves and between two gravitational masses. Supposing a coalescing binary resembles a rotating and contracting volume, the gravitons in an effective thermal gas undergo Brownian motion via interactions with their nearest neighbors. The Einstein-Langevin equation expresses first-order metric pertubations as gravitonic fluctuations; conditioning the equation for a coalescing binary allows a concrete evaluation of quanta dissipation as directly proportional to the third power of osculating eccentricity and inversely proportional to the volume. In addition, conducting Gaussian noise analysis on the conditioned Einstein-Langevin equation via an Euler iteration scheme achieves a simulation of the Brownian motion of gravitons. The produced noise signal from a graviton's Brownian motion closely resembles a GW waveform. "Wolfram Mathematica" coding commands are offered in-text for the reproduction of numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the numerical solutions for spherically symmetric situations in Einstein cubic gravity. In addition to the previously found black hole solutions, we uncover a new class of solutions that lack horizons. Due to the divergence of the central curvature, these solutions represent a novel type of naked singularity. By varying parameters, we find that under certain conditions, the metric function can approach zero infinitely, indicating the emergence of a critical event horizon. These solutions, featuring a critical horizon and obtained solely from pure gravity model, can be described as frozen gravitational stars (FGSs). Additionally, the radius of this horizon is linked to the coupling constant lambda, increasing as lambda increases. Remarkably, from the perspective of an external observer, these solutions closely resemble extreme black holes. Notably, we find that for all values of lambda, the position of this critical horizon coincides with that of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass.</description>

Abstract: We derive the general solution to the coupled Einstein and Dirac field equations in static and hyperplane-symmetric spacetime of arbitrary dimension including a cosmological constant of either sign. As a result, only a massful Dirac field couples via the Einstein equations to spacetime, and in the massless case the Dirac field is required to fulfill appropriate constraints in order to eliminate off-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor. We also give explicit expressions for curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar and the Kretschmann scalar, indicating physical singularities. Moreover, we reduce the general solution of the geodesic equation to quadratures.</description>

      <title>Matter--Geometry interplay in new scalar tensor theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies the possible interplay between matter and geometry in scalar tensor theories of gravitation where the energy--momentum tensor is directly coupled with the Einstein tensor. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the $f(R, G_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, the analysis continue with an approach based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in open systems. To this regard, various thermodynamic properties are directly obtained in this manner, like the matter creation (annihilation) rate and the corresponding creation (annihilation) pressure. In the case of the Roberson--Walker metric several analytic and numerical solutions are found in the asymptotic regime. In the last part of the manuscript a specific parametrization for the Hubble rate is constrained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the case of cosmic chronometers (CC) and BAO observations, obtaining an approximate numerical solution which can describe the cosmological model. For this model, we have obtained by fine--tuning some numerical solutions which exhibit creation mechanisms in different specific regimes.</description>

      <title>Mutual information and correlation measures in holographic RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of mutual information, entanglement negativity, and multipartite correlations in holographic RG flows, particularly during phase transitions. Mutual information provides a UV-finite measure of total correlations between subsystems, while entanglement negativity and multipartite correlations offer finer insights into quantum structures, especially near critical points. Through numerical simulations, we show that while mutual information remains relatively smooth, both entanglement negativity and multipartite correlations exhibit sharp changes near phase transitions. These results support the hypothesis that multipartite correlations play a dominant role in signaling critical phenomena in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Positive Conserved Quantities in the Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an embedding of the Klein-Gordon equation into a pair of coupled equations that are first-order in time. The existence of such an embedding is based on a positivity property exhibited by the Klein-Gordon equation. These coupled equations provide a more satisfactory reduction of the Klein-Gordon equation to first-order differential equations in time than the Schrodinger equation. Using this embedding, we show that the "negative probabilities" associated with the Klein-Gordon equation do not need to be resolved by introducing matrices as Dirac did with his eponymous equation. For the case of the massive Klein-Gordon equation, the coupled equations are equivalent to a forward Schrodinger equation in time and a backward Schrodinger equation in time, respectively, corresponding to a particle and its antiparticle. We show that there are two positive integrals that are conserved (constant in time) in the Klein-Gordon equation and thus provide a concrete resolution of the historical puzzle regarding the previously supposed lack of a probabilistic interpretation for the field governed by the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>STEGR in Internal-Space Formulation: Formalisms, Primary Constraints, and Possible Internal Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate that in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the existence of a massless spinor degrees of freedom in a spacetime with internal boundaries, such as black holes, we show that a topological mechanism naturally induces terms in the Einstein-Cartan gravitational action that can be interpreted as GR with dark energy and some dark fluid. This can alleviate the problems of dark energy, and perhaps of dark matter. The dark fluid term remains to be further analysed. The topological information is carried by a harmonic 1-form associated to the first co-holomology group of the spacetime, which induces a spacetime contortion acting on the horizontal bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelctric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects.</description>

Abstract: In the peculiar manner by which physicists reckon descent, this article is by a "child" and "grandchild" of the late Stanley Deser. We begin by sharing reminiscences of Stanley from over 40 years. Then we turn to a problem which was dear to his heart: the prospect that gravity might nonperturbatively screen its own ultraviolet divergences and those of other theories. After reviewing the original 1960 work by ADM, we describe a cosmological analogue of the problem and then begin the process of implementing it in gravity plus QED.</description>

Abstract: We compute the conservative scattering angle of two classical charged particles at the sixth order in electromagnetic coupling, and at the fourth order in velocity, thereby going beyond the current state of the art [fifth order in coupling, derived by Bern {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{132}, 251601 (2024)]. Our result is obtained by using the electromagnetic version of the Effective One-Body formalism to transfer information from the exact circular binary-charge solution of Schild [Phys. Rev. \textbf{131}, 2762 (1963)] to the post-Lorentzian expansion of the scattering angle.</description>

      <title>Anomalous continuous symmetries and quantum topology of Goldstone modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider systems in which a continuous symmetry $G$, which may be anomalous, is spontaneously broken to an anomaly-free subgroup $H$ such that the effective action for the Goldstone modes contains topologically non-trivial terms. If the original system has trivial $G$ anomaly, it is known that the possible topological terms are fully determined by SPT or SET invariants of the residual $H$ symmetry. Here we address the more general setting in which the $G$ symmetry has an anomaly. We argue that in general, the appropriate concept to consider is the "compatibility relation" between the Goldstone invariants and the $G$ anomaly. In the case where the Goldstone modes can be gapped out to obtain invertible families (i.e. without any topological order), we give an explicit mathematical scheme to construct the desired compatibility relation. We also address the case where gapping out the Goldstone modes leads to a family of topologically ordered states. We discuss several examples including the canonical Thouless pump, the quantum Hall ferromagnet, pumps arising from breaking $\text{U}(1)$ symmetry at the boundary of topological insulators in two and three dimensions, and pumps classified by the higher Chern number.</description>

Abstract: Functional methods and a derivative expansion are employed for laying out a procedure to compute the effective action to any loop order, for scalar fields parametrising an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, while maintaining explicit field-space covariance. In this process, the geometric generalization of the LSZ reduction formula is presented. These results are of use in the characterization of effective field theories for electroweak symmetry breaking and extend a geometric perspective in field space beyond one loop.</description>

      <title>Bulk Reconstruction from Generalized Free Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalized protocol for constructing a dual free bulk theory from any boundary model of generalized free fields (GFFs). To construct the bulk operators, we employ a linear ansatz similar to the Hamilton-Kabat-Liftschytz and Lowe (HKLL) construction. However, unlike the HKLL construction, our protocol relies only on boundary data with no presupposed form for the bulk equations of motion, so our reconstructed bulk is fully emergent. For a (1+1)d bulk, imposing the bulk operator algebra as well as a causal structure is sufficient to determine the bulk operators and dynamics uniquely up to an unimportant local basis choice. We study the bulk construction for several two-sided SYK models with and without coupling between the two sides, and find good agreement with known results in the low-temperature conformal limit. In particular, we find bulk features consistent with the presence of a black hole horizon for the TFD state, and characterize the infalling fermion modes. We are also able to extract bulk quantities such as the curvature and bulk state correlators in terms of boundary quantities. In the presence of coupling between the two SYK models, we are able to observe evidence of the shockwave geometry and the traversable wormhole geometry using the two-sided mutual information between the reconstructed bulk operators. Our results show evidence that features of the geometric bulk can survive away from the low temperature conformal limit. Furthermore, the generality of the protocol allows it to be applied to other boundary theories with no canonical holographic bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study possible hints towards confinement in a Z$_2$-invariant Yukawa system with massless fermions and a real scalar field in the strongly-coupled regime. Using the tools developed for studying non-perturbative physics via Jacobi elliptical functions, for a given but not unique choice of the vacuum state, we find the exact Green's function for the scalar sector so that, after integrating out the scalar degrees of freedom, we are able to recover the low-energy limit of the theory that is a fully non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. We provide an analytical result for the Renormalization Group (RG) running of the self-interaction coupling in the scalar sector and critical indexes in the strongly-coupled regime. In the fermion sector, we provide some clues towards confinement, after deriving the gap equation with the non-local NJL model, a property which is well-known to not emerge in the local limit of this model. We conclude that, for the scalar-Yukawa theory in the non-perturbative domain with our choice of the vacuum state, the fundamental fermions of the theory form bound states and cannot be observed as asymptotic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the entanglement entropy arising from edge-modes in Abelian $p$-form topological field theories in $d$ dimensions on arbitrary spatial topology and across arbitrary entangling surfaces. We find a series of descending area laws plus universal corrections proportional to the Betti numbers of the entangling surface, which can be taken as a higher-dimensional version of the "topological entanglement entropy." Our calculation comes in two flavors: firstly, through an induced edge-mode theory appearing on the regulated entangling surface in a replica path integral and secondly through a more rigorous definition of the entanglement entropy through an extended Hilbert space. Along the way we establish several key results that are of their own merit. We explain how the edge-mode theory is a novel combination of $(p-1)$-form and $(d-p-2)$-form Maxwell theories linked by a chirality condition, in what we coin a "chiral mixed Maxwell theory." We explicitly evaluate the thermal partition function of this theory. Additionally we show that the extended Hilbert space is completely organized into representations of an infinite-dimensional, centrally extended current algebra which naturally generalizes 2d Kac-Moody algebras to arbitrary dimension and topology. We construct the Verma modules and the representation characters of this algebra. Lastly, we connect the two approaches, showing that the thermal partition function of the chiral mixed Maxwell theory is precisely an extended representation character of our current algebra, establishing an exact correspondence of the edge-mode theory and the entanglement spectrum.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the pole-skipping phenomena of finite temperature Yang-Mills theory with quark flavors which is dual to D3-D7 brane systems in bulk. We also consider the external electric field in the boundary field theory which is dual to the world volume electric field on the D7 brane. We will work in the probe limit where the D7 branes do not back-react to the D3 brane background. In this scenario, we decode the characteristic parameters of the chaos namely, Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_{L}$ and butterfly velocity $v_b$ from the pole-skipping points by performing the near effective horizon analysis of the linearised Einstein equations. Unlike pure Yang-Mills, once charged quarks with a background electric field are added into the system, the characteristic parameters of the chaos show non-trivial dependence on the quark mass and external electric field. We have observed that $\lambda_{L}$ and $v_b$ decreases with increasing electric field. We further perform the pole-skipping analysis for the gauge invariant sound, shear, and tensor modes of the perturbation in the bulk and discuss their physical importance in the holographic context.</description>

Abstract: Gauge-invariant quantum fields are constructed in an Abelian power-counting renormalizable gauge theory with both scalar, vector and fermionic matter content. This extends previous results already obtained for the gauge-invariant description of the Higgs mode via a propagating gauge-invariant field. The renormalization of the model is studied in the Algebraic Renormalization approach.
  The decomposition of Slavnov-Taylor identities into separately invariant sectors is analyzed.
  We also comment on some non-renormalizable extensions of the model whose 1-PI Green's functions are the flows of certain differential equations of the homogeneous Euler type, exactly resumming the dependence on a certain set of dim. 6 and dim. 8 derivative operators.
  The latter are identified uniquely by the condition that they span the mass and kinetic terms in the gauge-invariant dynamical fields.
  The construction can be extended to non-Abelian gauge groups.</description>

Abstract: We explore the physics of relativistic gapless phases defined by a mixed anomaly between two generalized conserved currents. The gapless modes can be understood as Goldstone modes arising from the nonlinear realization of (generically higher-form) symmetries arising from these currents. In some cases, the anomaly cannot be reproduced by any local and unitary theory, indicating that the corresponding symmetries are impossible, in the sense that they cannot appear in a Lorentzian physical system. We consider many examples of the general construction. Most notably, we study conformal gravity from this perspective, describing the higher-form symmetries of the linear theory and showing how it can be understood in terms of anomalies. Along the way we clarify some aspects of electric-magnetic duality in linear conformal gravity.</description>

Abstract: In black hole thermodynamics, defining coarse-grained entropy for dynamical black holes has long been a challenge, and various proposals, such as generalized entropy, have been explored. Guided by the AdS/CFT, we introduce a new definition of coarse-grained entropy for a dynamical black hole in Lorentzian Einstein gravity. On each time slice, this entropy is defined as the horizon area of an auxiliary Euclidean black hole that shares the same mass, (angular) momenta, and asymptotic normalizable matter modes with the original Lorentzian solution. The entropy is shown to satisfy a generalized first law and, through holography, the second law as well. Furthermore, by applying this thermodynamics to several Vaidya models in AdS and flat spacetime, we discover a connection between the second law and the null energy condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

Abstract: Time-evolution of the Universe as described by the Friedmann equation can be coupled to equations of motion of matter fields. Quantum effects may be incorporated to improve these classical equations of motion by the renormalization group (RG) running of their couplings. Since temporal and thermal evolutions are linked to each other, astrophysical and cosmological treatments based on zero-temperature RG methods require the extension to finite-temperatures. We propose and explore a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units), where $k_T$ is acting as a running cutoff for thermal fluctuations and the momentum $k$ can be used for the quantum fluctuations. In this approach, the temperature of the expanding Universe is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$ (and not to $k_T$). We show that by this choice dimensionless RG flow equations have no explicit $k$-dependence, as it is convenient. We also discuss how this modified thermal RG is used to handle high-energy divergences of the RG running of the cosmological constant and to "solve the triviality"of the $\phi^4$ model by a thermal phase transition in terms of $\tau$ in $d=4$ Euclidean dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical generation of randomness in Brownian systems as a function of the degree of locality of the Hamiltonian. We first express the trace distance to a unitary design for these systems in terms of an effective equilibrium thermal partition function, and provide a set of conditions that guarantee a linear time to design. We relate the trace distance to design to spectral properties of the time-evolution operator. We apply these considerations to the Brownian $p$-SYK model as a function of the degree of locality $p$. We show that the time to design is linear, with a slope proportional to $1/p$. We corroborate that when $p$ is of order the system size this reproduces the behavior of a completely non-local Brownian model of random matrices. For the random matrix model, we reinterpret these results from the point of view of classical Brownian motion in the unitary manifold. Therefore, we find that the generation of randomness typically persists for exponentially long times in the system size, even for systems governed by highly non-local time-dependent Hamiltonians. We conjecture this to be a general property: there is no efficient way to generate approximate Haar random unitaries dynamically, unless a large degree of fine-tuning is present in the ensemble of time-dependent Hamiltonians. We contrast the slow generation of randomness to the growth of quantum complexity of the time-evolution operator. Using known bounds on circuit complexity for unitary designs, we obtain a lower bound determining that complexity grows at least linearly in time for Brownian systems. We argue that these bounds on circuit complexity are far from tight and that complexity grows at a much faster rate, at least for non-local systems.</description>

      <title>Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Chern-Simons formulation, we investigate higher spin (HS) black holes in AdS$_{3}$ with soft Heisenberg hair and establish linkage with the real forms of the underlying complexified gauge symmetries taken here as $SL(N,C)_{L}\times SL(N,C)_{R}.$ We study the various conserved currents characterizing the HS black flowers (HS-BF) and show that they can be formed of layers indexed by the elements of the centre of the gauge symmetry. This feature follows from requiring the holonomy of the asymptotic gauge connection around the thermal cycle to sit in the centre $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ of the symmetry group. With regard to the compact subgroups of the real forms of the complexified gauge symmetry, we calculate the entropies of the HS-BF and verify that, unless we are considering trivial holonomies, there are no continuous paths joining the HS-BF to the core spin 2 black holes. As explicit illustrations, we give quantum field realisations of the soft Heisenberg hair in terms of bosonic and fermionic primary conformal fields and compute the HS-BF entropy as a function of the number of fermions occupying the ground state of the Heisenberg soft hair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the structure of six-derivative bosonic couplings in heterotic string theory. First, we determine the maximal covariant and Yang-Mills gauge invariant basis, which consists of 801 independent coupling constants. By imposing T-duality constraints on the circular reduction of these terms, we obtain 468 relations between the coupling constants at the six-derivative order and the known couplings at lower derivative orders. Through the use of field redefinitions, we are able to eliminate the remaining 333 coupling constants. Remarkably, we find that the Yang-Mills field strength only appears through the trace of two field strengths or their derivatives. Finally, we perform further field redefinition to rewrite the remaining couplings in a canonical form characterized by 85 independent couplings.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime: loops, dimensional regularization and cutoffs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalar fields in de Sitter spacetime, computed via standard perturbation theory, often exhibit secular growth characterized by time-dependent divergent terms in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing cosmic expansion. It is widely believed that loop corrections further enhance this secular growth. However, in this note, we argue that this is not necessarily the case: Loop corrections can be systematically handled using standard perturbative techniques, such as dimensional regularization, without introducing new $\ln a(t)$ terms. We focus on a canonical massless scalar field $\varphi$ with self-interactions described by a potential $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)$, and analyze correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this framework, infrared divergences can be systematically eliminated with counterterms at each order in perturbation theory, leading to loop-corrected correlation functions that are indistinguishable from their tree-level forms, with no secular growth from loops. Furthermore, adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we explore the role of cutoffs in computing loop corrections within effective field theory and identify the effective potential $\mathcal{V}_{\rm eff}(\varphi)$, which guarantees cutoff-independent observables. We conclude that when infrared comoving cutoffs are used to regularize loop integrals, time-dependent Wilsonian coefficients are necessary to maintain cutoff-free correlation functions. Neglecting this time dependence results in secular growth from loops.</description>

Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction to two dimensions of certain gravitational theories in $D \geq 4$ dimensions at the two-derivative level. It is known that the resulting field equations describe an integrable system in two dimensions which can also be obtained by a dimensional reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four dimensions. We use this relation to construct a single copy prescription for classes of gravitational solutions in Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou coordinates. In contrast with previous proposals, we find that the gauge group of the Yang-Mills single copy carries non-trivial information about the gravitational solution. We illustrate our single copy prescription with various examples that include the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom solution, the Kaluza-Klein rotating attractor solution, the Einstein-Rosen wave solution and the self-dual Kleinian Taub-NUT solution.</description>

Abstract: We have constructed conserved $\mathcal{N}=2$ higher-spin supercurrents for an arbitrary integer spin through the unconstrained superfield formulation of $4D,\, \mathcal{N}=2$ massless higher-spin theories in the harmonic superspace. The obtained supercurrents are gauge-invariant and determine consistent cubic interactions in the \textit{gauge superfield} $\times$ \textit{supercurrent} form for massless spin $\mathbf{s_1}$ and two massless spin $\mathbf{s_2}$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ supermultiplets. Such interactions and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents exist only for $\mathbf{s_1}\geq 2 \mathbf{s_2}$. These supercurrents are the $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric extension of Berends-Burgers-van Dam higher-spin currents and generalize the linearized Bel-Robinson tensor. The relevant $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents can be considered as the descendants of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ principle supercurrent, which has a simple universal structure. An important feature of our outcomes is that, ultimately, all $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents are built from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield strengths, which are constructed from the unconstrained analytical higher-spin prepotentials.</description>

Abstract: The real part of pseudo entropy in conformal field theories is holographically calculated by the area of some extremal spacelike surfaces in the dual dS and AdS spacetimes. We show that the flat-space limit of these curves in three-dimensional (A)dS spacetimes is well defined. We find that if the length of the curves is calculated from the radial coordinate where the retarded time is extremum, then after taking the flat-space limit, the entanglement entropy of the dual theory of three-dimensional flat spacetime is obtained. For dS spacetime, the radial coordinate corresponding to the extremum of retarded time is located inside the cosmological horizon. Our results suggest that on the field theory side, the entanglement entropy in the dual theory of flat spacetimes should be obtained from the ultra-relativistic limit of pseudo entropy in the dual CFT to (A)dS spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have studied various mixed state information theoretic quantities for an excited state of Lifshitz spacetime in $3+1$-dimensions. This geometry is the gravity dual to a class of $2+1$-dimensional quantum field theories having Lifshitz symmetry. We have holographically calculated mutual information, entanglement wedge cross section, entanglement negativity and mutual complexity for strip like subsystems at the boundary. For this we have used the results of holographic entanglement entropy and complexity present in the literature. We first calculate all of these mentioned quantities for the pure state of Lifshitz spacetime. Then we have moved on to calculate all these quantities for excited state of the Lifshitz spacetime. The gravity dual of excited state of Lifshitz systems in field theory can be obtained by applying constant perturbations along the boundary direction. Further, we would like to mention that for the simplicity of calculation we are only considering results up to the first order in perturbation. The change in the obtained holographic information theoretic quantities are then related to entanglement entropy, entanglement pressure, entanglement chemical potential and charge using the stress tensor complex. These relations are analogous to the first law of entanglement thermodynamics given earlier in the literature. All the calculations are carried out for both values of dynamical scaling exponent ($z$) present in the Lifshitz field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Partial Differential Equations for MHV Celestial Amplitudes in Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we continue our study of Liouville theory and celestial amplitudes by deriving a set of partial differential equations governing the $n$-point MHV celestial amplitudes for gluons and gravitons, parametrised by the Liouville coupling constant $b$. These equations provide a systematic framework for computing the perturbative expansion in $b$ of the celestial amplitudes, which are known to reproduce the tree-level MHV $n$-point functions for pure Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity in the semiclassical $b\rightarrow0$ limit. We demonstrate that the $\mathcal{O}(b^{2})$ corrections are logarithmic for both gluons and gravitons. Furthermore, we compute the correction to the celestial operator product expansion (OPE) parametrised by $b^{2}$. In the case of gluons, the resulting deformation of the celestial OPE is shown to be isomorphic to the one-loop correction of the celestial OPE in pure Yang-Mills theory. We then propose that "celestial Liouville theory," extended beyond the semiclassical limit, encodes the one-loop regime of pure Yang-Mills theory. A formally analogous computation is performed for Einstein gravity to ascertain the deformation of the celestial OPE induced by a non-zero Liouville coupling constant. However, as we shall explain, the physical interpretation of this result remains an open problem due to the intricate nature of the loop-corrected holomorphic collinear limit in graviton scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Records from the S-Matrix Marathon: A Timeless History of Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By directly probing the initial conditions of our universe, cosmological surveys offer us a unique observational handle on quantum field theory in curved spacetime with dynamical gravity and might even allow us to glean information about a full theory of quantum gravity. Here we report on recent progress to study the natural observables in the problem, namely cosmological correlators. After setting the stage, we review results from three different approaches. First, we present the in-out formalism as an interesting alternative to the well-known in-in formalism and stress some of its advantages, such as the derivation of recursion relations, correlators cutting rules and a proposal for a de Sitter scattering matrix. Second, we tackle the important open problem of constructing effective theories in curved spacetime, which generally requires an open quantum system approach. Third, we provide an executive summary of general properties of the field-theoretic wavefunction that follow from symmetries, unitarity, causality and locality. We describe how these properties can be leveraged to bootstrap all tree-level results and we discuss loop contributions.
  These notes are based on a series of lectures held during the S-Matrix Marathon workshop at the Institute for Advanced Study on 11-22 March 2024.</description>

      <title>Superfield twist-$2$ operators in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SCFTs and their renormalization-group improved generating functional in $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SYM theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new construction of superfield collinear twist-$2$ operators as infinite-dimensional, irreducible representations of the collinear superconformal algebra in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. As an application, we realize the above representations in terms of free superfields, in a manifestly gauge-invariant and supersymmetric-covariant fashion, in the zero coupling limit of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. This realization makes manifest their mixing and renormalization properties at one loop. We also extend the techniques in [1-4] to a large class of free superconformal field theories in the superspace formalism. Specifically, we compute the generating functional of superfield twist-2 operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) SYM theory in the zero coupling limit. We also work out in a closed form the corresponding asymptotic renormalization-group improved generating functional in Euclidean superspace. The latter is relevant for the search of the yet-to-come non-perturbative solution of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU($N$) SYM theory.</description>

      <title>Categorical descriptions of one-dimensional gapped phases with Abelian onsite symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the macroscopic observables in the 1+1D gapped phases with Abelian onsite symmetries and show that the spacetime observables for each gapped phase form a clear structure that can be mathematically described by enriched fusion categories, which uncovers the behavior of nonlocal excitations that were blurry in traditional Landau paradigm. These categorical descriptions not only generate the known classification results for symmetry preserving and breaking phases, but also unifies lattice dualities in a broader picture. After analyzing the general lattice model together with their boundaries, we give explicit examples including nontrivial SPT phase, where nontrivial boundaries can be given directly through our classification. Using enriched categorical descriptions, the lattice dualities and their gapped phases are unified under a holographic duality between an 2d. topological order with gapped 1d boundaries and 1+1D gapped quantum liquids with a categorical symmetry, which shed light on a unified definition of all quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Weak Energy Condition and wormholes in Brans-Dicke gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15450v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the formation of a wormhole typically involves a violation of the Weak Energy Condition (WEC), but the reverse is not necessarily true. In the context of Brans-Dicke gravity, the $\textit{generalized}$ Campanelli-Lousto solution, which we shall unveil in this paper, demonstrates a WEC violation that coincides with the appearance of $\textit{unbounded}$ sheets of spacetime within the "interior" section. The emergence of a wormhole in the "exterior" section is thus only an indirect consequence of the WEC violation. Additionally, we use the generalized Campanelli-Lousto solution to construct a Kruskal-Szekeres diagram, which exhibits a "gulf" sandwiched between the four quadrants in the diagram, a novel feature in Brans-Dicke gravity. Overall, our findings shed new light onto a complex interplay between the WEC and wormholes in the Brans-Dicke theory.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian Bianchi identities of metric connections with skew torsion and generalized Ricci solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03986v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvature properties of a metric connection with totally skew-symmetric torsion are investigated. It is shown that if either the 3-form $T$ is harmonic, $dT=\delta T=0$ or the curvature of the torsion connection $R\in S^2\Lambda^2$ then the scalar curvature of a $\nabla$-Einstein manifold is determined by the norm of the torsion up to a constant. It is proved that a compact generalized gradient Ricci soliton with closed torsion is Ricci flat if and only if either the norm of the torsion or the Riemannian scalar curvature are constants. In this case the torsion 3-form is harmonic and the gradient function has to be constant.
  Necessary and sufficient conditions a metric connection with skew torsion to satisfy the Riemannian first Bianchi identity as well as the contracted Riemannian second Binachi identity are presented. It is shown that if the torsion connection satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity then it satisfies the contracted Riemannian second Bianchi identity. It is also proved that a metric connection with skew torsion satisfying the curvature identity $R(X,Y,Z,V)=R(Z,Y,X,V)$ must be flat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvature properties of the characteristic connection on an integrable $G_2$ manifold are investigated. We consider integrable $G_2$ manifold of constant type, i.e. the scalar product of the exterior derivative of the $G_2$ form with its Hodge dual is constant. We show that on an integrable $G_2$ manifold of constant type with $G_2$-instanton characteristic curvature and vanishing Ricci tensor the torsion 3-form is harmonic. Consequently, we prove that the characteristic curvature is symmetric in exchange the first and the second pair and Ricci flat if and only if the three-form torsion is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita and to the characteristic connection simultaneously and this is equivalent to the condition that the characteristic curvature satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity. We find that the Hull connection is a $G_2$-instanton exactly when the torsion is closed. We observe that any compact integrable $G_2$ manifold with closed torsion is a generalized gradient Ricci soliton and this is equivalent to a certain vector field to be parallel with respect to the characteristic connection. In particular, this vector field is an infinitesimal automorphism of the $G_2$ structure.</description>

      <title>Searching for topological dark matter in LIGO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave interferometers have been recently proposed as a promising probe in searches for dark matter. These highly sensitive instruments are potentially able to detect the interactions of dark matter with the detector's hardware. In this work, we explore the possibilities of discovering topological dark matter with the LIGO detectors. We analyze domain walls consisting of dark matter passing through the Earth, leaving traces in multiple detectors simultaneously. Considering dark matter interactions with light in the interferometer, and with the beam splitter, we perform the first analysis of topological dark matter with gravitational-wave strain data. We examine whether astrophysically unexpected triggers could be explained by domain-wall passages. We find that all of the binary black hole mergers we analyze favor the binary black hole merger hypothesis rather than the domain-wall hypothesis, with the closest being GW190521. Moreover, we find that some topological dark matter signals can be caught by binary black hole searches. Finally, we find that special types of glitches in the measurement data can inevitably limit the dark matter searches for certain parameters. These results are expected to guide future searches and analyses.</description>

      <title>Duality and Stacking of Bosonic and Fermionic SPT Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of duality and stacking of bosonic and fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases in one spatial dimension. In general the classifications of bosonic and fermionic phases have different group structures under the operation of stacking, but we argue that they are often isomorphic and give an explicit isomorphism when it exists. This occurs for all unitary symmetry groups and many groups with antiunitary symmetries, which we characterize. We find that this isomorphism is typically not implemented by the Jordan-Wigner transformation, nor is it a consequence of any other duality transformation that falls within the framework of topological holography. Along the way to this conclusion, we recover the fermionic stacking rule in terms of G-pin partition functions, give a gauge-invariant characterization of the twisted group cohomology invariant, and state a procedure for stacking gapped phases in the formalism of symmetry topological field theory.</description>

      <title>Inflation with vector fields revisited: heavy entropy perturbations and primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit inflation coupled with vector fields employing kinetic coupling in the comoving gauge. It is known that there is a cumulative effect $IN^2$ on the curvature power spectrum. For a large number of e-foldings $N$, this contribution is so significant that it could violate observational constraints when the ratio of kinetic energy between the vector fields and the inflaton $I$ is not extremely small. In this paper, we explore a regime where $I\gg 1$. This regime has not been extensively explored due to the limitations of perturbative methods. We found that the entropy perturbation becomes heavy in this regime and the cumulative effect decays away on super-horizon scales. Consequently, the power spectrum retains its scale invariance in the decoupling limit. By straightforwardly integrating out the heavy modes near horizon-crossing, we derive a low-energy effective field theory describing a massless adiabatic perturbation with an imaginary speed of sound $c_s^2= -1/3$. Namely, the inflation with vector fields presents a potential mechanism for generating primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Low-Scale Inflationary Magnetogenesis without Baryon Isocurvature Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetogenesis is an intriguing possibility to explain the origin of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs). However, the baryon isocurvature problem has recently been pointed out, ruling out all magnetogenesis models operating above the electroweak scale. In this letter, we show that lower-scale inflationary scenarios with a Chern-Simons coupling can evade this problem. We propose concrete inflationary models whose reheating temperatures are lower than the electroweak scale and numerically compute the amount of magnetic fields generated during inflation and reheating. We find that, for lower reheating temperatures, the magnetic helicity decreases significantly. It is also possible to generate fully helical magnetic fields by modifying the inflaton potential. In both cases, the produced magnetic fields can be strong enough to explain the observed IGMFs, while avoiding the baryon isocurvature problem.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and butterfly velocity in quantum spin glass chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make lattice generalization of two well-known zero-dimensional models of quantum spin glass, Sachdev-Ye (SY) and spherical quantum $p$-spin glass model, to one dimension for studying crossovers in non-local scrambling dynamics due to glass transition, complex dynamics, and quantum and thermal fluctuations in paramagnetic (PM) and spin glass (SG) phases. In the SY chain of quantum dots, each described by infinite-range random Heisenberg model of $N$ spin-$S$ $SU(M)$ spins, we obtain the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and butterfly velocity $v_B$ as a function of temperature $T$ and the quantum parameter $S$ across the PM-SG phase boundary using a bosonic spinon representation in the large $N,M$ limit. In particular, we extract asymptotic $T$ and $S$ dependence, e.g., power laws, for $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ in different regions deep inside the phases and near the replica symmetry breaking SG transition. We find the chaos to be non-maximal almost over the entire phase diagram. Very similar results for chaos indicators are found for the $p$-spin glass chain as a function of temperature and a suitable quantum parameter $\Gamma$, with some important qualitative differences. In particular, $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ exhibit a maximum, coinciding with onset of complex glassy relaxation, above the glass transition as a function of $T$ and $\Gamma$ in the PM phase of the $p$-spin glass model. In contrast, the maximum is only observed as a function of $S$, but not with temperature, in the PM phase of SY model. The maximum originates from enhanced chaos due to maximal complexity in the glassy landscape. Thus, the results in the SY model indicate very different evolution of glassy complexity with quantum and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow, dualities, and quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge theories induced by measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work [SciPost Phys. 14, 129 (2023)] has demonstrated that quantum simulation of abelian lattice gauge theories (Wegner models including the toric code in a limit) in general dimensions can be achieved by local adaptive measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states with higher-form generalized global symmetries. The entanglement structure of the resource SPT state reflects the geometric structure of the gauge theory. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the anomaly inflow mechanism between the deconfining phase of the simulated gauge theory on the boundary and the SPT state in the bulk, by showing that the anomalous gauge variation of the boundary state obtained by bulk measurement matches that of the bulk theory. Moreover, we construct the resource state and the measurement pattern for the measurement-based quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory with a matter field (Fradkin-Shenker model), where a simple scheme to protect gauge invariance of the simulated state against errors is proposed. We further consider taking an overlap between the wave function of the resource state for lattice gauge theories and that of a parameterized product state, and we derive precise dualities between partition functions with insertion of defects corresponding to gauging higher-form global symmetries, as well as measurement-induced phases where states induced by a partial overlap possess different (symmetry-protected) topological orders. Measurement-assisted operators to dualize quantum Hamiltonians of lattice gauge theories and their non-invertibility are also presented.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Lorentzian quantum cosmology: No-boundary saddles and resummation of quantum gravity corrections around tunneling saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the path-integral approach to the wave function of the Universe by utilizing Lefschetz thimble analyses and resurgence theory. The traditional Euclidean path-integral of gravity has the notorious ambiguity of the direction of Wick rotation. In contrast, the Lorentzian method can be formulated concretely with the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Yet, a challenge remains: the physical parameter space lies on a Stokes line, meaning that the Lefschetz-thimble structure is still unclear. Through complex deformations, we resolve this issue by uniquely identifying the thimble structure. This leads to the tunneling wave function, as opposed to the no-boundary wave function, offering a more rigorous proof of the previous results. Further exploring the parameter space, we discover rich structures: the ambiguity of the Borel resummation of perturbative series around the tunneling saddle points is exactly canceled by the ambiguity of the contributions from no-boundary saddle points. This indicates that resurgence also works in quantum cosmology, particularly in the minisuperspace model.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of first-class constraints and the quantization of gauge theories: from "matter without matter" to the reappearance of time in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make a conceptual overview of a particular approach to the initial-value problem in canonical gauge theories. We stress how the first-class phase-space constraints may be relaxed if we interpret them as fixing the values of new degrees of freedom. This idea goes back to Fock and Stueckelberg, leading to restrictions of the gauge symmetry of a theory, and it corresponds, in certain cases, to promoting constants of Nature to physical fields. Recently, different versions of this formulation have gained considerable attention in the literature, with several independent iterations, particularly in classical and quantum descriptions of gravity, cosmology, and electromagnetism. In particular, in the case of canonical quantum gravity, the Fock--Stueckelberg approach is relevant to the so-called problem of time. Our overview recalls and generalizes the work of Fock and Stueckelberg and its physical interpretation with the aim of conceptually unifying the different iterations of the idea that appear in the literature and of motivating further research.</description>

      <title>New exact solution and $\mathcal{O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly in Brans-Dicke gravity with trace-carrying matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact static spherisymmetric solution for the Brans-Dicke action sourced by a self-gravitating massless Klein-Gordon helicity-0 field. In contrast to the Maxwell electromagnetic field, a Klein-Gordon field possesses an energy-momentum tensor with $\textit{non-vanishing trace}$. Upon a Weyl mapping into the Einstein frame, the transformed Brans-Dicke scalar field takes on the role of a "dilaton" coupled with the Klein-Gordon field. Despite this dilatonic coupling, the field equations of the resulting Einstein-Klein-Gordon-dilaton action are fully soluble when employing the harmonic radial coordinate. The exact solution derived herein can serve as a prototype for future Brans-Dicke gravity studies involving trace-carrying matter fields. Notably, in the limit of infinite $\omega$, the Brans-Dicke scalar field exhibits an anomalous behavior of ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ as opposed to ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$. As a consequence, the solution converges to a spacetime configuration of General Relativity sourced by the original Klein-Gordon field and a free scalar field, the latter of which is the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ "remnant" of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. Furthermore, we provide a formal mathematical proof substantiating these two conclusions. Although the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly has been previously discovered for Brans-Dicke vacuum and Brans-Dicke-Maxwell electrovacuum, our findings establish its prevalence in Brans-Dicke gravity $\textit{regardless}$ of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the source. Taken together, the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly challenges the conventional belief in the ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$ signature commonly associated with Brans-Dicke gravity. In particular, it may have implications in improving the relativistic corrections to Newtonian gravity beyond the weak-field parametrized post-Newtonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Quasiparton distributions in massive QED2: Toward quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quasi-parton distributions of the lightest $\eta'$ meson in massive two-dimensional Quantum electrodynamics (QED2) by performing a digital quantum simulation on a classical computer (exact diagonalization). The Hamiltonian and boost operators are mapped onto spin qubits in a spatial lattice with open boundary conditions. The lowest excited state in the exact diagonalization is shown to interpolate continuously between an anomalous $\eta'$ state at strong coupling,and a non-anomalous heavy meson at weak coupling, with a cusp at the critical point. The boosted $\eta'$ state follows relativistic kinematics but with large deviations in the luminal limit. The spatial quasi-parton distribution function and amplitude for the $\eta'$ state are computed numerically for increasing rapidity both at strong and weak coupling, and compared to the exact light front results. The numerical results from the boosted form of the spatial parton distributions, compare fairly with the inverse Fourier transformation of the luminal parton distributions, derived in the lowest Fock space approximation. Our analysis points out some of the limitations facing the current lattice program for the parton distributions.</description>

      <title>Gauging staggered fermion shift symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Staggered fermion shift symmetries correspond to translations of the fermion field within the unit cell of a hypercubic lattice. They satisfy an algebra and in four Euclidean dimensions can be related to a discrete subgroup of an $SU(4)$ flavor symmetry which plays a crucial role in showing that staggered fermions lead to a theory of four degenerate Dirac fermions in the continuum limit. They are associated with the appearance of certain $Z_2$ valued global parameters. We propose a strategy to try to partially gauge these translation symmetries by allowing these parameters to vary locally in the lattice. To maintain invariance of the action requires the addition of $Z_2$ valued higher form lattice gauge fields. An analogous procedure can be carried out for reduced staggered fermions where the shifts correspond to a discrete subgroup of an $SO(4)$ flavor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D SSH can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Generating QES potentials supporting zero energy normalizable states for an extended class of truncated Calogero Sutherland model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in the search for generating potentials for which the underlying Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solvable, we report in the recent work several situations when a zero-energy state becomes bound depending on certain restrictions on the coupling constants that define the potential. In this regard, we present evidence of the existence of regular zero-energy normalizable solutions for a system of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) potentials that correspond to the rationally extended many-body truncated Calogero-Sutherland (TCS) model. Our procedure is based upon the use of the standard potential group approach with an underlying $so(2, 1)$ structure that utilizes a point canonical transformation with three distinct types of potentials emerging having the same eigenvalues while their common properties are subjected to the evaluation of the relevant wave functions. These cases are treated individually by suitably restricting the coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Spectrum of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy effective theory of a Fermi surface coupled to an Ising-nematic quantum critical point in (2+1) spacetime dimensions with translation symmetry. We formulate the system using the large $N$ Yukawa-SYK model, whose saddle point is described by the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The low-energy physics can be revealed by studying the Gaussian fluctuation spectrum around the saddle point, which is generated by the Bethe-Salpeter kernel $K_\text{BS}$. Based on the Ward identities, we propose an inner product on the space of two point functions, which reveals a large number of soft modes of $K_\text{BS}$. These soft modes parameterize deformation of the Fermi surface, and their fluctuation eigenvalues describe their decay rates. We analytically compute these eigenvalues for a circular Fermi surface, and we discover the odd-parity modes to be parametrically longer-lived than the even-parity modes, due to the kinematic constraint of fermions scattering on a convex FS. The sign of the eigenvalues signals an instability of the Ising-nematic quantum critical point at zero temperature for a convex Fermi surface. At finite temperature, the system can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations of the critical boson. We derive an effective action that describes the soft-mode dynamics, and it leads to a linearized Boltzmann equation, where the real part of the soft-mode eigenvalues can be interpreted as the collision rates. The structure of the effective action is similar to the theory of linear bosonization of a Fermi surface. As an application, we investigate the hydrodynamic transport of non-Fermi liquid. Analyzing the Boltzmann equation, we obtain a conventional hydrodynamic transport regime and a tomographic transport regime. In both regimes, the conductance of the system in finite geometry can be a sharp indicator for the soft-mode dynamics and non-Fermi liquid physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images of the back side of the ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also prove that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic, using the work of Koroteev-Pushkar-Smirnov-Zeitlin describing the latter ring in terms of the Bethe Ansatz equations. Our isomorphism gives a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles described in the quasimap ring.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional QCD at finite density and its 't Hooft-Veneziano limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact solution of one-dimensional lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential is reviewed for the gauge groups $G=Z(N),U(N),SU(N)$ for all values of $N$ and the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Calculated are the partition function, free energy, the Polyakov loop expectation values, baryon density, quark condensate, meson and baryon correlation functions. Detailed analysis of the exact solutions is done for $N=2,3$ with one and two fermion flavors. In the large $N_f$ limit we uncover the Roberge-Weiss phase transition and discuss its remnants at finite $N_f$. In the case of $N_f$ degenerate flavors we also calculate 1) the large $N$ limit, 2) the large $N_f$ limit and 3) the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit of all models. The critical behavior of the models in these limits is studied and the phase structure is described in details. A comparison of all limits with $U(3)$ and $SU(3)$ QCD is also performed. In order to achieve these results we explore several representations of the partition function of one-dimensional QCD obtained and described in the text.</description>
