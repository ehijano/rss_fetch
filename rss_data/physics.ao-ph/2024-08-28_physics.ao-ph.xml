      <title>Towards turbine-location-aware multi-decadal wind power predictions with CMIP6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing amount of renewable energy in the grid, long-term wind power forecasting for multiple decades becomes more critical. In these long-term forecasts, climate data is essential as it allows us to account for climate change. Yet the resolution of climate models is often very coarse. In this paper, we show that by including turbine locations when downscaling with Gaussian Processes, we can generate valuable aggregate wind power predictions despite the low resolution of the CMIP6 climate models. This work is a first step towards multi-decadal turbine-location-aware wind power forecasting using global climate model output.</description>

      <title>The future of offshore wind power production: wake and climate impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid deployment of offshore wind is expected within the coming decades to help meet climate goals. With offshore wind turbine lifetimes of 25-30 years, and new offshore leases spanning 60 years, it is vital to consider long-term changes in potential wind power resource at the farm planning stage. Such changes may arise from multiple sources, including climate change, and increasing wake-induced power losses. In this work, we investigate and compare these two sources of long-term change in wind power, for a case study consisting of 21 wind farms within the German Bight. Consistent with previous studies, we find a small but significant reduction in wind resource due to climate change by the end of the 21st century under the high-emission RCP8.5 scenario, compared with a historical period, with a mean power reduction (over an ensemble of seven climate models) of 2.1%. To assess the impact of wake-induced losses due to increasingly dense farm build-out, we model wakes within the German Bight region using an engineering wake model, under various stages of (planned) build-out corresponding to the years 2010-2027. By identifying clusters of wind farms, we decompose wake effects into long-range (inter-cluster), medium-range (intra-cluster) and short-range (intra-farm) effects. Inter-cluster wake-induced losses increase from 0 for the 2010 scenario to 2.5% for the 2027 scenario, with intra-cluster losses also increasing from 0 to 4.3%. Intra-farm losses are relatively constant, at around 13%. While the evolution of wake effects therefore outweighs the climate effect, and impacts over a shorter timescale, both factors are significant. We also find evidence of non-linear interactions between the climate and wake effects. Both climate change and evolving wake effects must therefore be considered within resource assessment and wind farm planning.</description>

      <title>Mapping global offshore wind resource: wake losses, optimisation potential and climate effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we assess global offshore wind energy resources, wake-induced losses, array layout optimisation potential and climate change impacts. We first map global offshore ambient wind resource from reanalysis data. We estimate wake-induced losses using an engineering wake model, revealing that locations with low (high) resource typically experience larger (smaller) percentage losses. However, we further find that the specific wind speed distribution is important, with narrower distributions generally leading to greater losses. This is due to the overlap between the wind speed distribution and the high-sensitivity region of the turbine thrust and power curves. Broadly, this leads to much stronger wake-induced losses in the tropics (which experience the trade winds) than mid-latitudes. However, the tropics also experience a narrower wind direction distribution; our results demonstrate that this leads to greater potential for mitigation of wake effects via layout optimisation. Finally, we assess projected changes in wind resource and wake losses due to climate change under a high-emission scenario. Many regions are projected to decrease in ambient wind resources, and furthermore these regions will typically experience greater wake-induced losses, exacerbating the climate impact. These results highlight the different challenges and opportunities associated with exploiting offshore wind resources across the globe.</description>

      <title>Efficient fine-tuning of 37-level GraphCast with the Canadian global deterministic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work describes a process for efficiently fine-tuning the GraphCast data-driven forecast model to simulate another analysis system, here the Global Deterministic Prediction System (GDPS) of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Using two years of training data (July 2019 -- December 2021) and 37 GPU-days of computation to tune the 37-level, quarter-degree version of GraphCast, the resulting model significantly outperforms both the unmodified GraphCast and operational forecast, showing significant forecast skill in the troposphere over lead times from 1 to 10 days. This fine-tuning is accomplished through abbreviating DeepMind's original training curriculum for GraphCast, relying on a shorter single-step forecast stage to accomplish the bulk of the adaptation work and consolidating the autoregressive stages into separate 12hr, 1d, 2d, and 3d stages with larger learning rates. Additionally, training over 3d forecasts is split into two sub-steps to conserve host memory while maintaining a strong correlation with training over the full period.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Methane Detection and Quantification from Space - A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methane ($CH_4$) is a potent anthropogenic greenhouse gas, contributing 86 times more to global warming than Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$) over 20 years, and it also acts as an air pollutant. Given its high radiative forcing potential and relatively short atmospheric lifetime (9$\pm$1 years), methane has important implications for climate change, therefore, cutting methane emissions is crucial for effective climate change mitigation. This work expands existing information on operational methane point source detection sensors in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands. It reviews the state-of-the-art for traditional as well as Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The architecture and data used in such ML models will be discussed separately for methane plume segmentation and emission rate estimation. Traditionally, experts rely on labor-intensive manually adjusted methods for methane detection. However, ML approaches offer greater scalability. Our analysis reveals that ML models outperform traditional methods, particularly those based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are based on the U-net and transformer architectures. These ML models extract valuable information from methane-sensitive spectral data, enabling a more accurate detection. Challenges arise when comparing these methods due to variations in data, sensor specifications, and evaluation metrics. To address this, we discuss existing datasets and metrics, providing an overview of available resources and identifying open research problems. Finally, we explore potential future advances in ML, emphasizing approaches for model comparability, large dataset creation, and the European Union's forthcoming methane strategy.</description>
