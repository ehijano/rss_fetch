      <title>Concrete Billiard Arrays of Polynomial Type and Leonard Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d$ denote a nonnegative integer and let $\mathbb{F}$ denote a field. Let $V$ denote a $d+1$ dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}$. Given an ordering $\{\theta_i\}_{i=0}^d$ of the eigenvalues of a multiplicity-free linear map $A: V \to V$, we construct a Concrete Billiard Array $\mathcal{L}$ with the property that for $0 \leq i \leq d$, the $i^{\rm th}$ vector on its bottom border is in the $\theta_i$-eigenspace of $A$. The Concrete Billiard Array $\mathcal{L}$ is said to have polynomial type. We also show the following. Assume that there exists a Leonard system $\Phi=(A;\{E_i\}_{i=0}^d;A^*;\{E_i^*\}_{i=0}^d)$ where $E_i$ is the primitive idempotent of $A$ corresponding to $\theta_i$ for $0 \leq i \leq d$. Then, we show that after a suitable normalization, the left (resp. right) boundary of $\mathcal{L}$ corresponds to the $\Phi$-split (resp. $\Phi^{\Downarrow}$-split) decomposition of $V$.</description>

      <title>Serre duality for dg-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Yekutieli-Zhang's noncommutative Serre Duality Theorem to the setting of noncommutative spaces associated to dg-algebras. As an application, we establish some finiteness properties of derived global sections over such noncommutative spaces. Along the way, we generalize Yekutieli's notion of a balanced dualizing complex to the setting of dg-algebras and establish some cases in which they exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, on one hand, based on the classical perm Yang-Baxter equation, we investigate under what conditions a perm algebra must be a Nijenhuis perm algebra. On the other hand, we derive the compatible conditions between classical perm Yang-Baxter equation and Nijenhuis operator by a class of Nijenhuis perm bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Spaces of triangularizable matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let F be a field. We investigate the greatest possible dimension t_n(F) for a vector space of n-by-n matrices with entries in F and in which every element is triangularizable over the ground field F. It is obvious that t_n(F) is greater than or equal to n(n+1)/2, and we prove that equality holds if and only if F is not quadratically closed or n=1, excluding finite fields with characteristic 2. If F is infinite and not quadratically closed, we give an explicit description of the solutions with the critical dimension t_n(F), reducing the problem to the one of deciding for which integers k between 2 and n all k-by-k symmetric matrices over F are triangularizable.</description>

      <title>Central curves on noncommutative surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exists a dictionary between hereditary orders and smooth stacky curves, resp. tame orders of global dimension 2 and Azumaya algebras on smooth stacky surfaces. We extend this dictionary by explaining how the restriction of a tame order to a curve on the underlying surface corresponds to the fiber product of the curve with the stacky surface. By considering "bad" intersections we can start extending the dictionary in the 1-dimensional case to include non-hereditary orders and singular stacky curves. Two applications of these results are a novel description and classification of noncommutative conics in graded Clifford algebras, giving a geometric proof of results of Hu-Matsuno-Mori, and a complete understanding and classification of skew cubics, generalizing the work of Kanazawa for Fermat skew cubics.</description>

      <title>Eigenvectors of the De Bruijn Graph Laplacian: A Natural Basis for the Cut and Cycle Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Laplacian of the undirected De Bruijn graph over an alphabet $A$ of order $k$. While the eigenvalues of this Laplacian were found in 1998 by Delorme and Tillich [1], an explicit description of its eigenvectors has remained elusive. In this work, we find these eigenvectors in closed form and show that they yield a natural and canonical basis for the cut- and cycle-spaces of De Bruijn graphs. Remarkably, we find that the cycle basis we construct is a basis for the cycle space of both the undirected and the directed De Bruijn graph. This is done by developing an analogue of the Fourier transform on the De Bruijn graph, which acts to diagonalize the Laplacian. Moreover, we show that the cycle-space of De Bruijn graphs, when considering all possible orders of $k$ simultaneously, contains a rich algebraic structure, that of a graded Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Elementary Action of Classical Groups on Unimodular Rows Over Monoid Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elementary action of symplectic and orthogonal groups on unimodular rows of length $2n$ is transitive for $2n \geq \max(4, d+2)$ in the symplectic case, and $2n \geq \max(6, 2d+4)$ in the orthogonal case, over monoid rings $R[M]$, where $R$ is a commutative noetherian ring of dimension $d$, and $M$ is commutative cancellative torsion free monoid. As a consequence, one gets the surjective stabilization bound for the $K_1$ for classical groups. This is an extension of J. Gubeladze's results for linear groups.</description>

      <title>Classification of weak Bruhat interval modules of $0$-Hecke algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak Bruhat interval modules of the $0$-Hecke algebra in type $A$ provide a uniform approach to studying modules associated with noteworthy families of quasisymmetric functions. Recently this kind of modules were generalized from type $A$ to all Coxeter types. In this paper, we give an equivalent description, in a type-independent manner, when two left weak Bruhat intervals in a Coxeter group are descent-preserving isomorphic. As an application, we classify all left weak Bruhat interval modules of $0$-Hecke algebras up to isomorphism, and thereby answer an open question and resolve in the affirmative a conjecture of Jung, Kim, Lee, and Oh. Additionally, for finite Coxeter groups we show that the set of minimum (or maximum) elements of all left weak Bruhat intervals in each descent-preserving isomorphism class forms an interval under the right weak Bruhat order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopf algebroids are generalizations of Hopf algebras to less commutative settings. We show how the comultiplication defined by Kostant and Kumar turns the affine nil Hecke algebra associated to a Coxeter system a into Hopf algebroid without an antipode. The proof relies on mixed dihedral braid relations between Demazure operators and simple reflections. For researchers new to Hopf algebroids we include several additional examples from ring theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we dualize the concept of {\Sigma}-Rickart modules as {\Sigma}-dual Rickart modules. An R-module M is said to be {\Sigma}-dual Rickart if the direct sum of arbitrary copies of M is dual Rickart. We prove that each cohereditary module over the Noetherian ring is a {\Sigma}-dual Rickart. We introduce the notion of strongly cogenerated modules and characterize {\Sigma}-dual Rickart modules in terms of strongly cogenerated modules. We also study some properties of {\Sigma}- dual Rickart modules and find connections with semisimple Artinian ring, regular ring semi-hereditary ring and FP-injective module. Further, we study the endomorphism ring of {\Sigma}-dual Rickart modules</description>

      <title>Extension realizing affine datum: low-dimensional cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For arbitrary varieties of universal algebras, we develop the theory around the first and second-cohomology groups characterizing extensions realizing affine datum. Restricted to varieties with a weak-difference term, extensions realizing affine datum are exactly extensions with abelian kernels. This recovers many classic examples of extensions with abelian coefficients since varieties with a weak-difference term give a far-reaching generalization of algebras like groups with multiple operators; indeed, any variety of algebras whose congruences form modular lattices. We introduce a notion of action and its model relation with a set of equations. In varieties with a difference term, central extensions are characterized by a property of their actions. Restricting further to a subclass of varieties with a difference term which still includes groups with multiple operators, we recover a special case of the representation of extensions with abelian kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the Wells derivation for extensions realizing affine datum in arbitrary varieties; in particular, we show there is an exact sequence connecting the group of compatible automorphisms determined by the datum and the subgroup of automorphisms of an extension which preserves the extension's kernel. This implies a homomorphism between $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-cohomology groups which realizes a group of kernel-preserving automorphisms of an extension as itself an extension of a subgroup of compatible automorphisms by the group of derivations of the datum. A refinement of this general Wells's-type theorem is given for a restricted class of varieties with a difference term which include any variety of groups with multiple operators in the sense of Higgins. The same results are obtained for nonabelian extensions in any variety of $R$-modules expanded by multilinear operations.elf an extension of a subgroup of compatible automorphisms by the group of derivations of the datum.

Abstract: We study the diagonal mappings in non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that, for non-degenerate solutions, they are commuting bijections. This gives the positive answer to the question: ``Is every non-degenerate solution bijective?'' of Ced\'{o}, Jespers and Verwimp. Additionally, we show that for a subclass of solutions called k-permutational, only one-sided non-degeneracy suffices to prove that one of the diagonal mappings is invertible. We also present an equational characterization of multipermutation solutions and extend results of Rump and Gateva-Ivanova about decomposability to non-involutive case. In particular, we show that each, not necessarily involutive, square-free multipermutation solution of finite level and arbitrary cardinality, is always decomposable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute $\delta$-derivations of simple Jordan algebras with values in irreducible bimodules. They turn out to be either ordinary derivations ($\delta = 1$), or scalar multiples of the identity map ($\delta = \frac 12$). This can be considered as a generalization of the "First Whitehead Lemma" for Jordan algebras which claims that all such ordinary derivations are inner. The proof amounts to simple calculations in matrix algebras, or, in the case of Jordan algebras of a symmetric bilinear form, to more elaborated calculations in Clifford algebras.</description>

Abstract: We strengthen the results of Boltje and Yilmaz regarding the Galois descent of equivalences of blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups and a result of Kessar and Linckelmann regarding Galois descent of splendid Rickard equivalences for blocks with compatible Galois stabilizers. A more general descent criteria for chain complexes is proven along the way, which requires the adaptation of a theorem of Reiner for chain complexes. This verifies Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for blocks of $p$-nilpotent groups with abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a well-known class of algebras called Igusa-Todorov algebras which were introduced in relation to finitistic dimension conjecture. As a generalization of Igusa-Todorov algebras, the new notion of $(m,n)$-Igusa-Todorov algebras provides a wider framework for studying derived dimensions. In this paper, we give methods for constructing $(m,n)$-Igusa-Todorov algebras. As an application, we present for general artin algebras a relationship between the derived dimension and the representation distance. Moreover, we end this paper to show that the main result can be used to give a better upper bound for the derived dimension for some classes of algebras.</description>
