      <description>arXiv:2406.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that some Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories, such as those with higher-dimensional operators with negative coefficients, lead to superluminality on some classical backgrounds. While superluminality by itself is not logically inconsistent, these theories also predict the formation of closed time-like curves at the classical level, starting from initial conditions without such curves. This leads to the formation of a Cauchy Horizon which prevents a complete description of the time evolution of such systems. Inspired by the chronology protection arguments of General Relativity, we show that quantum mechanical effects from low energy quanta strongly backreact on such configurations, exciting unknown short-distance degrees of freedom and invalidating the classical predictions. Thus, there is no obvious low-energy obstruction to the existence of these operators.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in Covariant Fracton Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariant (Lorentz invariant) fracton matter, minimally coupled and charged under a symmetric rank two gauge tensor, is considered. The gauge transformations correspond to linearised longitudinal diffeomorphisms. Consistent anomalies are computed using the BRST cohomological method. They depend only on the gauge field, treated as a background field, and on the gauge parameter, promoted to an anticommuting scalar ghost field. The problem is phrased in terms of polyforms, whose total degree is the sum of the form degree and of the ghost number. The most general anomaly in two dimensions and in four dimensions is computed and an anomaly in arbitrary dimension is individuated. In conclusion, it is shown that a simple higher-derivative scalar field theory is an example of covariant fracton matter. The model enjoys a global symmetry, which can be anomalous.</description>

      <title>Boundary operators in asymptotically flat space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2311.03443 the authors have proposed an interesting framework for studying holography in flat space-time. In this note we explore the relationship between their proposal and the Celestial Holography. In particular, we find that in both the massive and in the massless cases the asymptotic boundary limit of the bulk time-ordered Green's function $G$ is related to the Celestial amplitudes by an integral transformation. In the massless case the integral transformation reduces to the well known \textit{shadow transformation} of the celestial amplitude. Now the relation between the asymptotic limit of $G$ and the celestial amplitudes suggests that in asymptotically flat space-time if the scattering states are described by the conformal primary basis (and it's analytic continuation in dimension $\Delta$) then the boundary operators holographically dual to the (massless) bulk fields are given by the \underline{shadow transformation} of the conformal primary operators living on the celestial sphere. In other words, conformal primary operators themselves are not boundary operators but their shadows are. This is consistent with the fact that in celestial holography the boundary stress tensor is given by the shadow transformation of the subleading soft graviton.</description>

      <title>Exploring new constraints on Kahler moduli space of 6d N = 1 Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new constraints for 6d (1, 0) supergravity theories based on consistency conditions on the Kahler moduli spaces of their 5d reductions. The requirement that both the metric and the BPS string tensions in the Kahler moduli space are positive imposes specific restrictions on the Chern-Simons coefficients in the 5d effective Lagrangians that are derived from the Kaluza-Klein reductions of 6d theories. Moreover, the emergence of local interacting 5d CFTs when the moduli space metric degenerates introduces additional constraints coming from the analysis of 5d SCFTs. Focusing on the moduli spaces of 6d supergravity theories without a tensor multiplet and their Higgsings, we show that these constraints require the presence of certain primary states in the 2d worldvolume CFTs on 1/2 BPS strings. We specifically analyze a class of SU(2) models and infinite families of U(1) models using these constraints, and demonstrate that the theories featuring a 1-form symmetry in their massless spectra, unless the 1-form symmetry is gauged, fail to satisfy the constraints and therefore belong to the Swampland.</description>

      <title>Dispersive interaction between two atoms in Proca Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the influence of a massive photon in the dispersive interaction between two atoms in their fundamental states. We work in the context of Proca Quantum Electrodynamics. The photon mass not only introduces a new length scale but also gives rise to a longitudinal polarization for the electromagnetic field. We obtain explicitly the interaction energy between the atoms for any distance regime and consider several particular cases. We show that, for a given interatomic distance, the greater the photon mass the better it is the non-retarded approximation.</description>

      <title>Random Disks of Constant Curvature: the Lattice Story</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lay the groundwork for a UV-complete formulation of the Euclidean Jackiw-Teitelboim two-dimensional models of quantum gravity when the boundary lengths are finite, emphasizing the discretized approach. The picture that emerges is qualitatively new. For the disk topology, the problem reduces to counting so-called self-overlapping curves, that are closed loops that bound a distorted disk, with an appropriate multiplicity. We build a matrix model that does the correct counting. The theories in negative, zero and positive curvatures have the same UV description but drastically different macroscopic properties. The Schwarzian theory emerges in the limit of very large and negative cosmological constant in the negative curvature model, as an effective theory valid on distance scales much larger than the curvature length scale. In positive curvature, we argue that large geometries are ubiquitous and that the theory exists only for positive cosmological constant. Our discussion is pedagogical and includes a review of several relevant topics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to memory of late Professor V. G. Bagrov, who was my first teacher in theoretical physics. About 45 years later, theoretical physics has changed and me too. The subject of this paper relates some old ideas in cosmology with some recent ideas, as is reflected in the title. The current status of Starobinsky inflation is reviewed and compared to three main conjectures in the Swampland program. It is argued that the Starobinsky inflation model is not in conflict with those Swampland conjectures in their basic versions.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian spacetime and generalized thermofield double formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the non-Hermitian transition matrix and its gravity dual. States in quantum field theories or gravity theories are typically prepared using Euclidean path integrals. We demonstrate that it is both natural and necessary to introduce non-Hermitian transitions to describe the state when employing different inner products in Euclidean quantum field theories. Transition matrices that are $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian, with $\eta$ being positive-definite, play the same role as density matrices, where the operator $\eta$ is closely related to the definition of the inner product. Moreover, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between these transition matrices and density matrices. In the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Euclidean path integral in the boundary field theory can be translated to the bulk gravitational path integral. We provide an overview of the construction and interpretation of non-Hermitian spacetime. Specifically, we demonstrate the crucial role of the non-Hermitian transition matrix in realizing the thermofield concept in general cases and in understanding the gravity states dual to the eternal black hole. In this context, the pseudoentropy of the transition matrix can also be interpreted as black hole entropy. Finally, we highlight the strong subadditivity property of pseudoentropy, and the connection between non-Hermitian transition matrices and complex metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum kinetic equation for the gauge-invariant Wigner function, constructed from spinor fields that obey the Dirac equation modified by CPT and Lorentz symmetry-violating terms, is presented. The equations for the components of Wigner function in the Clifford algebra basis are accomplished. Focusing on the massless case, an extended semiclassical chiral kinetic theory in the presence of external electromagnetic fields is developed. We calculate the chiral currents and establish the anomalous magnetic and separation effects in a Lorentz-violating background. The chiral anomaly within the context of extended Quantum Electrodynamics is elucidated. Finally, we derive the semiclassical Lorentz-violating extended chiral transport equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corner symmetry algebra organises the physical charges induced by gravity on codimension-$2$ corners of a manifold. In this letter, we initiate a study of the quantum properties of this group. We first describe the central extensions and how the quantum corner symmetry group arises. We then classify the Casimirs and the induced unitary irreducible representation. We finally discuss the gluing of corners, achieved identifying the maximal commuting sub-algebra. This is a concrete implementation of the gravitational constraints at the quantum level, via the entangling product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any four-dimensional Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory with eight supercharges can be associated to a monoidal category of BPS line defects. Any Coulomb vacuum of such a theory can be conjecturally associated to an "algebra of BPS particles'', exemplified by certain Cohomological Hall Algebras. We conjecture the existence of a monoidal functor from the category of line defects to a certain category of bimodules for the BPS Algebra in any Coulomb vacuum. We describe images of simple objects under the conjectural functor and study their monoidal structure in examples. As we vary the choice of vacuum, we expect the collection of functors associated to any given theory to capture the full information of the original monoidal category of lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractons are exotic quasiparticles whose mobility in space is restricted by symmetries. In potential real-world realisations, fractons are likely lodged to a physical material rather than absolute space. Motivated by this, we propose and explore a new symmetry principle that restricts the motion of fractons relative to a physical solid. Unlike models with restricted mobility in absolute space, these fractonic solids admit gauge-invariant momentum density, are compatible with boost symmetry, and can consistently be coupled to gravity. We also propose a holographic model for fractonic solids.</description>

      <title>Holographic reconstruction of black hole spacetime: machine learning and entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the metallic property of these models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1991, Gelfand and Retakh embodied the idea of a noncommutative Dieudonne determinant in the case of RTT algebra, namely, they found a representation of the quantum determinant of RTT algebra in the form of a product of principal quasi-determinants. In this note we construct an analogue of the above statement for the RE-algebra corresponding to the Drinfeld R-matrix for the order $n=2,3$. Namely, we have found a family of quasi-determinants that are principal with respect to the antidiagonal, commuting among themselves, whose product turns out to be the quantum determinant of this algebra. This family generalizes the construction of integrals of the full Toda system due to Deift et al. for the quantum case of RE-algebras. In our opinion, this result also clarifies the role of RE-algebras as a quantum homogeneous spaces and can be used to construct effective quantum field theories with a boundary.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Multi-Stress Tensors in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of holographic conformal field theories (CFTs), a system of linear partial differential equations was recently proposed to be the higher-dimensional analogs of the null-state equations in $d=2$ CFTs at large central charge. Solving these equations in a near-lightcone expansion yields solutions that match the minimal-twist multi-stress tensor contributions to a heavy-light four-point correlator (or a thermal two-point correlator) computed using holography, the conformal bootstrap, and other methods. This note explores the exact solutions to these equations. We begin by observing that, in an expansion in terms of the ratio between the heavy operator's dimension and the central charge, the $d=2$ correlator involving the level-two degenerate scalars at each order can be represented as a Bessel function; the resummation yields the Virasoro vacuum block. We next observe a relation between the $d=2$ correlator and the $d=4$ near-lightcone correlator involving light scalars with the same conformal dimension. The resummed $d=4$ correlator takes a simple form in the complex frequency domain. Unlike the Virasoro vacuum block, the resummation in $d=4$ leads to essential singularities. Similar expressions are also obtained when the light scalar's dimension takes other finite values. These CFT results correspond to a holographic computation with a spherical black hole. In addition, using the differential equations, we demonstrate that the correlators can be reconstructed via certain modes. In $d=2$, these modes are related to the Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <title>The Renormalization Group for Large-Scale Structure: Primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group for large-scale structure (RG-LSS) describes the evolution of galaxy bias and stochastic parameters as a function of the cutoff $\Lambda$. In this work, we introduce interaction vertices that describe primordial non-Gaussianity into the Wilson-Polchinski framework, thereby extending the free theory to the interacting case. The presence of these interactions forces us to include new operators and bias coefficients to the bias expansion to ensure closure under renormalization. We recover the previously-derived ``scale-dependent bias'' contributions, as well as a new (subdominant) stochastic contribution. We derive the renormalization group equations governing the RG-LSS for a large class of interactions which account for vertices at linear order in $f_{\rm NL}$ that parametrize interacting scalar and massive spinning fields during inflation. Solving the RG equations, we show the evolution of the non-Gaussian contributions to galaxy clustering as a function of scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Inflaton Production of Scalar Dark Matter through Fluctuations and Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects on particle production of a Planck-suppressed coupling between the inflaton and a scalar dark matter candidate, $\chi$. In the absence of this coupling, the dominant source for the relic density of $\chi$ is the long wavelength modes produced from the scalar field fluctuations during inflation. In this case, there are strong constraints on the mass of the scalar and the reheating temperature after inflation from the present-day relic density of $\chi$ (assuming $\chi$ is stable). When a coupling $\sigma \phi^2 \chi^2$ is introduced, with $\sigma = {\tilde \sigma} m_\phi^2/ M_P^2 \sim 10^{-10} {\tilde \sigma}$, where $m_\phi$ is the inflaton mass, the allowed parameter space begins to open up considerably even for ${\tilde \sigma}$ as small as $\gtrsim 10^{-7}$. For ${\tilde \sigma} \gtrsim \frac{9}{16}$, particle production is dominated by the scattering of the inflaton condensate, either through single graviton exchange or the contact interaction between $\phi$ and $\chi$. In this regime, the range of allowed masses and reheating temperatures is maximal. For $0.004 &lt; {\tilde \sigma} &lt; 50$, constraints from isocurvature fluctuations are satisfied, and the production from parametric resonance can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets, a New Anomaly, Instantons, and (noninvertible) Continuous Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a d-2-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as U(1) gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization and Wichmann-Kroll correction in the finite basis set approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The finite basis set method is commonly used to calculate atomic spectra, including QED contributions such as bound-electron self-energy. Still, it remains problematic and underexplored for vacuum-polarization calculations. We fill this gap by trying this approach in its application to the calculation of the vacuum-polarization charge density and the Wichmann-Kroll correction to the electron binding energy in a hydrogen-like ion. We study the convergence of the method with different types and sizes of basis sets. We cross-check our results for the Wichmann-Kroll correction by direct integration of the Green's function. As a relevant example, we consider several heavy hydrogen-like ions and evaluate the vacuum polarization correction for $S$ and $P$ electron orbitals.</description>

      <title>Displacement versus velocity memory effects from a gravitational plane wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article demonstrates that additionally to the well-known velocity memory effect, a vacuum gravitational plane wave can also induce a displacement memory on a couple of test particles. A complete classification of the conditions under which a velocity or a displacement memory effect occur is established. These conditions depend both the initial conditions of the relative motion and on the wave profile. The two cases where the wave admits a pulse or a step profile are treated. Our analytical expressions are then compared to numerical integrations to exhibit either a velocity or a displacement memory, in the case of these two families of profiles. Additionally to this classification, the existence of a new symmetry of polarized vacuum gravitational plane wave under M\"{o}bius reparametrization of the null time is demonstrated. Finally, we discuss the resolution of the geodesic deviation equation by means of the underlying symmetries of vacuum gravitational plane wave.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of an extremal horizon in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory must admit a Killing vector field or is static. This implies that any such horizon must be an extremal Kerr-Newman horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Contributions of QED diagrams with vacuum polarization insertions to the lepton anomaly within the Mellin--Barnes representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the radiative QED corrections to the lepton ($L=e,~\mu$ and $\tau$) anomalous magnetic moment arising from vacuum polarization diagrams by four closed lepton loops. The method is based on the consecutive application of dispersion relations for the polarization operator and the Mellin--Barnes transform for the propagators of massive particles. This allows one to obtain, for the first time, exact analytical expressions for the radiative corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons from diagrams with insertions of four identical lepton loops all of the same type $\ell$ different from the external one, $L$. The result is expressed in terms of the mass ratio $r=m_\ell/m_L$. We investigate the behaviour of the exact analytical expressions at $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ and compare with the corresponding asymptotic expansions known in the literature.</description>

      <title>The magic of entangled top quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an increasing body of work examining how quantum entanglement can be measured at high energy particle physics experiments, thereby complementing traditional table-top experiments. This begs the question of whether more concepts from quantum computation can be examined at colliders, and we here consider the property of magic, which distinguishes those quantum states which have a genuine computational advantage over classical states. We examine top anti-top pair production at the LHC, showing that nature chooses to produce magic tops, where the amount of magic varies with the kinematics of the final state. We compare results for individual partonic channels and at proton-level, showing that averaging over final states typically increases magic. This is in contrast to entanglement measures, such as the concurrence, which typically decrease. Our results create new links between the quantum information and particle physics literatures, providing practical insights for further study.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario in a type II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type-II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and Cosmic Shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quiver Yangians were originally defined for the quiver and superpotential from string theory on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and serve as BPS algebras of these systems. Their characters reproduce the unrefined BPS indices, which correspond to classical Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants. We generalize this construction in two directions. First, we show that this definition extends to arbitrary quivers with potentials. Second, we explain how to define the characters to incorporate the refined BPS indices, which correspond to motivic DT invariants. We focus on two main classes of quivers: the BPS quivers of 4D $N=2$ theories and the quivers from the knot-quiver correspondence. The entire construction allows for straightforward generalizations to trigonometric, elliptic, and generalized cohomologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $O(3)$ critical model and the free theory of a scalar triplet in the presence of a magnetic impurity. We use analytic bootstrap techniques to extract results in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. First, we extend by one order in perturbation theory the computation of the beta function for the defect coupling in the free theory. Then, we analyze in detail the low-lying spectrum of defect operators, focusing on their perturbative realization when the defect is constructed as a path-ordered exponential. After this, we consider two different bulk two-point functions and we compute them using the defect dispersion relation. For a free bulk theory, we are able to fix the form of the correlator at all orders in $\varepsilon$. In particular, taking $\varepsilon\to1$, we can show that in $d=3$ one does not have a consistent and non-trivial defect CFT. For an interacting bulk, we compute the correlator up to second order in $\varepsilon$. Expanding these results in the bulk and defect block expansions, we are able to extract an infinite set of defect CFT data. We discuss low-spin ambiguities that affect every result computed through the dispersion relation and we use a combination of consistency conditions and explicit diagrammatic calculations to fix this ambiguity.</description>

      <title>The Higgs Branch of Heterotic LSTs: Hasse Diagrams and Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Higgs branches of the 6d $(1,0)$ little string theories that live on the worldvolume of NS5-branes probing an ADE-singularity in the heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ and $\mathrm{Spin}(32)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ string theories. On the $E_8 \times E_8$ side, such LSTs are obtained via fusion of orbi-instanton SCFTs. For the $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_K$ orbifolds, we determine a magnetic quiver for the Higgs branch from the alternative Type IIA brane system engineering the LST; we show that the magnetic quiver obtained in this way is the same as the Coulomb gauging of the 3d mirrors associated to the orbi-instanton building blocks. Using quiver subtraction, we determine the Hasse diagram of Higgs branch RG flows between the LSTs, and we analyze how the structure constants of the generalized global symmetries vary along the edges of the Hasse diagram. From the Hasse diagram of the Higgs branch, we are immediately able to identify LSTs with the same T-duality-invariant properties, and thus to propose candidate T-dual pairs. We perform a similar analysis of the Higgs branch Hasse diagram and putative T-dual families for particular $E_6$-orbifold LSTs by taking advantage of a duality between a rank zero orbi-instanton theory and a rank one conformal matter theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental Kazakov-Migdal (FKM) model on a generic graph, whose partition function is represented by the Ihara zeta function weighted by unitary matrices. The FKM model becomes unstable in the critical strip of the Ihara zeta function. We discover a duality between small and large couplings, associated with the functional equation of the Ihara zeta function for regular graphs. Although the duality is not precise for irregular graphs, we show that the effective action in the large coupling region can be represented by a summation of all possible Wilson loops on the graph similar to that in the small coupling region. We estimate the phase structure of the FKM model both in the small and large coupling regions by comparing it with the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) model. We further validate the theoretical analysis through detailed numerical simulations.</description>

It has two ingredients: a change of field variables and a change of space time coordinates. The change of field variables ensures that the loop expansion parameter becomes ${1\over N}$. The change of coordinates solves the Clebsch-Gordan problem of moving from the tensor product basis (in which the collective bilocal field is written) to the direct sum basis (appropriate for the description of the gravity fields). We argue that the change of space time coordinates can be deduced by requiring that operators constructed in the bilocal collective field theory are dual to local operators in the AdS bulk.</description>

      <title>The strong CP problem revisited and solved by the gauge group topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the non-perturbative result that the $\theta$ angle which defines the vacuum structure is not a $c$-number free parameter, as suggested by the instanton semi-classical approximation, but instead one of the points of the spectrum of the central operator $\tilde{\theta}$ which describes the gauge group topology. Hence, the value of such an angle should not be \textit{a priori} fixed, but rather be determined, as any quantum operator, by the infinite volume limit of the functional integral, where the fermionic mass term uniquely fixes the phase, with $&lt; \tilde{\theta} &gt; = \theta_M$, the mass angle. Such an equality is stable under radiative corrections performed before the infinite volume limit of the functional integral.
  The mechanisms is carefully controlled in the massive Schwinger model with attention to the infrared problems, to the volume effects induced by boundary terms and with a careful discussion of the infinite volume limit of the functional integral. The extension to the QCD case relies on the choice of modified APS boundary conditions which do not break chiral symmetry, allowing for the crucial role of the fermionic mass term in uniquely determining the phase, with a solution of the strong $CP$ problem.</description>

Abstract: We present the proof of renormalization of the Horava theory, in the nonprojectable version. We obtain a form of the quantum action that exhibits a manifest BRST-symmetry structure. Previous analysis have shown that the divergences produced by irregular loops cancel completely between them. The remaining divergences are local. The renormalization is achieved by using the approach developed by Barvinsky et al. with the background-field formalism.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentropy sum rule by analytical continuation of the superposition parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sum rule that connects the pseudoentropy and entanglement entropy of a superposition state. Through analytical continuation of the superposition parameter, we demonstrate that the transition matrix and density matrix of the superposition state can be treated in a unified manner. Within this framework, we naturally derive sum rules for the (reduced) transition matrix, pseudo R\'enyi entropy, and pseudoentropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the close relationship between the sum rule for pseudoentropy and the singularity structure of the entropy function for the superposition state after analytical continuation. We also explore potential applications of the sum rule, including its relevance to understanding the gravity dual of non-Hermitian transition matrices and establishing upper bounds for the absolute value of pseudoentropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the notion of a marked moduli space as the parameter space of a physical theory together with all of its observables. In geometric examples, this coincides with the mathematical notion of Teichm\"uller space. We propose two new Swampland principles about the geometry of marked moduli spaces: We conjecture that a marked moduli space is always contractible, and moreover, that there is a unique geodesic connecting any pair of points in it with respect to its physical metric. We provide strong evidence for these conjectures for theories with 8 or more supercharges.</description>

Abstract: We give a tentative definition of the recently introduced Root-$T\bar{T}$ operator in a generic, two dimensional quantum conformal field theory with continuous spectrum of scaling weights. The definition assumes certain factorization properties and uses Schwinger parametrization to introduce the square root. Properties of the operator thus defined are investigated by explicit computation of variations of two- and three-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>One-form symmetries and the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $A$-model: Topologically twisted indices for any $G$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories with a one-form symmetry in the $A$-model formalism on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$. We explicitly compute expectation values of topological line operators that implement the one-form symmetry. This allows us to compute the topologically twisted index on the closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ for any real compact gauge group $G$. All computations are carried out in the effective $A$-model on $\Sigma_g$, whose ground states are the so-called Bethe vacua. We discuss how the 3d one-form symmetry acts on the Bethe vacua, and how its 't Hooft anomaly constrains the vacuum structure. In the special case of the $SU(N)_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory, we obtain results for the $(SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_r)^{\theta}_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories, for all non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_r \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N$ subgroups of the center of the gauge group, and with the associated $\mathbb{Z}_r$ $\theta$-angle turned on, reproducing and extending various results in the literature. In particular, we find an interesting mixed 't Hooft anomaly between gravity and the $\mathbb{Z}_r$ one-form symmetry of the $SU(N)_K$ theory (for $N$ even, $\frac{N}{r}$ odd and $\frac{K}{r}$ even). This plays a key role in our derivation of the Witten index, which we explicitly compute for any $N$, $K$ and $r$ in terms of refinements of Jordan's totient function. Our results lead to precise conjectures about integrality of indices, which appear to have a strong number-theoretic flavour. Note: this paper directly builds upon unpublished notes by Brian Willett from 2020.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent proposals for the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of Maxwell theory admit a 0-form symmetry compatible with the classical $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ duality of electromagnetism. We describe how to realize these automorphisms of the SymTFT in terms of its operators and we detail their effects on the dynamical theory and its global variants. In the process, we show that the classical $U(1)$ symmetry, corresponding to the stabilizer of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, can be restored as a non-invertible one, by means of an infinite series of discrete gauging. This provides an example of the reemergence of a classical symmetry in the quantum regime, which was not broken by anomalies, but rather by the quantization of electromagnetic fluxes. However, this procedure comes at the price of introducing "continuous" condensates that trivialize all line operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regge poles connect the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes, analytically continued in spin, to the high-energy limit in momentum space. Dual models are expected to have only Regge poles, and string theory suggests there should be an infinite number of them. In this study, we investigate the number of Regge trajectories these models may have. We prove, based solely on crossing symmetry and unitarity, that meromorphic amplitudes, with or without subtractions, cannot produce a reggeizing amplitude if they contain any finite number of Regge trajectories. We argue that this should exclude the existence of such amplitudes altogether. Additionally, we develop and apply a linear programming dual bootstrap method to exclude these amplitudes directly in momentum space.</description>

Abstract: Infra-Red scaling property of inflationary universe is in the same universality class of random walk. The two point correlators of the curvature perturbations are enhanced by the e-folding number N. The distribution function of the curvature perturbation $\rho_t (\zeta)$ satisfies the Fokker Planck equation. The de Sitter universes are dual to the random walk: They belong to the Universality class of dimension two fractal. These boundary and bulk duality are at the heart of holography of quantum gravity. Historically the correspondence of thermodynamics and Einstein's equation are recognized as the first evidence for de Sitter duality .Our de Sitter duality relates the stochastic and geometric point of view. We study two types of the solutions of FP equation in quasi de Sitter space: (1) UV complete spacetime and (2) inflationary spacetime with concave potentials. The maximum entropy principle favors the following scenario: The universe is (a) born with small epsilon and (b) grows by inflation in the concave potential. We predict n_s &lt;0.975(0.97) and r &lt; 0.04(0.03) for N=50(60) at the pivot angle 0.002Mpc^{-1}. We have lowered the upper bound of $r$ by taking account of random walk effect at the boundary. Our predictions are highly consistent with recent observations.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several approaches to formulate gauge-invariant models for massive integer-spin field in $d$ dimensions including the following: (i) in terms of symmetric tensor fields $\phi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, with $k = s, s-1, \dots , 0$, restricted to be double traceless for $k\geq 4$; and (ii) in terms of a quartet of $traceful$ symmetric tensor fields $\psi_{\mu_1 \dots \mu_k} $, of rank $k=s,s-1,s-2, s-3$. We demonstrate that these formulations in Minkowski space ${\mathbb M}^d$ are equivalent to the gauge-invariant theory for a massive integer-spin field proposed in 1989 by Pashnev. We also make use of the Klishevich-Zinoviev theory in ${\mathbb M}^d$ to derive a generalisation of the Singh-Hagen model for a massive integer-spin field in $d&gt;4 $ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop theoretical methods for the implementation of creation and destruction operators in separate registers of a quantum computer, allowing for a transparent and dynamical creation and destruction of particle modes in second quantization in problems with variable particle number. We establish theorems for the commutation (anticommutation) relations on a finite memory bank and provide the needed symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing operators. Finally, we provide formulae in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify $n$ particles with $N_p$ modes each is of order $n\log_2 N_p$. Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires $O(N_p)$ qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each). And although less efficient, it is also less cumbersome than compact encoding.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and thermodynamic crossovers in the supercritical region of a holographic superfluid model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical systems, including classical fluids, present in their phase diagram the competition between two phases that are separated by a line of first-order phase transitions which terminates at a so-called critical point. Despite several proposals, in the supercritical region beyond the critical point, whether the two phases can still be distinguished and by which criterion remain open questions. In this work, we study the thermodynamics and linear dynamics of a holographic superfluid model with nonlinear potential terms in the supercritical region. We identify the presence of a dynamical crossover, akin to the liquid-like to gas-like Frenkel transition in supercritical fluids, and we define other separation lines of thermodynamic origin based on higher order derivatives of the free energy with respect to the charge density. Our results highlight the universal dynamical and thermodynamic features of supercritical systems from nuclear matter and classical fluids to superfluid systems.</description>

Abstract: We develop new perturbative tools to accurately study radiatively-induced first-order phase transitions. Previous perturbative methods have suffered internal inconsistencies and been unsuccessful in reproducing lattice data, which is often attributed to infrared divergences of massless modes (the Linde problem). We employ a consistent power counting scheme to perform calculations, and compare our results against lattice data. We conclude that the consistent expansion removes many previous issues, and indicates that the infamous Linde problem is not as big a factor in these calculations as previously thought.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a toy model mechanism of geometric cancellation, alleviating the (classical) cosmological constant problem. To do so, we assume at primordial times that vacuum energy fuels an inflationary quadratic hilltop potential nonminimally coupled to gravity through a standard Yukawa-like interacting term, whose background lies on a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. We demonstrate how vacuum energy release transforms into geometric particles, adopting a quasi-de Sitter phase where we compute the expected particle density and mass ranges. Perturbations are introduced by means of the usual external-field appproximation, so that the back-reaction of the created particles on the geometry is not considered here. We discuss the limitations of this approach and we also suggest possible refinements. We then propose the most suitable dark matter candidates, showing under which circumstances we can interpret dark matter as constituted by geometric quasiparticles. We confront our predictions with quantum particle production and constraints made using a Higgs portal. In addition, the role of the bare cosmological constant is reinterpreted to speed up the universe today. Thus, consequences on the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm are critically highlighted, showing how both coincidence and fine-tuning issues can be healed requiring the Israel-Darmois matching conditions between our involved inhomogeneous and homogeneous phases.</description>

      <title>Cubic* criticality emerging from a quantum loop model on triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal examples of correlated systems with local constraints. Obtaining generic solutions for these models is difficult due to the lack of controlled methods to solve them in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, these solutions are of immediate relevance to both statistical and quantum field theories, as well as the rapidly growing experiments in Rydberg atom arrays and quantum moir\'e materials, where the interplay between correlation and local constraints gives rise to a plethora of novel phenomena. In a recent work [X. Ran, Z. Yan, Y.-C. Wang, et al, arXiv:2205.04472 (2022)], it was found through sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) hosts a rich ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic, vison plaquette (VP) crystals, and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating the VP and QSL phases and demonstrate via both static and dynamic probes in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)D cubic* universality. In this transition, the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline VP phase, while leaving their trace in the anomalously large anomalous dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra compared with those at the conventional cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent limitations. In this work, we introduce the \textit{hyperfine structure of entanglement}, which dissects entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holographic duality, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality and extending bulk reconstruction; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in exactly solvable lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E&lt;v_B$. For the lowest level of the hierarchy, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits, the entanglement line tension can be computed entirely, while for the higher levels the solvability is reduced to certain regions in spacetime. This partial solvability enables us to place bounds on the entanglement velocity. We find that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also develop new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates, including constructions based on complex Hadamard matrices that exhibit additional solvability properties and constructions that display behavior unique to local dimension greater than or equal to three. Our results shed light on entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by comparison to exact and numerical calculations. Moreover, they demonstrate that generalized dual-unitary circuits display a more generic form of information dynamics than dual-unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>Absorption, scattering, quasinormal modes and shadow by canonical acoustic black holes in Lorentz-violating background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we study the scattering for a black hole described by the canonical acoustic metric with Lorentz violation using asymptotic and numerical methods. In this scenario, we also check the effects of quasinormal modes and the acoustic shadow radius. In the eikonal limit the relationship between the shadow radius and the real part of the quasinormal frequency is preserved.</description>

      <title>Representational conventions and invariant structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the philosophical literature, symmetries of physical theories are most often interpreted within the general doctrine called 'Sophistication'. Roughly speaking, it says that models related by symmetries can peacefully co-exist while representing the same physical possibility. But this interpretation still leaves open two main worries about Sophistication: (a) it allows the individuation of what I call 'structure-tokens' to remain intractable and thus of limited use, which is why practising physicists frequently invoke 'relational, symmetry-invariant observables'; and (b) it leaves us with no formal framework for expressing counterfactual statements about the world. Here, I will show that a new Desideratum to be satisfied by theories with symmetries answers these worries. The new Desideratum is that the theory admits what I will call representational conventions for its structure-tokens.</description>

      <title>Signal of phase transition hidden in quasinormal modes of regular AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the intrinsic relations between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasinormal modes in regular AdS black holes, specifically in the Bardeen and Hayward AdS classes. To this end, we calculate the quasinormal modes of massless scalar field perturbations around small and large black holes via the Horowitz-Hubeny method. By investigating the isobaric and isothermal phase transitions for Bardeen and Hayward AdS black holes in detail, we observe that a dramatic change of quasinormal modes appears near the phase transition point of small and large black holes, and that it corresponds to the swallow tail structure in the plane of Gibbs free energy with respect to pressure. Moreover, by analyzing the evolution of black holes along the coexistence curve of small and large black hole phases, we also observe the dramatic change in quasinormal modes. Such a phenomenon confirms the signal of the phase transition in the quasinormal mode spectrum, which can be understood as a thermodynamic signal hidden in the dynamical spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Macrorealism formalizes the intuitive notion that at any given time the system occupies a definite state and that the evolution of the system is independent of the measurements performed on it, in contrast to the principles of quantum mechanics. In this study, we carry out a comparative analysis between three-time Leggett--Garg-type inequalities and the conditions of no-signaling-in-time and arrow-of-time for macrorealism within the context of meson oscillations. Our findings indicate that, under given initial conditions, no violations of Leggett--Garg inequalities are observed. However, no-signaling-in-time conditions are found to be violated, thereby revealing the impossibility of applying a macrorealistic description to the analysis of meson physics.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Conserved currents in five-dimensional proposals for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the Grabowska-Kaplan framework, originally proposed for lattice chiral gauge theories, to QCD. We show that the resulting theory contains a conserved and gauge invariant singlet axial current, both on the lattice and in the continuum limit. This must give rise to a difference with QCD, with the simplest possibility being a superfluous Nambu-Goldstone boson in the physical spectrum not present in QCD. We find a similar unwanted conserved current in the recent "disk" formalism [Kaplan, Kaplan &amp; Sen], this time limiting ourselves to the continuum formulation. A similar problem is expected when either of these formalisms is used for its original goal of constructing lattice chiral gauge theories. Finally we discuss a conjecture about the possible dynamics that might be associated with the unwanted conserved current, and the fate of 't Hooft vertices.</description>

      <title>Investigations on Lorentzian Spin-foams and Semiclassical Space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis is developed in the context of the spin-foam approach to quantum gravity; all results are concerned with the Lorentzian theory and with semiclassical methods. A correspondence is given between Majorana 2-spinors and time-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski 3-space based on complexified quaternions. It is shown that the former suggest a symplectic structure on the spinor phase space which, together with an area-matching constraint, yields a symplectomorphism to $T^*\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$. A complete 3-dimensional Lorentzian spin-foam amplitude for both space- and time-like triangles is proposed. It is shown to asymptote to Regge theory in the semiclassical regime. The asymptotic limit of the 4-dimensional Conrady-Hnybida model for general polytopes is scrutinized. Minkowski's theorem on convex polyhedra is generalized to Lorentzian signature, and new boundary states for time-like polygons are introduced. It is found that the semiclassical amplitude for such polygons is insufficiently constrained. A method for the asymptotic evaluation of integrals subject to external parameters is discussed. The method is developed in detail for the special problem of spin-foam gluing constraints away from their dominant critical points. A relation to the gluing constraints of effective spin-foams is suggested.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity/entropic gravity correspondence due to graviton mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some time ago, it has been suggested that gravitons can acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of diffeomorphisms through the condensation of scalar fields [Chamseddine and Mukhanov, JHEP, 2010]. Taking this possibility into account, in the present paper, first we show how the graviton mass intricately reshapes the gravitational potential akin to a Yukawa-like potential at large distances. Notably, this long-range force modifies the Newton's law in large distances and might explain the phenomena of dark matter. The most important finding in the present paper is the derivation of a modified Newtons law of gravity by modifying the Verlindes entropic force relation due to the graviton contribution. The graviton contribution to the entropy basically measures the correlation of graviton and matter fields which then reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon. This result shows the dual description of gravity: in the language of quantum information and entropy the gravity can be viewed as an entropic force, however in terms of particles and fields, it can be viewed as a longe range force. Further we have recovered the corrected Einstein field equations as well as the $\Lambda$CDM where dark matter emerges as an apparent effect.</description>

      <title>On the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for spin chains with simple $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for a closed, rational spin chain with $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry for any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Starting the nesting process by removing a single simple root from $\mathfrak{g}$, we use the residual $U(1)$ charge and the block Gauss decomposition of the $R$-matrix to derive many standard results in the Bethe ansatz, such as the nesting of Yangian algebras, and the AB commutation relation.</description>

      <title>Minimal W-algebras with non-admissible levels and intermediate Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Kawasetsu:2018irs}, Kawasetsu proved that the simple W-algebra associated with a minimal nilpotent element $W_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ is rational and $C_2$-cofinite for $\mathfrak{g}=D_4,E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6$. In this paper, we study ${W}_{k}(\mathfrak{g},f_\theta)$ algebra for $\mathfrak{g}=E_6,E_7,E_8$ with non-admissible level $k=-h^\vee/6+1$. We determine all irreducible (Ramond twisted) modules, compute their characters and find coset constructions and Hecke operator interpretations. These W-algebras are closely related to intermediate Lie algebras and intermediate vertex subalgebras.</description>
