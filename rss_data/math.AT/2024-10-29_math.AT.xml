      <title>Equivariant Framed Little Disk Operads are Additive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Dunn-Brinkmeier~additivity theorem, which establishes a weak equivalence $\mathcal{C}_n \otimes \mathcal{C}_m \simeq \mathcal{C}_{n+m}$ for the little cubes operad $\mathcal{C}_n$. We introduce equivariant framed little disk operads, a new class of operads that simultaneously generalize the framed little disk operads and the little $V$-disk operads associated with a $G$-representation $V$. We prove that these operads satisfy an analogous additivity property, extending the classical theorem to settings involving group actions and framings.</description>

      <title>The unstable homotopy groups of 2-cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the new method, initiated by B. Gray (1972), to compute the unstable homotopy groups of the mapping cone, especially for $2$-cell complex $X=S^m\cup_{\alpha} e^{n}$. By Gray's work mentioned above or the traditional method given by I.M.James (1957) which were widely used in previous related work to compute $\pi_{i}(X)$, the dimension $i\leq 2n+m-4$. By our method, we can compute $\pi_{i}(X)$ for $i&gt;2n+m-4$. We use this different technique to generalize J.Wu's work, at Mem. of AMS, on homotopy groups of mod $2$ Moore spaces to higher dimensional homotopy groups of mod $2^r$ Moore spaces $P^{n}(2^r)$ for all $r\geq 1$. This practice shows that the technique given here is a new general method to compute the unstable homotopy groups of CW complexes with higher dimension.</description>

      <title>On the chain rule in Goodwillie calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the Arone-Ching chain rule for Goodwillie derivatives by showing that for any pair of reduced finitary functors $F \colon \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{E}$ and $G \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between differentiable $\infty$-categories, there is an equivalence $\partial_*(FG) \simeq \partial_*F \circ_{\partial_*{\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{D}}}} \partial_*G$. This confirms a conjecture of Lurie. The proof of this theorem consists of two parts, which are of independent interest. We first show that the Goodwillie derivatives can be refined to a lax functor $\partial_* \colon \mathrm{Diff} \to \mathrm{Pr}^{\mathrm{Sym}}_{\mathrm{St}}$ from the $(\infty, 2)$-category of differentiable $\infty$-categories and reduced finitary functors to a certain $(\infty, 2)$-category of generalized symmetric sequences. Such a lax structure on the Goodwillie derivatives was long believed to exist, but has not been constructed prior to this work. We then finish the proof by studying the interaction of this lax functor with Koszul duality. In order to do so, we establish a new universal property of the bar-cobar adjunction.</description>

      <title>Homotopy reflectivity is equivalent to the weak Vop\v{e}nka principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homotopical localizations with respect to (possibly proper) classes of maps are known to exist assuming the validity of a large-cardinal axiom from set theory called Vop\v{e}nka's principle. In this article, we prove that each of the following statements is equivalent to an axiom of lower consistency strength than Vop\v{e}nka's principle, known as weak Vop\v{e}nka's principle: (a) Localization with respect to any class of maps exists in the homotopy category of simplicial sets; (b) Localization with respect to any class of maps exists in the homotopy category of spectra; (c) Localization with respect to any class of morphisms exists in any presentable $\infty$-category; (d) Every full subcategory closed under products and fibres in a triangulated category with locally presentable models is reflective. Our results are established using Wilson's 2020 solution to a long-standing open problem concerning the relative consistency of weak Vop\v{e}nka's principle within the large-cardinal hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Towards Cohomology of Real Closed Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was shown by Claus Scheiderer prior to 1994 that real closed spaces have \'{e}tale cohomology. Following Scheiderer, study of real closed spaces fell out of fashion and o-minimal geometry became the focus for those at the intersection of model theory and geometry. I decided to breathe new life into the theory of real closed rings and spaces, as studied by Schwartz in 1989. In Section 1, I build the fundamentals of the theory using as little machinery as possible, and presented them as clearly as I could. Hidden gems include a full proof that real closed rings are closed under limits and colimits. In Section 2, I give an introduction to the category of real closed spaces in the first half. In the second half, I construct an equivalence of topoi between Scheiderer's sheaves on the real \'{e}tale site, and sheaves on a real \'{e}tale site $\rce/X$ of my creation. Since $\text{Sh}(\rce/X)$ can be defined without the use of $G$-topoi, the equivalence of topoi renders Scheiderer's theory computable. I end with a discussion of how one might use motivic cohomology to better understand recent results of Annette Huber in \cite{no_deRham_huber}.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm for Computing Zigzag Representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zigzag filtrations of simplicial complexes generalize the usual filtrations by allowing simplex deletions in addition to simplex insertions. The barcodes computed from zigzag filtrations encode the evolution of homological features. Although one can locate a particular feature at any index in the filtration using existing algorithms, the resulting representatives may not be compatible with the zigzag: a representative cycle at one index may not map into a representative cycle at its neighbor. For this, one needs to compute compatible representative cycles along each bar in the barcode. Even though it is known that the barcode for a zigzag filtration with $m$ insertions and deletions can be computed in $O(m^\omega)$ time, it is not known how to compute the compatible representatives so efficiently. For a non-zigzag filtration, the classical matrix-based algorithm provides representatives in $O(m^3)$ time, which can be improved to $O(m^\omega)$. However, no known algorithm for zigzag filtrations computes the representatives with the $O(m^3)$ time bound. We present an $O(m^2n)$ time algorithm for this problem, where $n\leq m$ is the size of the largest complex in the filtration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every open-closed homotopy algebra, introduced by Kajiura and Stasheff (arXiv: archive/0410291), naturally gives rise to an open-closed version of Hochschild cochain complex whose cohomology admits a canonical Gerstenhaber algebra structure. We also develop the open-closed brace relations, provide a concise description of OCHAs, and establish an A-infinity structure that extends the open-closed Hochschild differential.</description>

      <title>Localisations and completions of nilpotent $G$-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of nilpotent $G$-spaces and their localisations, for $G$ a compact Lie group, via reduction to the non-equivariant case using Bousfield localisation. One point of interest in the equivariant setting is that we can choose to localise or complete at different sets of primes at different fixed point spaces - and the theory works out just as well provided that you invert more primes at $K \leq G$ than at $H \leq G$, whenever $K$ is subconjugate to $H$ in $G$. We also develop the theory in an unbased context, allowing us to extend the theory to $G$-spaces which are not $G$-connected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an equivariant analog of Weiss calculus of functors for all finite group $\mathrm{G}$. In our theory, Taylor approximations and derivatives are index by finite dimensional $\mathrm{G}$-representations, and homogeneous layers are classified by orthogonal $\mathrm{G}$-spectra. Further, our framework permits a notion of restriction as well as a notion of fixed-point at the level of Weiss functors. We establish various results comparing Taylor approximations and derivatives of fixed-point (resp. restrictions) functors to that of the fixed-point (resp. restrictions) of Taylor approximations and derivatives.</description>

      <title>Norms and Transfers in Motivic Homotopy Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the compatibility between norms and transfers in motivic homotopy theory. More precisely, we construct norm functors for motivic spaces equipped with various flavours of transfer. This yields a norm monoidal refinement of the infinite $\mathbb{P}^1$-delooping machine of Elmanto-Hoyois-Khan-Sosnilo-Yakerson. We apply this refinement to construct a normed algebra structure on the very effective Hermitian $\mathrm{K}$-theory spectrum.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux- and charge-quantization laws for higher gauge fields of Maxwell type -- e.g. the common electromagnetic field (the "A-field") but also the B-, RR-, and C-fields considered in string/M-theory -- specify non-perturbative completions of these fields by encoding their solitonic behaviour and hence by specifying the discrete charges carried by the individual branes (higher-dimensional monopoles or solitons) that source the field fluxes.
  This article surveys the general (rational-)homotopy theoretic understanding of flux- and charge-quantization via the Chern-Dold character map generalized to the non-linear (self-sourcing) Bianchi identities that appear in higher-dimensional supergravity theories, notably for B&amp;RR-fields in D=10, for the C-field in D=11 supergravity, and for the B-field on fivebrane worldvolumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new homotopy invariant of metric spaces, called the distributional LS-category, was defined, which provides a lower bound to the classical LS-category. In this paper, we obtain several sufficient conditions for the distributional LS-category (dcat) of a closed manifold to be maximum, i.e., equal to its classical LS-category (cat). These give us many new computations of dcat, especially for some essential manifolds and (generalized) connected sums. In the process, we also determine the cat of closed 3-manifolds having torsion-free fundamental groups and some closed geometrically decomposable 4-manifolds. Finally, we extend some of our results to closed Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below and discuss their cat and dcat in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Fan distributions via Tverberg partitions and Gale duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equipartition theory, beginning with the classical ham sandwich theorem, seeks the fair division of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by the full-dimensional regions determined by a prescribed geometric dissection of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Here we examine $\textit{equidistributions}$ of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by prescribed $\textit{low dimensional}$ subsets. Our main result states that if $r\geq 3$ is a prime power, then for any $m$-coloring of a sufficiently small point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an $r$-fan in $\mathbb{R}^d$ -- that is, the union of $r$ ``half-flats'' of codimension $r-2$ centered about a common $(r-1)$-codimensional affine subspace -- which captures all the points of $X$ in such a way that each half-flat contains at most an $r$-th of the points from each color class. The number of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we require for this is essentially tight when $m\geq 2$. Additionally, we extend our equidistribution results to ''piercing'' distributions in a similar fashion to Dolnikov's hyperplane transversal generalization of the ham sandwich theorem. By analogy with recent work of Frick et al., our results are obtained by applying Gale duality to linear cases of topological Tverberg-type theorems. Finally, we extend our distribution results to multiple $r$-fans after establishing a multiple intersection version of a topological Tverberg-type theorem due to Sarkaria.</description>
