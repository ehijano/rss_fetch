      <title>Coarse Set Theory: A Mathematical Foundation for Coarse Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ethical decision-making, individuals are often evaluated based on generalized assessments rather than precise individual performance. This concept, known as Coarse Ethics (CE), has primarily been discussed in natural language without a formal mathematical foundation. This paper introduces Coarse Set Theory (CST) to establish a mathematical framework for CE. We define coarse sets using totally ordered sets and propose axioms that characterize the hierarchical relationships between elements and their groupings. Additionally, we introduce coarse-grained sets, which partition an underlying set into equivalence classes based on predefined criteria. We extend this framework by defining coarse mappings, which transform detailed individual data into coarser representations while maintaining essential structural properties. To measure the information loss, we employ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, demonstrating how different coarse partitions affect the preservation of information. We illustrate how CST can be applied to real-world grading systems through theoretical formulations and empirical analysis. This study provides a rigorous foundation for CE, enabling a more systematic exploration of fairness, interpretability, and decision-making trade-offs.</description>

      <title>The Difference Kapranov Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper creates a link between \textit{Tropical Geometry} and \textit{Difference Algebra}. The main result is a difference version of \textit{Kapranov's Theorem}. In this theorem, we extend Kapranov's Theorem to the case of a Laurent difference polynomial with coefficients from a multiplicative valued difference field, where the residue field is an algebraically closed field with a generic automorphism (ACFA). A result of this paper that plays a critical role in the proof of the Difference Kapranov Theorem is a difference version of \textit{Newton's Lemma}.</description>

      <title>The construction principle and non homogeneity of uncountable relatively free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [11] Sklinos proved that any uncountable free group is not $\aleph_1$-homogenenous. This was later generalized by Belegradek in [1] to torsion-free residually finite relatively free groups, leaving open whether the assumption of residual finiteness was necessary. In this paper we use methods arising from the classical analysis of relatively free groups in infinitary logic to answer Belegradek's question in the negative. Our methods are general and they also applications in varieties with torsion, for example we show that if $V$ contains a non-solvable group, then any uncountable $V$-free group is not $\aleph_1$-homogenenous.</description>

      <title>On definable J-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study definable J-sets for definable groups and compare them with weakly generic sets. We show that the property that J-sets coincide with weakly generic sets is invariant on enough saturated models, and hence a model-theoretical property. We have positive results for superstable commutative groups and some easy examples in pCF. We also give an example for noncoincidence.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Preservations of Ulam Stability-type Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show some preservation results of amenably extending strongly Ulam stable groups under mild decay assumptions, including quantitative preservation of asymptotic bounds under the assumption that the modulus of stability is H\"older continuous of exponent $s&gt;\frac 1 2$ at 0, utilizing some simplistic integral estimates. Additionally, we show some partial results around inductive preservation of modulus bounds in infinite dimensions using these integral estimates, as well as strong quantitative preservation in the finite dimensional case. This implies the existence of $\mathfrak{U}$ uniformly stable existential closures among groups with sufficiently large Lipschitz estimates of any countable group. Finally, we show quantitative control preserving difficulty of approximation of maps over stable groups on diagonally embedding into higher dimensions.</description>
