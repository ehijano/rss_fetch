      <title>Cosmological implications of the minimum viscosity principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that black holes in a quark gluon plasma (QGP) obeying minimum viscosity bounds, exhibit a Schwarzschild radius in close match with the range of the strong force. For such black holes, an evaporation time of about 1016 secs is estimated, indicating that they would survive by far the quark-gluon plasma era, namely between 10^-10 and 10^-6 seconds after the big bang. On the assumption that the big-bang generated unequal amounts of quark and antiquarks, this suggests that such unbalance might have survived to this day in the form of excess antiquark nuggets hidden to all but gravitational interactions. A connection with the saturon picture, whereby minimum viscosity regimes would associate with the onset coherent quantum field structures with maximum storage properties, is also established, along with potential implication for quantum computing of classical systems.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual of defect CFT with corner contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study defect CFT within the framework of holographic duality, emphasizing the impact of corner contributions. We model distinct conformal defects using interface branes that differ in tensions and are connected by a corner. Employing the relationship between CFT scaling dimensions and Euclidean gravity actions, we outline a general procedure for calculating the anomalous dimensions of defect changing operators at nontrivial cusps. Several analytical results are obtained, including the cusp anomalous dimensions at big and small angles. While $1/\phi$ universal divergence appears for small cusp angles due to the fusion of two defects, more interestingly, we uncover a bubble phase rendered by a near zero angle cusp, in which the divergence is absent.</description>

      <title>Spinning Black Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$: Casimir Terms, Radial Action and Hidden Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve subtleties in calculating the post-Minksowskian dynamics of binary systems, as a spin expansion, from massive scattering amplitudes of fixed finite spin. In particular, the apparently ambiguous spin Casimir terms can be fully determined from the gradient of the spin-diagonal part of the amplitudes with respect to $S^2 = -s(s+1)\hbar^2$, using an interpolation between massive amplitudes with different spin representations. From two-loop amplitudes of spin-0 and spin-1 particles minimally coupled to gravity, we extract the spin Casimir terms in the conservative scattering angle between a spinless and a spinning black hole at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$, finding agreement with known results in the literature. This completes an earlier study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 (2023), 021601] that calculated the non-Casimir terms from amplitudes. We also illustrate our methods using a model of spinning bodies in electrodynamics, finding agreement between scattering amplitude predictions and classical predictions in a root-Kerr electromagnetic background up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^3 S^2)$. For both gravity and electrodynamics, the finite part of the amplitude coincides with the two-body radial action in the aligned spin limit, generalizing the amplitude-action relation beyond the spinless case. Surprisingly, the two-loop amplitude displays a hidden spin-shift symmetry in the probe limit, which was previously observed at one loop. We conjecture that the symmetry holds to all orders in the coupling constant and is a consequence of integrability of Kerr orbits in the probe limit at the first few orders in spin.</description>

      <title>On Formulating the Non-Geometric Scalar Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of four-dimensional type II supergravities, the successive application of various S/T-dualities leads to a generalized notion of fluxes, which includes certain (non-)geometric fluxes along with the standard RR and NS-NS p-form fluxes. These fluxes induce a diverse set of superpotential couplings leading to scalar potentials with a very rich structure, which may possibly result in a vast landscape of physical vacua. However such scalar potentials typically consist of a huge number of terms and in order to make any attempt for phenomenological model building with some analytic understanding/control it is necessary to formulate them in some compact and concise form. Along these lines we review various equivalent methods of deriving the same scalar potential through a set of master formulae, which may open up a new avenue for model building using non-geometric fluxes.</description>

      <title>BPS Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are chaotic quantum systems that are expected to exhibit random matrix statistics in their finite energy spectrum. Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg and Shan (LMRS) have proposed a related characterization of chaos for the ground states of BPS black holes with finite area horizons. On a separate front, the "fuzzball program" has uncovered large families of horizon-free geometries that account for the entropy of holographic BPS systems, but only in situations with sufficient supersymmetry to exclude finite area horizons. The highly structured, non-random nature of these solutions seems in tension with strong chaos. We verify this intuition by performing analytic and numerical calculations of the LMRS diagnostic in the corresponding boundary quantum system. In particular we examine the 1/2 and 1/4-BPS sectors of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, and the two charge sector of the D1-D5 CFT. We find evidence that these systems are only weakly chaotic, with a Thouless time determining the onset of chaos that grows as a power of $N$. In contrast, finite horizon area BPS black holes should be strongly chaotic, with a Thouless time of order one. In this case, finite energy chaotic states become BPS as $N$ is decreased through the recently discovered "fortuity" mechanism. Hence they can plausibly retain their strongly chaotic character.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixings in String Theory with Dirac Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the most realistic class of models among the 33 candidates in the complete landscape of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models arising from intersecting D6-branes on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in type IIA string theory. The class is characterized by twelve Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector that precisely account for the Standard Model fermion masses and mixings without Wilson fluxes. Notably, there is a natural prediction of Dirac neutrino-masses with normal ordering $(50.4,~10.5,~6.1)$~meV consistent with both experimental constraints and swampland bounds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Symmetries in the TsT/$T\bar{T}$ Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from holography for IIB string theory on AdS$_3\times \mathcal N$ with NS-NS flux, the TsT/$T\bar T$ correspondence is a conjecture that a TsT transformation on the string theory side is holographically dual to the single-trace version of the $T\bar T$ deformation on the field theory side. More precisely, the long string sector of string theory on the TsT-transformed background corresponds to the symmetric product theory whose seed theory is the $T\bar T$-deformed CFT$_2$. In this paper, we study the asymptotic symmetry of the string theory in the bulk. We find a state-dependent, non-local field redefinition under which the worldsheet equations of motion, stress tensor, as well as the symplectic form of string theory after the TsT transformation are mapped to those before the TsT transformation. The asymptotic symmetry in the auxiliary AdS basis is generated by two commuting Virasoro generators, while in the TsT transformed basis is non-linear and non-local. Our result from string theory analysis is compatible with that of the $T\bar T$ deformed CFT$_2$.</description>

      <title>Formulating Schwinger--Dyson equations for QED propagators in Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwinger--Dyson equations (SDEs) are coupled integral equations for the Green's functions of a quantum field theory (QFT). The SDE approach is the analytic nonperturbative method for solving strongly coupled QFTs. When applied to QCD, this approach, also based on the first principle, is the analytic alternative to lattice QCD. However, the SDEs for the n-point Green's functions involves (n+1)-point Green's functions (sometimes (n+2)-point functions as well). Therefore any practical method for solving this infinitely coupled system of equations requires a truncation scheme. When considering strongly coupled QED as a modeling of QCD, naive truncation schemes violate various principles of the gauge theory. These principles include gauge invariance, gauge covariance, and multiplicative renormalizability. The combination of dimensional regularization with the spectral representation of propagators results in a tractable formulation of a truncation scheme for the SDEs of QED propagators, which has the potential to preserve the aforementioned principles and renders solutions obtainable in the Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Proving the absence of large one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation within the path-integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations $\zeta$ in an inflationary scenario containing a transient ultra-slow-roll (USR) period. In Ref.[1], it was argued that one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of $\zeta$ can be larger than the tree-level one within the parameter region generating the seeds of primordial black holes during the USR epoch, which implies the breakdown of perturbation theory. We prove that this is not the case by using a master formula for one-loop corrections to the power spectrum obtained in Ref.[2]. We derive the same formula within the path-integral formalism, which is simpler than the original derivation in [2]. To show the smallness of one-loop corrections, the consistency relations and the effective constancy of tree-level mode functions of $\zeta$ for super-Hubble modes play essential roles, with which the master formula gives a simple expression for one-loop corrections. For concreteness, we provide a reduced set of interactions including the leading-order one, while establishing the consistency relations in a self-consistent manner. We also show how the consistency relations of various operators hold explicitly, which plays a key role in proving the absence of large one-loop corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a geometric description of foams, which are prevalent in topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) based on quantum algebra, and reciprocally explore the geometry of Rozansky-Witten (RW) theory from an algebraic perspective. This approach illuminates various aspects of decorated TQFTs via geometry of the target space $X$ of RW theory. Through the formulation of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation within this geometric framework, we derive the corresponding braiding and associator morphisms. We discuss applications where the target space of RW theory emerges as the Coulomb branch of a compactified 6d SCFT or Little String Theory, with the latter being particularly intriguing as it results in a compact $X$.</description>

      <title>Strong rapid turn inflation and contact Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the consistency condition for ``strong'' sustained rapid turn inflation with third order slow roll (SRRT) in two-field cosmological models with oriented scalar manifold as a geometric PDE which constrains the metric and potential of such models. When supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions, the equation determines one of these objects in terms of the other and hence selects ``fiducial'' models for strong SRRT inflation. When the scalar potential is given, the equation can be simplified by fixing the conformal class of the scalar field metric (equivalently, fixing a complex structure which makes the scalar manifold into a complex Riemann surface). Then the consistency equation becomes a contact Hamilton-Jacobi PDE which determines the scalar field metric within the given conformal class. We analyze this equation with standard methods of PDE theory, discuss its approximation near a nondegenerate critical point of the scalar potential and extract natural asymptotic conditions for its solutions at such points. We also give numerical examples of solutions to a simple Dirichlet problem. For the case of elliptic curves relevant to two-field axion cosmology, we determine the general symmetry-adapted solution of the equation for potentials with a single charge vector.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial and Algebraic Mutations of Toric Fano 3-folds and Mass Deformations of 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that algebraic and combinatorial polytope mutations of Fano 3-folds can be identified with mass deformations of associated 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories realized by brane brick models. These are Type IIA brane configurations that realize a large family of 2d worldvolume theories on probe D1-branes at toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. We show that brane brick models that are related by mass deformations associated to algebraic and combinatorial polytope mutations of Fano 3-folds have mesonic moduli spaces with the same number of generators. We show that mesonic flavor charges of these generators form convex reflexive lattice polytopes that are dual to the toric diagrams of the Fano 3-folds. The generating function of mesonic gauge invariant operators, also known as the Hilbert series of the mesonic moduli space, appears to be identical for such brane brick models under a particular refinement originating from the U(1)_R charges in the brane brick model following the mass deformation.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy of Non--Supersymmetric $\bm{\tilde{S}}$ Heterotic String Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the free fermionic formulation of the heterotic-string in four dimensions to study the vacuum structure and energy of non-supersymmetric tachyon free models that correspond to compactifications of tachyonic vacua of the ten dimensional heterotic-string. We explore the class of heterotic $SO(10)$ non-supersymmetric models constructed from the $\tilde{S}$-model in the Free Fermionic Formalism, and investigate the dependence of the potential on the geometric moduli. This paper will explore a sample of $ 10^{9}$ string vacua to find the frequency of viable models, classifying these vacua by the following fertility criteria: tachyon presence; number of spinorial $\boldsymbol{16/\overline{16}}$ representations; vectorial $\boldsymbol{10}$ states; Top Quark Mass Coupling compatibility. Of these we find those that mimic supersymmetric models with equal number of bosons and fermions at the massless level - $a_{00} = 0$. Tachyon free models occur with a frequency of $5.309\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, models that fulfil the rest of the phenomenological fertility conditions and the additional condition on $a_{00}$ occur with probability $4.0 \times 10^{-9}$ We analyse the partition functions and study the moduli dependence of such models, finding that almost all fertile models have finite, positive potential at the Free Fermionic Point, with $2$ out of $84$ of the fertile cores having negative, finite potential. We demonstratate that the Free Fermionic Point is not necessarily a minimum in the potential. This work provides further evidence that supersymmetry may not be a necessary ingredient of phenomenological models, recreating many of the desirable features of such models without employing supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Stability and topological nature of charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the thermodynamic characteristics and phase structures of a black hole, where the black hole horizon could be a hypersurface with positive, zero, or negative constant curvature, within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell theory, incorporating a negative cosmological constant and a Gauss-Bonnet correction. Our research follows the topological approach to black hole thermodynamics where we treat anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes as topological defects in thermodynamic space. We study the nature of the black hole's critical points and local stability by computing the winding numbers/topological charge associated with the zero point of the vector field, derived from the temperature of extremal points and generalized off-shell Gibbs free energy, respectively. Black holes are classified into different topological classes based on their topological number. In this study, we found unlike the charged AdS black hole, the charged GB AdS black hole exhibits a critical point. Our findings reveal the occurrence of a liquid/gas-like first-order phase transition between small-large black hole phases of the spherical charged GB AdS black hole. We conclude that the charged GB AdS and charged AdS black holes belong to different topological classes in the grand canonical ensemble. Furthermore, connecting with the previous studies, we conclude that the charged AdS and charged GB AdS black holes in canonical and charged GB in the grand canonical ensemble belong to the same topological classes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic helicity flux operators in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The helicity flux operator is a fascinating quantity that characterizes the angular distribution of the helicity of radiative photons or gravitons and it has many interesting physical consequences. In this paper, we construct the electromagnetic helicity flux operators which form a non-Abelian group in general dimensions, among which the minimal helicity flux operators form the massless representation of the little group, a finite spin unitary irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group. As in four dimensions, they generate an extended angle-dependent transformation on the Carrollian manifold. Interestingly, there is no known corresponding bulk duality transformation in general dimensions. However, we can construct a topological Chern-Simons term that evaluates the minimal helicity flux operators at $\mathcal{I}^+$.</description>

      <title>Analytic Evaluation of Multiple Mellin-Barnes Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize two geometrical approaches to analytically evaluate higher-fold Mellin-Barnes (MB) integrals in terms of hypergeometric functions. The first method is based on intersections of conic hulls, while the second one, which is more recent, relies on triangulations of a set of points. We demonstrate that, once automatized, the triangulation approach is computationally more efficient than the conic hull approach. As an application of this triangulation approach, we describe how one can derive simpler hypergeometric solutions of the conformal off-shell massless two-loop double box and one-loop hexagon Feynman integrals than those previously obtained from the conic hull approach. Lastly, by applying the above techniques on the MB representation of multiple polylogarithms, we show how to obtain new convergent series representations for these functions. These new analytic expressions were numerically cross-checked with GINAC.</description>

      <title>On the EFT of Dyon-Monopole Catalysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monopole-fermion (and dyon-fermion) interactions provide a famous example where scattering from a compact object gives a cross section much larger than the object's geometrical size. This underlies the phenomenon of monopole catalysis of baryon-number violation because the reaction rate is much larger in the presence of a monopole than in its absence. It is sometimes claimed to violate the otherwise generic requirement that short distance physics decouples from long-distance observables -- a property that underpins the general utility of effective field theory (EFT) methods. Decoupling in this context is most simply expressed using point-particle effective field theories (PPEFTs) designed to capture systematically how small but massive objects influence their surroundings when probed only on length scales large compared to their size. These have been tested in precision calculations of how nuclear properties affect atomic energy levels for both ordinary and pionic atoms. We adapt the PPEFT formalism to describe low-energy $S$-wave dyon-fermion scattering with a view to understanding whether large catalysis cross sections violate decoupling (and show why they do not). We also explore the related but separate issue of the long-distance complications associated with polarizing the fermion vacuum exterior to a dyon and show in some circumstances how PPEFT methods can simplify calculations of low-energy fermion-dyon scattering in their presence. We propose an effective Hamiltonian governing how dyon excitations respond to fermion scattering in terms of a time-dependent vacuum angle and outline open questions remaining in its microscopic derivation.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Formulation of Compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory is a topological quantum field theory with numerous applications in condensed matter and high-energy physics, including the study of anomalies, fermion/boson dualities, and the fractional quantum Hall effect. In this work, a Hamiltonian lattice formulation for 2+1D compact Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is derived. We analytically solve this theory and demonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known continuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the quantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates, and the non-trivial properties of Wilson loops. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based simulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Higgs system in the framework of Bondi coordinates. As a first step, the problem is reduced to a single first-order integro-differential equation by defining a generalized ansatz function. Then, we employ contraction mapping to show that there exists the unique fixed point of the problem. For a given small initial data, we prove the existence of a global classical solution. Finally, by introducing local mass and local charge functions in higher dimensions, we also show the completeness property of the spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: Extreme mass-ratio limit and final memory offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect is a strong-field relativistic phenomenon that is associated with a persistent change in the GW strain after the passage of a GW. The nonlinear effect arises from interactions of GWs themselves in the wave zone and is an observable effect connected to the infrared properties of general relativity. The detection of the GW memory effect is possible with LIGO and Virgo in a population of binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers or from individual events with next-generation ground- and space-based GW detectors or pulsar timing arrays. Matched-filtering-based searches for the GW memory require accurate, and preferably rapid-to-evaluate waveform models of the memory effect's GW signal. One important element of such a waveform model is a model for the final memory offset -- namely, the net change in strain between early and late times. In this paper, we construct a model for the final memory offset from the merger of nonspinning BBH systems in quasicircular orbits. A novel ingredient of this model is that we first compute the memory signal for extreme mass-ratio inspirals using a high post-Newtonian-order analytic calculation, and we use this analytical result to fix the coefficient in the fit which is linear in the mass-ratio. The resulting memory-offset fit could be used for detecting the GW memory for binaries that merge on a timescale that is short relative to the inverse of the low-frequency cutoff of a GW detector. Additionally, this fit will be useful for analytic waveform models of the GW memory signals in the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Theoretical underpinnings of CP-Violation at the High-energy Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general analysis for the discovery potential of CP-violation (CPV) searches in scattering processes at TeV-scale colliders in an effective field theory framework, using the SMEFT basis for higher dimensional operators. In particular, we systematically examine the CP-violating sector of the SMEFT framework in some well motivated limiting cases, based on flavour symmetries of the underlying heavy theory. We show that, under naturality arguments of the underlying new physics (NP) and in the absence of (or suppressed) flavour-changing interactions, there is only a single operator, $Q_{t\phi} = \phi^\dagger \phi \left(\bar q_3 t \right) \tilde{\phi} $ which alters the top-Yukawa coupling, that can generate a non-vanishing CP-violating effect from tree-level SM$\times$NP interference terms. We find, however, that CPV from $Q_{t\phi} = \phi^\dagger \phi \left(\bar q_3 t \right) \tilde{\phi} $ is expected to be at best of $O(1\%)$ and, therefore, very challenging if at all measurable at the LHC or other future high-energy colliders. We then conclude that a potentially measurable CP-violating effect of $O(10\%)$ can arise in high-energy scattering processes ONLY if flavour-changing interactions are present in the underlying NP; in this case a sizable CPV can be generated at the tree-level by pure NP$\times$NP effects and not from SM$\times$NP interference. We provide several examples of CPV at the LHC and at a future $e^+e^-$ collider to support these statements.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Field Theory Simulations on NISQ Devices with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Spin foams arose as the covariant (path integral) formulation of quantum gravity depicting transition amplitudes between different quantum geometry states. As such, they provide a scheme to study the no boundary proposal, specifically the nothing to something transition and compute relevant observables using high performance computing (HPC). Following recent advances, where stochastic algorithms (Markov Chain Monte Carlo-MCMC) were used, we employ Generative Flow Networks, a newly developed machine learning algorithm to compute the expectation value of the dihedral angle for a 4-simplex and compare the results with previous works.</description>

Abstract: The incompatibility of explicit diffeomorphism violation with Riemannian geometry within the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME) is revisited. We review two methods of how to deal with this problem. The first is based on an approach proposed originally by St\"{u}ckelberg and the latter is to restrict spacetime geometry via the dynamical field equations and the second Bianchi identity. Moreover, a third technique is introduced, which is novel and relies on isometries of a gravitational system. Our conclusion is that an SME background field configuration compatible with Riemannian geometry is more likely to be determined the more diffeomorphisms are isometries of the particular system. This finding has the potential to provide an alternative treatment of explicit spacetime symmetry violation in gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field in the background of a large class of quantum black holes that can be formed from gravitational collapse of a dust fluid in the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. The loop quantum black holes (LQBHs) are characterized by three free parameters, one of which is the mass parameter, while the other two are purely due to quantum geometric effects. Among these two quantum parameters, one is completely fixed by black hole thermodynamics and its effects are negligible for macroscopic black holes, while the second parameter is completely free (in principle). In the studies of the QNMs of such LQBHs, we pay particular attention to the difference of the QNMs between LQBHs and classical ones, so that they can be observed for the current and forthcoming gravitational wave observations, whereby place the LQBH theory directly under the test of observations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and phase transition of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a generalized parameter space, regular black holes can be regarded as non-singular solutions under specific parameters in Einstein gravity theory coupled with non-linear electromagnetic fields. Following this concept, we investigate the thermodynamic states and phase transitions of Bardeen-AdS-class black holes, revealing that the system can be classified into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on whether it adopts a pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime without event horizons or a Bardeen-AdS black hole as its phase state, each exhibiting distinct thermodynamic properties. If one includes the Bardeen-AdS black holes in the system (Type I), there will be three distinct black hole states and the phase transitions between them are analogous to the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes. On the other hand, if the pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime is included (Type II), an additional tiny black hole state emerges. A phase transition reminiscent of the Hawking-Page transition was found. Significantly, in this scenario, thermodynamical characteristic curves exhibit discontinuous behavior, which attributes to the multiple horizons. The presence of a Bardeen-AdS black hole within the phase structure of the Bardeen-AdS-class black hole profoundly modifies the thermodynamical properties of the system, highlighting the novel aspects of regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of black holes: relating the frequency domain to the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes is unstable under small perturbations (of order $\epsilon$) of the radial potential, while the early time-domain ringdown waveform is only marginally affected. In this paper we provide further insight into the apparent tension between the frequency-domain and the time-domain descriptions by analyzing the scattering properties of the problem. In the frequency domain, we study analytically the solutions corresponding to the perturbed potential. We show that there are two qualitatively different classes of instabilities, and that both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are affected by what we call a "Type II" instability, i.e., an exponential migration of the mode frequencies away from their unperturbed value as the perturbing "bump" moves away from the peak of the unperturbed potential. In the time domain, we elucidate the effect of the spectral instability in terms of the causal structure of the Green's function. By using an equivalent scattering problem we confirm analytically (and show numerically) that the deviation from the unperturbed waveform in the early ringdown stage is proportional to $\epsilon$ when $\epsilon\lesssim10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo bound for curves in projective 3-folds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Castelnuovo bound conjecture, which is proposed by physicists, predicts an effective vanishing result for Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one. Previously, it is only known for a few cases and all the proofs rely on the Bogomolov-Gieseker conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda.
  In this paper, we prove the Castelnuovo bound conjecture for any Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one, up to a linear term and finitely many degree, without assuming the conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda. Furthermore, we prove an effective vanishing theorem for surface-counting invariants of Calabi-Yau 4-folds of Picard number one. We also apply our techniques to study low-degree curves on some explicit Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
  Our approach is based on a general iterative method to obtain upper bounds for the genus of one-dimensional closed subschemes in a fixed 3-fold, which is a combination of classical techniques and the wall-crossing of weak stability conditions on derived categories, and works for any projective 3-fold with at worst isolated singularities over any algebraically closed field.</description>

      <title>Symplectic formulation of the type IIB scalar potential with U-dual fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a symplectic formulation of the $N =1$ four-dimensional type IIB scalar potential arising from a flux superpotential which has four S-dual pairs of fluxes demanded by the U-dual completion arguments. Our symplectic formulation presents a very compact and concise way of expressing the generic scalar potential in just a few terms via using a set of symplectic identities along with the so-called "axionic-flux" combinations. We demonstrate the utility of our symplectic master-formula by considering an underlying four-dimensional type IIB supergravity model based on a ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2)$ orientifold, in which the scalar potential induced by the U-dual flux superpotential results in a total of 76276 terms involving 128 flux parameters. Given that our symplectic formulation does not need the information about the metric of the internal background, it is applicable to the models beyond the toroidal compactifications such as to those which use orientifolds of the Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>A multiverse model in dS wedge holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a multiverse model based on a recent proposal for dS wedge holography, where empty AdS$_3$ space is cut off by a pair of accelerated dS$_2$ space universes, one near the AdS boundary, denoted the UV brane, and one in the AdS interior, the IR brane. We glue together several copies of this configuration along the UV and IR branes in a periodic matter. To provide the model with dynamics of the like near Nariai black holes used in other multiverse toy models, we add dS JT gravity as an intrinsic gravity theory on the IR branes. We then study the entanglement entropy with respect to a UV brane observer, who finds a Page curve transition due to an entanglement island connecting the UV and IR branes. This process involves the coarse-graining of information outside the causally accessible region to the observer. Our model provides an explicit realization of entanglement between IR and UV degrees of freedom encoded in the multiverse.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scaling Dimension from the Equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to constrain the scaling dimension of the operators of the strongly interacting systems (SIS) using the holographic setup. %where the (d+1)-dimensional black hole is used to describe the d-dimensional SIS.
  We demonstrate our method using the holographic superconductor theory. The idea is to consider the inside as well as the outside of the AdS black hole in which the gap equations has higher order singularities. Then the equivalence principle requests the solution be smoothly connected at the horizon, which request the vanishing of log divergent term as well as an indefinite conditionally convergent terms that can lead to any real number according to Riemann.
  As a result, one gets quantized values of the scaling dimension of the condensing operator. This is a pleasant surprise because so far one gets the constraints on the scaling dimension only by a hard analysis with bootstrap ansatz.</description>

      <title>Presymplectic minimal models of local gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on the recently proposed notion of a weak presymplectic gauge PDE. It is a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded bundle over the space-time manifold, equipped with a degree $1$ vector field and a compatible graded presymplectic structure. This geometrical data naturally defines a Lagrangian gauge field theory. Moreover, it encodes not only the Lagrangian of the theory but also its full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation. In particular, the respective field-antifield space arises as a symplectic quotient of the super-jet bundle of the initial fiber bundle. A remarkable property of this approach is that among the variety of presymplectic gauge PDEs encoding a given gauge theory we can pick a minimal one that usually turns out to be finite-dimensional, and unique in a certain sense. The approach can be considered as an extension of the familiar AKSZ construction to not necessarily topological and diffeomorphism-invariant theories. We present a variety of examples including $p$-forms, chiral Yang-Mills theory, Holst gravity, and conformal gravity. We also explain the explicit relation to the non-BV-BRST version of the formalism, which happens to be closely related to the covariant phase space and the multisymplectic approaches.</description>

Abstract: Field transformations for the quantum effective action lead to different pictures of a given physical situation, as describing a given evolution of the universe by different geometries. Field transformations for functional flow equations can reveal important physical features, as the appearance of bound states. They also allow for technical simplifications. We make a critical assessment of the virtues and shortcomings of different versions of field transformations. Key issues are demonstrated by the quantum field theory for scalars with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term. Our findings confirm the principle of field relativity for gravity and cosmology based on the quantum effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers of rotating charged AdS black holes in both four- and five-dimensional gauged supergravity theories. Our analysis is conducted within the framework of the thermodynamical topological approach to black holes, utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy. We demonstrate that the number of rotation parameters plays a significant role in determining the topological numbers of five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes. Moreover, our findings indicate that the topological numbers of both four- and five-dimensional rotating AdS black holes are not influenced by the number of electric charge parameters. This highlights a distinct difference in how rotation and electric charge parameters impact the thermodynamic topological properties of these black holes.</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved U(1) charge, whose basic degrees of freedom are canonical bosons. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- the first microscopic model that realizes the near-CFT$_1$ dynamics -- is based on random $p$-local interactions among fermions. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Our construction is based on a recent insight that near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. All such models are essentially solved by chord diagrams regardless of the nature of the underlying degrees of freedom. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from. We also show the level statistics of both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energies.</description>

      <title>Heavy States in 3d Gravity and 2d CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss correlators of light fields in heavy states in 3d gravity and holographic 2d CFTs. In the bulk, the propagator of free fields in AdS backgrounds containing a conical defect or a BTZ black hole can be obtained by solving the wave equation, as well as by the method of images. On the boundary, these geometries are sourced by heavy operator insertions, and the propagator is dual to a heavy-light (HHLL) correlator. By matching its expansion in Virasoro blocks to our bulk results, we determine the OPE coefficients of all contributing states in both the s and t channels. In the s channel, these states are excitations of the light field on top of the heavy state, and their OPE coefficients are the amplitudes to create them. The t-channel OPE is dominated by the Virasoro vacuum block, but there is also an infinite family of light two-particle states that contribute to the correlator. The OPE coefficients that couple these states to heavy operators represent their expectation values in heavy backgrounds. We determine them exactly, derive their asymptotic form at large twist, and discuss their behavior near and above the BTZ threshold, where they become thermal one-point functions.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to compute Compton amplitudes involving a fermion pair inspired by Hopf algebra amplitude constructions. This approach features a recursive relation employing quasi-shuffle sets, directly verifiable by massive factorization properties. We derive results for minimal gauge invariant color-kinematic numerators with physical massive poles using this method. We have also deduced a graphical method for deriving numerators that simplifies the numerator generation and eliminates redundancies, thus providing several computational advantages.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the perturbative stability of Euclidean axion wormholes. The quadratic action that governs linear perturbations is derived directly in Euclidean gravity. We demonstrate explicitly that a stability analysis in which one treats the axion as a normal two-form gauge field is equivalent to one performed in the Hodge-dual formulation, where one considers the axion as a scalar with a wrong-sign kinetic term. Both analyses indicate that axion wormholes are perturbatively stable, even in the presence of a massless dilaton, or saxion, field that couples to the axion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present three new families of smooth Type II string theory backgrounds. These are dual to supersymmetry-preserving deformations of 4d SCFTs. The deformations include a VEV for a global current and a `twisted compactification' on a circle. We study various holographic aspects of the dual QFTs, focusing on Wilson loops and Entanglement Entropy. Additionally, we present a monotonic quantity calculating the density of degrees of freedom in terms of the energy, which interpolates between the IR 3d gapped theory and the 4d SCFT result. Other probes related to global aspects of the QFTs are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to include the effect of high energy and topological parameters on black holes in $F(R)$ gravity, we consider two corrections to this gravity: energy-dependent spacetime with different topological constants, and a nonlinear electrodynamics field. In other words, we combine $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow with ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics theory to see the effects of high energy and topological parameters on the physics of black holes. For this purpose, we first extract topological black hole solutions in $F(R)$% -ModMax gravity's rainbow. Then, by considering black holes as thermodynamic systems, we obtain thermodynamic quantities and check the first law of thermodynamics. The effect of the topological parameter on the Hawking temperature and the total mass of black holes is obvious. We also discuss the thermodynamic topology of topological black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow using the off-shell free energy method. In this formalism, black holes are assumed to be equivalent to defects in their thermodynamic spaces. For our analysis, we consider two different types of thermodynamic ensembles. These are: fixed $q$ ensemble and fixed $\phi$ ensemble. We take into account all the different types of curvature hypersurfaces that can be constructed in these black holes. The local and global topology of these black holes are studied by computing the topological charges at the defects in their thermodynamic spaces. Finally, in accordance with their topological charges, we classify the black holes into three topological classes with total winding numbers corresponding to $-1, 0$, and $1$. We observe that the topological classes of these black holes are dependent on the value of the rainbow function, the sign of the scalar curvature, and the choice of ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Isospectrality in Effective Field Theory Extensions of General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two universal predictions of general relativity are the propagation of gravitational waves of large momentum along null geodesics and the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in many families of black holes. In extensions of general relativity, these properties are typically lost: quasinormal modes are no longer isospectral and gravitational wave propagation is no longer geodesic and it exhibits birefringence -- polarization-dependent speed. We study these effects in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with up to eight-derivative terms and show that there is a unique Lagrangian that has a non-birefringent dispersion relation for gravitational waves and isospectral quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit. We argue that both properties are related through a generalized correspondence between eikonal quasinormal modes and unstable photon-sphere orbits. These properties define a special class of theories that we denote as isospectral effective field theories. We note that the lowest-order isospectral correction to general relativity coincides with the quartic-curvature correction arising from type II string theory, suggesting that isospectrality might be a key feature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Reading-off the non-geometric scalar potentials with U-dual fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of four-dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ type IIB superstring compactifications, the U-dual completion of the holomorphic flux superpotential leads to four S-dual pairs of fluxes, namely $(F, H), (Q, P), (P', Q')$ and $(H', F')$. It has been observed that the scalar potentials induced by such generalized superpotentials typically have an enormous amount of terms, making it hard to study any phenomenological aspects such as moduli stabilization. In this regard, we present a set of generic master formulae which not only formulate the scalar potential in a compact way but also enable one to {\it read-off} the various scalar potential pieces by simply knowing a set of topological data of the compactifying Calabi Yau and its mirror threefold. We demonstrate the applicability of our master formulae by {\it reading-off} the scalar potentials for five explicit models, and using a set of {\it axionic flux} combinations we show that 76276 terms arising from the flux superpotential in a ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2)$-based model can be equivalently expressed by using 2816 terms, while 11212 terms arising from the flux superpotential in a Quintic-based model can be equivalently expressed by 668 terms! We argue that the master formulae presented in this work can be useful in an analytic exploration of the rich landscape of the non-geometric flux vacua.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the action principle for the holographic $T\bar{T}$-deformation. We develop a scheme in which one can holographically reproduce the action of the Liouville theory deformed by $T\bar{T}$-insertion. This scheme necessitates considering the bending energy of the finite cut-off surface. Following our proposal, one observes a perfect match between the actions of deformed theory on the field theory and gravity sides.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

Abstract: In 2015, Codesido-Grassi-Marino laid the foundation of a connection between local CY 3-folds and the spectra of operators attached to their mirror curves in the context of Topological String Theory. In a 2024 paper with C. Doran and M. Kerr, the author previously deduced two consequences of this conjecture; one relating zeroes of higher normal function to the spectra of operators of genus one curves, the other connecting integral regulators of $K_2$-classes on mirror curves to dilogarithm values at algebraic arguments. We now show that the latter continues to hold in the presence of a mass parameter, thus expanding the range of the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The affine Grassmannian associated to a reductive group $\mathbf{G}$ is an affine analogue of the usual flag varieties. It is a rich source of Poisson varieties and their symplectic resolutions. These spaces are examples of conical symplectic resolutions dual to the Nakajima quiver varieties. We study the cohomological stable envelopes of D. Maulik and A. Okounkov [arXiv:1211.1287] in this family. We construct an explicit recursive relation for the stable envelopes in the $\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{PSL}_2$ case and compute the first-order correction in the general case. This allows us to write an exact formula for multiplication by a divisor.</description>

      <title>Analytic Primordial Power Spectrum in the Dressed Metric Approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology and Thermodynamics of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectrum of cosmological tensor perturbations in the dressed metric approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. We compute the background-dependent effective mass that affects their propagation using the effective description of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that this mass can be approximated in different cosmological epochs by appropriate analytic functions. Moreover, in each of those epochs we can analytically solve the propagation of the perturbations, then obtaining the general solution globally by continuity requirements. On the other hand, since there are regimes far away from slow roll in the considered background evolution, the Bunch-Davies state does not provide a privileged choice of vacuum that would pick out a specific solution for the perturbations. Instead, we select the state of these perturbations by a recently proposed criterion that removes unwanted oscillations in the power spectrum. We compute the spectrum of this vacuum and compare it with other spectra obtained in the literature, especially with one corresponding to the hybrid approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. Finally, we notice that the same type of background dynamics is found in a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on thermodynamics, allowing in this case a free value for the tantamount of the critical density. Extending the dressed metric proposal to this phenomenological model, one might expect a similar form for the associated primordial power spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying \textit{multiple sharp transitions} (MSTs) under a unified framework, we investigate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and the production of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) by incorporating one-loop corrected renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum. With effective sound speed parameter, $1 \leq c_s \leq 1.17$, the direct consequence is the generation of PBH masses spanning $M_{\rm PBH}\sim{\cal O}(10^{-31}M_{\odot}- 10^{4}M_{\odot})$, thus evading well known \textit{No-go theorem} on PBH mass. Our results align coherently with the extensive NANOGrav 15-year data and the sensitivities outlined by other terrestrial and space-based experiments (e.g.: LISA, HLVK, BBO, HLV(O3), etc.).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the response tensors in planar Hall (or planar thermal Hall) configurations such that a three-dimensional Weyl or multi-Weyl semimetal is subjected to the influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and an effective magnetic field $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$, which are oriented at a generic angle with respect to each other. The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharply peaked quantum states are conjectured to be conducive to the notion of a quantum-corrected spacetime. We investigate this conjecture for a flat-FLRW model with perfect fluid, where a generalized ordering scheme is considered for the gravitational Hamiltonian. We study the implications of different ordering choices on the dynamics of the quantum universe. We demonstrate that the imprints of the operator ordering ambiguity are minimal, and quantum fluctuations are small in the case of sharply peaked states, leading to a consistent notion of a quantum-corrected spacetime defined via the expectation value of the scale factor. Surprisingly, the ordering imprints survive far away from the singularity through the quantum fluctuations in the quantum-corrected spacetime for broadly peaked states.</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity as a saviour for PBH overproduction in SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays for Galileon inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the explicit role of negative local non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, in suppressing the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the single-field model of Galileon inflation. PBH formation requires significantly enhancing the scalar power spectrum, which greatly affects their abundance. The associated frequencies in the nHz regime are also sensitive to the generation of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) which may explain the current data from the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Our analysis using the threshold statistics on the compaction function demonstrates that Galileon theory not only avoids PBH overproduction using the curvature perturbation enhancements that give $f_{\rm NL} \sim {\cal O}(-6)$, but also generates SIGWs that conform well with the PTA data.</description>

      <title>Persistent gravitational wave observables: Nonlinearities in (non-)geodesic deviation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The usual gravitational wave memory effect can be understood as a change in the separation of two initially comoving observers due to a burst of gravitational waves. Over the past few decades, a wide variety of other, "persistent" observables which measure permanent effects on idealized detectors have been introduced, each probing distinct physical effects. These observables can be defined in (regions of) any spacetime where there exists a notion of radiation, such as perturbation theory off of a fixed background, nonlinear plane wave spacetimes, or asymptotically flat spacetimes. Many of the persistent observables defined in the literature have only been considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes, and the perturbative nature of such calculations has occasionally obscured deeper relationships between these observables that hold more generally. The goal of this paper is to show how these more general results arise, and to do so we focus on two observables related to the separation between two, potentially accelerated observers. The first is the curve deviation, which is a natural generalization of the displacement memory, and also contains what this paper proposes to call drift memory (previously called "subleading displacement memory") and ballistic memory. The second is a relative proper time shift that arises between the two observers, either at second order in their initial separation and relative velocity, or in the presence of relative acceleration. The results of this paper are, where appropriate, entirely non-perturbative in the curvature of spacetime, and so could be used beyond leading order in asymptotically flat spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We propose a method to solve for the pseudoscalar bound state amplitude of a fermion and an antifermion from its Bethe--Salpeter equation (BSE) in the Minkowski space applying spectral representations. With the dressing of the fermion propagators specified by their spectral functions, we first derive the explicit expressions for the Nakanishi spectral functions of the Bethe--Salpeter wave function (BSWF) in terms of these propagators and the Bethe--Salpeter amplitude (BSA) directly from the definition in the momentum space. Applying the rainbow-ladder truncation in the covariant gauge, we then convert the BSE in the momentum space into identities that calculate the spectral functions of the BSA from those of the gauge-boson propagator and of the BSWF. These relations form a closed set of linear functionals for the Nakanishi spectral functions with analytical kernels, laying the foundation for the numerical solution of the BSE in the Minkowski space.</description>

Abstract: We present a set of example models in which the Standard Model (SM) symmetry group is extended by a new abelian symmetry. This additional symmetry appears anomalous in the effective low-energy theory; however, the anomalies cancel out when massive chiral fermions not present in the effective low-energy theory are taken into account. These chiral fermions under the new abelian gauge group, are chosen to be vector-like under the SM symmetries, and reside in the same representations as quarks and leptons. This allows us to quantitatively determine the magnitude of tree-level interactions between three vector bosons induced in low-energy effective field theory by the integration of chiral heavy fermions. We also examine the perturbativity constraints of the theory and the ultraviolet cut-off. We conclude by highlighting possible extensions of our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bounce cosmology to construct a singularity-free $f(\mathcal{R})$ model using the reconstruction technique. The formulation of the $f(\mathcal{R})$ model is based on the Raychaudhari equation, a key element employed in reconstructed models to eliminate singularities. We explore the feasibility of obtaining stable gravitational Lagrangians, adhering to the conditions $f_{\mathcal{R}}&gt;0$ and $f_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}&gt;0$. Consequently, both models demonstrate stability, effectively avoiding the Dolgov-Kawasaki instability. Our assessment extends to testing the reconstructed model using energy conditions and the effective equation-of-state (EoS). Our findings indicate that the reconstructed super-bounce model facilitates the examination of a singularity-free accelerating universe for both phantom and non-phantom phases. However, in the case of the reconstructed oscillatory bounce model, two scenarios are considered with $\omega=-1/3$ and $\omega=-2/3$. While the model proves suitable for studying a singular-free accelerating universe in the $\omega=-1/3$ case, it fails to demonstrate such behavior under energy conditions for the $\omega=-2/3$ scenario. The reconstructed models accommodate early-time bouncing behavior and late-</description>

      <title>The stochastic relativistic advection diffusion equation from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an approach to simulating the stochastic relativistic advection-diffusion equation based on the Metropolis algorithm. We show that the dissipative dynamics of the boosted fluctuating fluid can be simulated by making random transfers of charge between fluid cells, interspersed with ideal hydrodynamic time steps. The random charge transfers are accepted or rejected in a Metropolis step using the entropy as a statistical weight. This procedure reproduces the expected strains of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics in a specific (and non-covariant) hydrodynamic frame known as the density frame. Numerical results, both with and without noise, are presented and compared to relativistic kinetics and analytical expectations. An all order resummation of the density frame gradient expansion reproduces the covariant dynamics in a specific model. In contrast to all other numerical approaches to relativistic dissipative fluids, the dissipative fluid formalism presented here is strictly first order in gradients and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. The physical naturalness and simplicity of the Metropolis algorithm, together with its convergence properties, make it a promising tool for simulating stochastic relativistic fluids in heavy ion collisions and for critical phenomena in the relativistic domain.</description>

Utilizing a soft wall model for the QGP background and a massive vector field for the $J/\psi$ meson, we delve into the meson's spectral function and spin parameters $(\lambda_{\theta},\, \lambda_\varphi,\,\lambda_{\theta\varphi})$ for different cases, assessing their response to variations in magnetic field strength, momentum, and temperature. We initially examine scenarios where a meson's momentum aligns parallel to the magnetic field in helicity frame. Our results reveal a magnetic field-induced positive $\lambda_\theta^\text{H}$ for low meson momentum, transitioning to negative with increased momentum. As a comparison, we also study the case of momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field and find the direction of magnetic field does not affect the qualitative behavior for the $eB$-dependence of $\lambda_\theta^\text{H}$. Moreover, we apply our model to real heavy-ion collisions for three different spin quantization directions. Further comparisons with experimental data show qualitative agreement for spin parameters $\lambda_{\theta}$ and $\lambda_\varphi$ in the helicity and Collins-Soper frames.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Numerical relativity surrogate models for exotic compact objects: the case of head-on mergers of equal-mass Proca stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present several high-accuracy surrogate models for gravitational-wave signals from equal-mass head-on mergers of Proca stars, computed through the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$. We also discuss the current state of the model extensions to mergers of Proca stars with different masses, and the particular challenges that these present. The models are divided in two main categories: two-stage and monolithic. In the two-stage models, a dimensional reduction algorithm is applied to embed the data in a reduced feature space, which is then interpolated in terms of the physical parameters. For the monolithic models, a single neural network is trained to predict the waveform from the input physical parameter. Our model displays mismatches below $10^{-3}$ with respect to the original numerical waveforms. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our model in full Bayesian parameter inference through the accurate recovery of numerical relativity signals injected in zero-noise, together with the analysis of GW190521. For the latter, we observe excellent agreement with existing results that make use of full numerical relativity.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes in Modified Gravity using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply a novel approach based on physics-informed neural networks to the computation of quasinormal modes of black hole solutions in modified gravity. In particular, we focus on the case of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, with several choices of the coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. This type of calculation introduces a number of challenges with respect to the case of General Relativity, mainly due to the extra complexity of the perturbation equations and to the fact that the background solution is known only numerically. The solution of these perturbation equations typically requires sophisticated numerical techniques that are not easy to develop in computational codes. We show that physics-informed neural networks have an accuracy which is comparable to traditional numerical methods in the case of numerical backgrounds, while being very simple to implement. Additionally, the use of GPU parallelization is straightforward thanks to the use of standard machine learning environments.</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Hilltop Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve successful hilltop inflation in which the inflaton is identified as the modulus field in a modular invariant theory. The dilaton plays a crucial role in shaping the potential. Modular invariant gaugino condensation provides the mechanism for the modulus stabilisation after inflation. The inflationary trajectory lies on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain of the modulus field $\tau$. Inflation starts near the fixed point $\tau ={\rm i}$, and ends at a point near $\tau = \omega$, which is the global de Sitter vacuum. We investigate the allowed parameter space for successful modular invariant hilltop inflation.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory predicts, on purely geometric grounds, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N \approx 0.75$. This new "geometric" random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

      <title>Theoretical bounds on dark Higgs mass in a self-interacting dark matter model with $U(1)'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the null results of current dark matter searches and the small-scale problems, we study a dark sector charged by a spontaneous broken gauge $U(1)'$. To explore the parameter space of this model, in addition to the consideration of the small-scale data, we also consider the theoretical bounds on the dark Higgs mass, with the upper bound coming from the tree-level perturbative unitarity and the lower bound from the one-loop Linde-Weinberg bound. We deeply examine the dependence of the Linde-Weinberg bound on gauge choice and energy scale, and present a Linde-Weinberg bound that is gauge and scale independent. Combining the theoretical and observational constraints, we obtain the following ranges for the parameter space: the dark matter mass is 10-500 GeV, the mediator (dark photon) mass is 0.5-5 MeV, the dark Higgs mass is 0.05-50 MeV, and the dark fine-structure constant is 0.001-0.4. We conclude that the dark Higgs in this model cannot be ignored in the phenomenological study of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the invertible and non-invertible symmetries of topological finite group gauge theories in general spacetime dimensions, where the gauge group can be Abelian or non-Abelian. We focus in particular on the 0-form symmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified by boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We investigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other topological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped boundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples, including non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic duality symmetry in non-Abelian finite group gauge theories. In particular, we discover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d gauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the Cheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge groups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.</description>

Abstract: Topological field theories and holomorphic field theories naturally appear in both mathematics and physics. However, there exist intriguing hybrid theories that are topological in some directions and holomorphic in others, such as twists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we rigorously prove the ultraviolet (UV) finiteness for such hybrid theories on flat space, and present two significant vanishing results regarding anomalies.</description>

Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that this ambiguity can be solved in interacting field theories. We prove that the mean field limit of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions is equivalent to non-dissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor.</description>

Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the "modified" $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>
