      <title>Stability of Matrix Recurrence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the rich properties and various applications of recurrence relations, we consider the extension of traditional recurrence relations to matrices, where we use matrix multiplication and the Kronecker product to construct matrix sequences. We provide a sharp condition, which when satisfied, guarantees that any fixed-depth matrix recurrence relation defined over a product (with respect to matrix multiplication) will converge to the zero matrix. We also show that the same statement applies to matrix recurrence relations defined over a Kronecker product. Lastly, we show that the dual of this condition, which remains sharp, guarantees the divergence of matrix recurrence relations defined over a consecutive Kronecker product. These results completely determine the stability of nontrivial fixed-depth complex-valued recurrence relations defined over a consecutive product.</description>

      <title>On 2-complexes embeddable in 4-space, and the excluded minors of their underlying graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potentially undecidable problem of whether a given 2-dimensional CW complex can be embedded into $\mathbb{R}^4$. We provide operations that preserve embeddability, including joining and cloning of 2-cells, as well as $\Delta\mathrm Y$-transformations. We also construct a CW complex for which $\mathrm Y\Delta$-transformations do not preserve embeddability.
  We use these results to study 4-flat graphs, i.e., graphs that embed in $\mathbb{R}^4$ after attaching any number of 2-cells to their cycles; a graph class that naturally generalizes planarity and linklessness. We verify several conjectures of van der Holst; in particular, we prove that each of the 78 graphs of the Heawood family is an excluded minor for the class of 4-flat graphs.</description>

      <title>On graphs with chromatic number and maximum degree both equal to nine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equivalent version of the Borodin-Kostochka Conjecture, due to Cranston and Rabern, says that any graph with $\chi = \Delta = 9$ contains $K_3 \lor E_6$ as a subgraph. Here we prove several results in support of this conjecture, where vertex-criticality and forbidden substructure conditions get us either close or all the way to containing $K_3 \lor E_6$.</description>

      <title>Eulerian Directed Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\Delta$ a finite connected nontrivial directed multigraph, we prove:
  1. $\Delta$ has a directed circuit using each directed edge exactly once if and only if both each pair of distinct vertices of $\Delta$ occur in a common directed circuit and in-degree$({\bf x}) =$ out-degree$({\bf x})$ for every vertex ${\bf x}$.
  2. $\Delta$ contains a non-circuit directed path which uses every directed edge exactly once if and only if both every pair of distinct vertices of $\Delta$ occur in a common directed circuit and there are vertices ${\bf b \not= e}$ such that in-degree$({\bf e}) -$ out-degree$({\bf e}) = 1 =$ out-degree$({\bf b}) -$ in-degree$({\bf b})$ but, for every vertex ${\bf x \notin \{b,e\}}$, it happens that in-degree$({\bf x}) =$ out-degree$({\bf x})$.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the length of the longest path in random acyclic orientations of a complete bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomly sampling an acyclic orientation on the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,k}$ with parts of size $n$ and $k$, we investigate the length of the longest path. We provide a probability generating function for the distribution of the longest path length, and we use Analytic Combinatorics to perform asymptotic analysis of the probability distribution in the case of equal part sizes $n = k$ tending toward infinity. We show that the distribution is asymptotically Gaussian, and we obtain precise asymptotics for the mean and variance. These results address a question asked by Peter J. Cameron.
  Keywords: bipartite graph, directed graph, random graph, acyclic orientation, poly-Bernoulli numbers, lonesum matrices, generating function, analytic combinatorics, asymptotics.</description>

      <title>The domination polynomial of powers of paths and cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set in a graph is a set of vertices with the property that every vertex in the graph is either in the set or adjacent to something in the set. The domination sequence of the graph is the sequence whose $k$th term is the number of dominating sets of size $k$.
  Alikhani and Peng have conjectured that the domination sequence of every graph is unimodal. Beaton and Brown verified this conjecture for paths and cycles. Here we extend this to arbitrary powers of paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>Shelling of links and star clusters in edgewise subdivision of a simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate some combinatorial properties of the links and the star clusters of the faces in a concrete triangulation $T_{k,q}$ (the edgewise subdivision) of a $(k-1)$-simplex. We show that the link of a vertex in $T_{k,q}$ is the reduced order complexes of the product of chains and determine the number of combinatorially different links of all vertices of $T_{k,q}$. The combinatorial type of the link of an $s$-dimensional face of $T_{k,q}$ corresponds to the partition $(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_s)$ of $k$ into $s$ parts and further partitions of each $\lambda_i$. We introduce a new permutation statistic (the faithful initial part) and use it to describe the facets of the star cluster of a facet of $T_{k,q}$. Using a concrete shelling we show that the $i$-th entry of $h$-vector of the star cluster counts the number of permutations from $\mathbb{S}_k$ with exactly $i$ descents, taking into account the faithful initial part as the multiplicity. Finally, we describe a concrete shelling order for $T_{k,q}$, obtain a combinatorial interpretation and find a concrete formula for its $h$-vector.</description>

      <title>The Median of Sierpinski Triangle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The median $M$ of a graph $G$ is the set of vertices with a minimum total distance to all other vertices in the graph. In this paper, we determine the median of Sierpi\'{n}ski triangle graphs. Sierpi\'{n}ski triangle graphs, also known as Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket graphs of order $n$ are graphs formed by contracting all non-clique edges from the Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs of order ($n+1$).</description>

Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, and study their realization spaces and their closures. Specifically, we analyze their associated varieties and their irreducible decompositions. Additionally, we study a subfamily of nilpotent matroids, called weak nilpotent matroids, and compute a finite set of defining equations of their associated matroid varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A random set $S$ is $p$-spread if, for all sets $T$, $$\mathbb{P}(S \supseteq T) \leq p^{|T|}.$$ There is a constant $C&gt;1$ large enough that for every graph $G$ with maximum degree $D$, there is a $C/D$-spread distribution on $(D+1)$-colorings of $G$. Making use of a connection between thresholds and spread distributions due to Frankston, Kahn, Narayanan, and Park, a palette sparsification theorem of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna follows.</description>

      <title>Distribution of maxima and minima statistics on alternating permutations, Springer numbers, and avoidance of flat POPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find distributions of the left-to-right maxima, right-to-left maxima, left-to-right minima and right-to-left-minima statistics on up-down and down-up permutations of even and odd lengths. For instance, we show that the distribution of right-to-left maxima on up-down permutations of even length is given by $(\sec (t))^{q}$. We also derive the joint distribution of the maxima (resp., minima) statistics. To accomplish this, we generalize a result of Kitaev and Remmel by deriving joint distributions involving non-maxima (resp., non-minima) statistics. Consequently, we refine classic enumeration results of Andr\'e by introducing new $q$-analogues and $(p,q)$-analogues for the number of alternating permutations.
  Additionally, we verify Callan's conjecture (2012) that the number of up-down permutations of even length fixed by reverse and complement equals the Springer numbers, thereby offering another combinatorial interpretation of these numbers. Furthermore, we propose two $q$-analogues and a $(p,q)$-analogue of the Springer numbers. Lastly, we enumerate alternating permutations that avoid certain flat partially ordered patterns (POPs), where the only minimum or maximum elements are labeled by the largest or smallest numbers.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of dihypergraphs with specified degrees and edge types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dihypergraph consists of a set of vertices and a set of directed hyperedges, where each directed hyperedge is partitioned into a head and a tail. Directed hypergraphs are useful in many applications, including the study of chemical reactions or relational databases. We provide asymptotic formulae for the number of directed hypergraphs with given in-degree sequence, out-degree sequence, and the head and tail sizes of all directed hyperedges specified. Our formulae hold when none of the following parameters are too large: the maximum out-degree, the maximum in-degree, the maximum head size and the maximum tail size. If one of the four parameter sequences is near-regular, for example if each directed hyperedge has a tail of roughly the same size, then our formula is obtained using a simple argument based on existing asymptotic enumeration results for sparse bipartite graphs with given degree sequences. We also establish the same formula without the regularity assumption but with a larger relative error term, using a martingale argument.</description>

      <title>Blowups of triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A highly influential result of Nikiforov states that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ contains at least $\gamma n^h$ copies of a fixed $h$-vertex graph $H$, then $G$ contains a blowup of $H$ of order $\Omega_{\gamma,H}(\log n)$. While the dependence on $n$ is optimal, the correct dependence on $\gamma$ is unknown; all known proofs yield bounds that are polynomial in $\gamma$, but the best known upper bound, coming from random graphs, is only logarithmic in $\gamma$. It is a major open problem to narrow this gap.
  We prove that if $H$ is triangle-free, then the logarithmic behavior of the upper bound is the truth. That is, under the assumptions above, $G$ contains a blowup of $H$ of order $\Omega_H (\log n/{\log(1/\gamma)})$. This is the first non-trivial instance where the optimal dependence in Nikiforov's theorem is known.
  As a consequence, we also prove an upper bound on multicolor Ramsey numbers of blowups of triangle-free graphs, proving that the dependence on the number of colors is polynomial once the blowup is sufficiently large. This shows that, from the perspective of multicolor Ramsey numbers, blowups of fixed triangle-free graphs behave like bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>On z-coloring and ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring of graphs as improved variants of the b-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph and $c$ a proper vertex coloring of $G$. A vertex $u$ is called b-vertex in $(G,c)$ if all colors except $c(u)$ appear in the neighborhood of $u$. By a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring of $G$ using colors $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ we define a proper vertex coloring $c$ such that there is a b-vertex $u$ (called nice vertex) such that for each $j\in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ with $j\not=c(u)$, $u$ is adjacent to a b-vertex of color $j$. The ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-chromatic number of $G$ (denoted by ${\rm b}^{\ast}(G)$) is the largest integer $k$ such that $G$ has a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring using $k$ colors. Every graph $G$ admits a ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring which is an improvement over the famous b-coloring. A z-coloring of $G$ is a coloring $c$ using colors $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ containing a nice vertex of color $k$ such that for each two colors $i&lt;j$, each vertex of color $j$ has a neighbor of color $i$ in the graph (i.e. $c$ is obtained from a greedy coloring of $G$). We obtain results for ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring and z-coloring of block graphs, cacti, $P_4$-sparse graphs and graphs with girth greater than $4$. We prove that z-coloring and ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-coloring have a locality property. A linear 0-1 programming model is also presented for z-coloring of graphs. The positive results suggest that researches can be focused on ${\rm b}^{\ast}$-colorings (or z-colorings) instead of b-coloring of graphs.</description>

      <title>Stanley's conjecture on the Schur positivity of distributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we solve an open problem on distributive lattices, which was proposed by Stanley in 1998. This problem was motivated by a conjecture due to Griggs, which equivalently states that the incomparability graph of the boolean algebra $B_n$ is nice. Stanley introduced the idea of studying the nice property of a graph by investigating the Schur positivity of its corresponding chromatic symmetric functions. Since the boolean algebras form a special class of distributive lattices, Stanley raised the question of whether the incomparability graph of any distributive lattice is Schur positive. Stanley further noted that this seems quite unlikely. In this paper, we construct a family of distributive lattices which are not nice and hence not Schur positive. We also provide a family of distributive lattices which are nice but not Schur positive.</description>

      <title>Dynamically syndetic sets and the combinatorics of syndetic, idempotent filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset of the positive integers is \emph{dynamically central syndetic} if it contains the set of times that a point returns to a neighborhood of itself under a minimal transformation of a compact metric space. These sets are part of the highly-influential link between dynamics and combinatorics forged by Furstenberg and Weiss in the 1970's. Our main result is a characterization of dynamically central syndetic sets as precisely those sets that belong to syndetic, idempotent filters. Idempotent filters are combinatorial objects that abound in ergodic Ramsey theory but have been largely unnoticed and unexplored. We develop the algebra of these objects for the proof of the main theorem and with an eye toward future applications.
  The main result is best contextualized as a ``global'' analogue to Bergelson and Hindman's ``local'' characterization of Furstenberg's central sets as members of minimal, idempotent ultrafilters. It leads to a dual characterization of sets of topological pointwise recurrence, allowing us to answer a question of Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. We draw numerous striking contrasts between pointwise recurrence and set recurrence, a topic with a long history in the subject and its applications, and answer four questions posed by Host, Kra, and Maass. We also show that the intersection of a dynamically central syndetic set with a set of pointwise recurrence must be piecewise syndetic, generalizing results of Dong, Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye.</description>

      <title>A Row-wise Algorithm for Graph Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a $\{0,1\}$-matrix $M$, the graph realization problem for $M$ asks if there exists a spanning forest such that the columns of $M$ are incidence vectors of paths in the forest. The problem is closely related to the recognition of network matrices, which are a large subclass of totally unimodular matrices and have many applications in mixed-integer programming. Previously, Bixby and Wagner have designed an efficient algorithm for graph realization that grows a submatrix in a column-wise fashion whilst maintaining a graphic realization. This paper complements their work by providing an algorithm that works in a row-wise fashion and uses similar data structures. The main challenge in designing efficient algorithms for the graph realization problem is ambiguity as there may exist many graphs realizing $M$. The key insight for designing an efficient row-wise algorithm is that a graphic matrix is uniquely represented by an SPQR tree, a graph decomposition that stores all graphs with the same set of cycles. The developed row-wise algorithm uses data structures that are compatible with the column-wise algorithm and can be combined with the latter to detect maximal graphic submatrices.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of tiles in finite Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of periodic tiling (PT) property for finite abelian groups. A group has the PT property if any non-periodic set that tiles the group by translation has a periodic tiling complement. This property extends the scope beyond groups with the Haj\'os property. We classify all cyclic groups having the PT property. Additionally, we construct groups that possess the PT property but without the Haj\'os property. As byproduct, we identify new groups for which the implication ``Tile $\Longrightarrow$ Spectral" holds. For elementary $p$-groups having the PT property, we show that a tile must be a complete set of representatives of the cosets of some subgroup, by analyzing the structure of tiles.</description>

      <title>Encoding Semi-Directed Phylogenetic Networks with Quarnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks are graphs that are used to represent evolutionary relationships between different taxa. They generalize phylogenetic trees since for example, unlike trees, they permit lineages to combine. Recently, there has been rising interest in semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed graphs in which certain lineage combination events are represented by directed edges coming together, whereas the remaining edges are left undirected. One reason to consider such networks is that it can be difficult to root a network using real data. In this paper, we consider the problem of when a semi-directed phylogenetic network is defined or encoded by the smaller networks that it induces on the $4$-leaf subsets of its leaf set. These smaller networks are called quarnets. We prove that semi-directed binary level-$2$ phylogenetic networks are encoded by their quarnets, but that this is not the case for level-$3$. In addition, we prove that the so-called blob tree of a semi-directed binary network, a tree that gives the coarse-grained structure of the network, is always encoded by the quarnets of the network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of groups arising from context-free inverse graphs. We provide closure properties, prove that their co-word problems are context-free, study the torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous rational group. Furthermore, we use a generalized version of the free product of graphs and prove that such a product is context-free inverse closed. We also exhibit an example of a group in our class that is not residually finite and one that is not poly-context-free. These properties make them interesting candidates to disprove both the Lehnert conjecture (which characterizes co-context-free groups as all subgroups of Thompson's group V) and the Brough conjecture (which characterizes finitely generated poly-context-free groups as virtual finitely generated subgroups of direct products of free groups).</description>

      <title>Quantum Rainbow Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce rainbow codes, a novel class of quantum error correcting codes generalising colour codes and pin codes. Rainbow codes can be defined on any $D$-dimensional simplicial complex that admits a valid $(D+1)$-colouring of its $0$-simplices. We study in detail the case where these simplicial complexes are derived from chain complexes obtained via the hypergraph product and, by reinterpreting these codes as collections of colour codes joined at domain walls, show that we can obtain code families with growing distance and number of encoded qubits as well as logical non-Clifford gates implemented by transversal application of $T$ and $T^\dag$. By combining these techniques with the quasi-hyperbolic colour codes of Zhu et al. (arXiv:2310.16982) we obtain families of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates and parameters $[\![n,O(n),O(log(n))]\!]$ which allow the magic-state yield parameter $\gamma = \log_d(n/k)$ to be made arbitrarily small. In contrast to other recent constructions that achieve $\gamma \rightarrow 0$ our codes are natively defined on qubits, are LDPC, and have logical non-Clifford gates implementable by single-qubit (rather than entangling) physical operations, but are not asymptotically good.</description>

      <title>Dowker duality, profunctors, and spectral sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intent of this paper is to explore Dowker duality from a combinatorial, topological, and categorical perspective. The paper presents three short, new proofs of Dowker duality using various poset fiber lemmas. We introduce modifications of joins and products of simplicial complexes called relational join and relational product complexes. These relational complexes can be constructed whenever there is a relation between simplicial complexes, which includes the context of Dowker duality and covers of simplicial complexes. In this more general setting, we show that the homologies of the simplicial complexes and the relational complexes fit together in a long exact sequence. Similar results are then established for profunctors, which are generalizations of relations to categories. The cograph and graph of profunctors play the role of the relational join and relational product complexes. For a profunctor that arise from adjoint functors between $C$ and $D$, we show that $C$, $D$, the cograph, and the graph all have homotopy equivalent classifying spaces. Lastly, we show that given any profunctor from $D$ to $C$, the homologies of $C$, $D$, the cograph, and the graph form a long exact sequence. We make use of a spectral sequence for Grothendieck fibrations of small categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $[X,Y]$-edge colouring game is played with a set of $k$ colours on a graph $G$ with initially uncoloured edges by two players, Alice (A) and Bob (B). The players move alternately. Player $X\in\{A,B\}$ has the first move. $Y\in\{A,B,-\}$. If $Y\in\{A,B\}$, then only player $Y$ may skip any move, otherwise skipping is not allowed for any player. A move consists of colouring an uncoloured edge with one of the $k$ colours such that adjacent edges have distinct colours. When no more moves are possible, the game ends. If every edge is coloured in the end, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
  The $[X,Y]$-game chromatic index $\chi_{[X,Y]}'(G)$ is the smallest nonnegative integer $k$ such that Alice has a winning strategy for the $[X,Y]$-edge colouring game played on $G$ with $k$ colours. The graph $G$ is called line $[X,Y]$-perfect if, for any edge-induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, \[\chi_{[X,Y]}'(H)=\omega(L(H)),\] where $\omega(L(H))$ denotes the clique number of the line graph of $H$.
  For each of the six possibilities $(X,Y)\in\{A,B\}\times\{A,B,-\}$, we characterise line $[X,Y]$-perfect graphs by forbidden (edge-induced) subgraphs and by explicit structural descriptions, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the $nk-attack Roman Dominating Number of a Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the dominating number of a graph is the minimum size of a vertex set, $V' \subseteq V$, so that every vertex in the graph is either in $V'$ or is adjacent to a vertex in $V'$. A Roman Dominating function of $G$ is defined as $f:V \rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that every vertex with a label of 0 in $G$ is adjacent to a vertex with a label of 2. The Roman Dominating number of a graph is the minimum total weight over all possible Roman Dominating functions. We consider the $k$-attack Roman Domination, particularly focusing on 2-attack Roman Domination. A Roman Dominating function of $G$ is a $k$-attack Roman Dominating function of $G$ if for all $j\leq k$, any subset $S$ of $j$ vertices all with label 0 must have at least $j$ vertices with label 2 in the open neighborhood of $S$. The $k$-attack Roman Dominating number of $G, \gkaRD{G}$, is the minimum total weight over all possible $k$-attack Roman Dominating functions. We find $\gtaRD{G}$ for particular graph class, discuss properties of $k$-attack Roman Domination, and make several connections with other domination ideas.</description>

      <title>The binomial random graph is a bad inducer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite graph $F$ and a value $p \in [0,1]$, let $I(F,p)$ denote the largest $y$ for which there is a sequence of graphs of edge density approaching $p$ so that the induced $F$-density of the sequence approaches $y$. We show that for all $F$ on at least three vertices and all $p \in (0,1)$, the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ has induced $F$-density strictly less than $I(F,p).$ This provides a negative answer to a problem posed by Liu, Mubayi and Reiher.
  Our approach is in the limiting setting of graphons, and we in fact show a stronger result: the binomial random graph is never a \emph{local} maximum in the space of graphons of edge density $p$. This is done by finding a sequence of balanced perturbations of arbitrarily small norm that increase the $F$-density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the poset of biflats of a matroid $M$, a Lagrangian analog of the lattice of flats of $M$, and study the topology of its order complex, which we call the biflats complex. This work continues the study of the Lagrangian combinatorics of matroids, which was recently initiated by work of Ardila, Denham and Huh. We show the biflats complex contains two distinguished subcomplexes: the conormal complex of $M$ and the simplicial join of the Bergman complexes of $M$ and $M^\perp$, the matroidal dual of $M$. Our main theorems give sequences of elementary collapses of the biflats complex onto the conormal complex and the join of the Bergman complexes of $M$ and $M^\perp$. These collapses give a combinatorial proof that the biflats complex, conormal complex and the join of the Bergman complexes of $M$ and $M^\perp$ are all simple homotopy equivalent. Although simple homotopy equivalent, these complexes have many different combinatorial properties. We collect and prove a list of such properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize plane bipartite graphs whose resonance graphs are daisy cubes, and therefore generalize related results on resonance graphs of benzenoid graphs, catacondensed even ring systems, as well as 2-connected outerplane bipartite graphs. Firstly, we prove that if $G$ is a plane elementary bipartite graph other than $K_2$, then the resonance graph of $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if the Fries number of $G$ equals the number of finite faces of $G$. Next, we extend the above characterization from plane elementary bipartite graphs to plane bipartite graphs and show that the resonance graph of a plane bipartite graph $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if $G$ is weakly elementary bipartite such that each of its elementary component $G_i$ other than $K_2$ holds the property that the Fries number of $G_i$ equals the number of finite faces of $G_i$. Along the way, we provide a structural characterization for a plane elementary bipartite graph whose resonance graph is a daisy cube, and show that a Cartesian product graph is a daisy cube if and only if all of its nontrivial factors are daisy cubes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Werner Krandick's Binary Tree Jump Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twenty years ago, Werner Krandick defined two statistics on binary trees. The first one determines the number of jumps, when traversing the tree in depth-first-search, from a vertex to one closer to the root, and the second keeps tracks of the sum of the jump-distances. He used clever but ad hoc human-generated arguments to find explicit expressions for their expectations. In this methodological note, we illustrate the power of experimental mathematics and symbolic computation to do much more. We derive closed-form expressions for the actual weight-enumerators according to these statistics (from which not only the expectations, but also the variances, and as many higher moments as desired, can be obtained). We also actually give the first eight moments, and conjecture that the first statistic (number of jumps) is asymptotically normal, and prove that the second one (sum of jump distances) is definitely not. In this revised version we are happy to announce that Stephen Melczer and Tia Ruza fully proved the asymptotic normality, and we provide a link to their writeup.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on isolation of graphs dominated by a vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A copy of a graph $F$ is called an $F$-copy. For any graph $G$, the $F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest subset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$ of $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$ (equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\iota(G,K_1)$ is the domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge domination number of $G$. We prove that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\gamma(F) = 1$ (that is, $F$ has a vertex that is adjacent to all the other vertices of $F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\iota(G,F) \leq \big\lfloor \frac{m+1}{k+2} \big\rfloor$ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and $G$ is a $6$-cycle. This was recently posed as a conjecture by Zhang and Wu, who settled the case where $F$ is a star. The result for the case where $F$ is a clique had been obtained by Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author. The bound is attainable for any $m \geq 0$ unless $1 \leq m = k \leq 2$. New ideas, including divisibility considerations, are introduced in the proof of the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalise several recent results by Archer and Geary on descents in powers of permutations, and confirm all their conjectures. Specifically, for all $k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, we prove explicit formulas for the expected numbers of descents and inversions in the $k$-th powers of permutations in $\mathcal{S}_n$ for all $n\geq2k+1$. We also compute the number of Grassmanian permutations in $\mathcal{S}_n$ whose $k$-th powers remain Grassmanian, and the number of permutations in $\mathcal{S}_n$ whose $k$-th powers have the maximum number of descents.</description>

      <title>Congruence Classes of Simplex Structures in Finite Field Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem over finite fields. For a graph $G$, two embeddings $p, p': V(G) \to \mathbb{F}_q^d$ of a graph $G$ are congruent if for all edges $(v_i, v_j)$ of $G$ we have that $||p(v_i) - p(v_j)|| = ||p'(v_i) - p'(v_j)||$. What is the infimum of $s$ such that for any subset $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| \gtrsim q^s$, $E$ contains a positive proportion of congruence classes of $G$ in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$? Bennett et al. and McDonald used group action methods to prove results in the case of $k$-simplices. The work of Iosevich, Jardine, and McDonald as well as that of Bright et al. have proved results in the case of trees and trees of simplices, utilizing the inductive nature of these graphs.
  Recently, Aksoy, Iosevich, and McDonald combined these two approaches to obtain nontrivial bounds on the "bowtie" graph, two triangles joined at a vertex. Their proof relies on an application of the Hadamard three-lines theorem to pass to a different graph. We develop novel geometric techniques called branch shifting and simplex unbalancing to reduce our analysis of trees of simplices to a much smaller class of simplex structures. This allows us to establish a framework that handles a wide class of graphs exhibiting a combination of rigid and loose behavior. In $\mathbb{F}_q^2$, this approach gives new nontrivial bounds on chains and trees of simplices. In $\mathbb{F}_q^d$, we improve on the results of Bright et al. in many cases and generalize their work to a wider class of simplex trees. We discuss partial progress on how this framework can be extended to more general simplex structures, such as cycles of simplices and structures of simplices glued together along an edge or a face.</description>

Abstract: In 1750, Gabriel Cramer famously stated, without proof, his eponymous rule for solving a system of linear equations with as many equations as unknowns. We give a purely combinatorial, and purely self-contained, proof of this old chestnut, still useful after all these years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the bodyguard problem for graphs. This is a variation of Surrounding Cops and Robber but, in this model, a smallest possible group of bodyguards must surround the president and then maintain this protection indefinitely. We investigate some elementary bounds, then solve this problem for the infinite graph families of complete graphs, wheels, trees, cycles, complete multipartite graphs, and two-dimensional grids. We also examine the problem in more general Cartesian, strong, and lexicographic products.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solutions of linear differential equations: an arithmetic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a linear differential equation with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(x)$, an important question is to know whether its full space of solutions consists of algebraic functions, or at least if one of its specific solutions is algebraic. After presenting motivating examples coming from various branches of mathematics, we advertise in an elementary way a beautiful local-global arithmetic approach to these questions, initiated by Grothendieck in the late sixties. This approach has deep ramifications and leads to the still unsolved Grothendieck-Katz $p$-curvature conjecture.</description>

      <title>Everything is possible: constructing spectrahedra with prescribed facial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any finite set of nonnegative integers, there exists a closed convex set whose facial dimension signature coincides with this set of integers, that is, the dimensions of its nonempty faces comprise exactly this set of integers. In this work, we show that such sets can be realised as solution sets of systems of finitely many convex quadratic inequalities, and hence are representable via second-order cone programming problems, and are, in particular, spectrahedral. It also follows that these sets are facially exposed, in contrast to earlier constructions. We obtain a lower bound on the minimum number of convex quadratic inequalities needed to represent a closed convex set with prescribed facial dimension signature, and show that our bound is tight for some special cases. Finally, we relate the question of finding efficient representations with indecomposability of integer sequences and other topics, and discuss a substantial number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Graph Search Trees and the Intermezzo Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The last in-tree recognition problem asks whether a given spanning tree can be derived by connecting each vertex with its rightmost left neighbor of some search ordering. In this study, we demonstrate that the last-in-tree recognition problem for Generic Search is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. We utilize this finding to strengthen a complexity result from order theory. Given a partial order $\pi$ and a set of triples, the $\mathsf{NP}$-complete intermezzo problem asks for a linear extension of $\pi$ where each first element of a triple is not between the other two. We show that this problem remains $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even when the Hasse diagram of the partial order forms a tree of bounded height. In contrast, we give an $\mathsf{XP}$-algorithm for the problem when parameterized by the width of the partial order. Furthermore, we show that $\unicode{x2013}$ under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis $\unicode{x2013}$ the running time of this algorithm is asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of decision trees for percolation inequalities started with the celebrated O'Donnell--Saks--Schramm--Servedio (OSSS) inequality. We prove decision tree generalizations of the Harris--Kleitman (HK), van den Berg--Kesten (vdBK), and other inequalities. These inequalities are then applied to estimate the connection probabilities in Bernoulli bond percolation on general graphs.</description>

      <title>On the maximum size of ultrametric orthogonal sets over discrete valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a discrete valued field with finite residue field. In analogy with orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a well-studied notion of "ultrametric orthogonality" in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, motivated by a question of Erd{\H{o}}s in the real case, given integers $k \geq \ell \geq 2$, we investigate the maximum size of a subset $S \subseteq \mathcal{K}^n \setminus\{{\bf 0}\}$ satisfying the following property: for any $E \subseteq S$ of size $k$, there exists $F \subseteq E$ of size $\ell$ such that any two distinct vectors in $F$ are orthogonal. Other variants of this property are also studied.</description>
