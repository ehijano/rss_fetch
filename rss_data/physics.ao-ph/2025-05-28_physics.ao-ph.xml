      <title>Align-DA: Align Score-based Atmospheric Data Assimilation with Multiple Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) aims to estimate the full state of a dynamical system by combining partial and noisy observations with a prior model forecast, commonly referred to as the background. In atmospheric applications, this problem is fundamentally ill-posed due to the sparsity of observations relative to the high-dimensional state space. Traditional methods address this challenge by simplifying background priors to regularize the solution, which are empirical and require continual tuning for application. Inspired by alignment techniques in text-to-image diffusion models, we propose Align-DA, which formulates DA as a generative process and uses reward signals to guide background priors, replacing manual tuning with data-driven alignment. Specifically, we train a score-based model in the latent space to approximate the background-conditioned prior, and align it using three complementary reward signals for DA: (1) assimilation accuracy, (2) forecast skill initialized from the assimilated state, and (3) physical adherence of the analysis fields. Experiments with multiple reward signals demonstrate consistent improvements in analysis quality across different evaluation metrics and observation-guidance strategies. These results show that preference alignment, implemented as a soft constraint, can automatically adapt complex background priors tailored to DA, offering a promising new direction for advancing the field.</description>

      <title>Post-processing of wind gusts from COSMO-REA6 with a spatial Bayesian hierarchical extreme value model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to provide a probabilistic gust analysis for the region of Germany that is calibrated with station observations and with an interpolation to unobserved locations. To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability and Dynamics of Supersonic Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of shear layer instability in compressible flows is key to understanding phenomena from aerodynamics to astrophysical jets. Blumen's seminal paper [``Shear layer instability of an inviscid compressible fluid," J. Fluid Mech. {\bf 40}, 769--781 (1970)] established a linear stability framework for inviscid compressible shear flows, emphasizing velocity gradients and compressibility effects. However, the nonlinear regime remains insufficiently explored. This research extends Blumen's framework by conducting a weakly nonlinear stability analysis using the method of multiple scales to derive amplitude equations, such as the Landau-Stuart and complex Landau equations. Perturbation variables are expanded in a power series to capture amplitude evolution beyond linear theory. Finite boundary conditions are incorporated to enhance physical applicability. The study analyzes how compressibility and Mach number influence nonlinear saturation, revealing Mach-dependent bifurcations in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) with alternating stable and unstable regimes. Phase portraits and trajectories illustrate transitions, saturation, and spiral decay, which are relevant to astrophysical shear flows. Bifurcation analysis reveals both supercritical and subcritical Hopf behavior in compressible shear flows, underscoring the importance of nonlinear effects in the onset and evolution of flow instabilities. Qualitative and quantitative results of instability evolution have been shown from nonlinear stability analysis. This work bridges the critical gap between linear and fully nonlinear stability analyses by offering a systematic weakly nonlinear framework and the nonlinear dynamics for compressible shear layers. It generalizes the earlier linear results and provides new predictions about bifurcation behavior and long-time state selection in compressible flows.</description>
