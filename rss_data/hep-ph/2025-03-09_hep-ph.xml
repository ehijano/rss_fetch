      <title>A New Source for (QCD) Axion Dark Matter Production: Curvature-Induced</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a novel mechanism for generating dark matter from a fast-rolling scalar field, relevant for both inflation and rotating axion models, and apply it specifically to the (QCD) axion. Dark matter comes from scalar field fluctuations generated by the product of the curvature perturbation and the fast-rolling background field. These fluctuations can explain the totality of dark matter in a vast axion parameter space, particularly for the QCD axion, which will be targeted by upcoming experiments. We review the constraints on this mechanism and potential gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>An improved evaluation of the electroweak contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise evaluation of the electroweak contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon requires control over all aspects of the Standard Model, ranging from Higgs physics, over multi-loop computations for bosonic and (heavy-)fermion diagrams, to non-perturbative effects in the presence of light quarks. Currently, the dominant uncertainties arise from such hadronic effects in the vector-vector-axial-vector three-point function, an improved understanding of which has recently emerged in the context of hadronic light-by-light scattering. Profiting from these developments as well as new perturbative and non-perturbative input for the charm contribution, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{EW}=154.4(4)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Misalignment Mechanism for Axion Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rotation in the field space of a complex scalar field corresponds to a Bose-Einstein condensation of $U(1)$ charges. We point out that fluctuations in this rotating condensate exhibit sound-wave modes, which can be excited by cosmic perturbations and identified with axion fluctuations once the $U(1)$ charge condensate has been sufficiently diluted by cosmic expansion. We consider the possibility that these axion fluctuations constitute dark matter and develop a formalism to compute its abundance. We carefully account for the growth of fluctuations during the epoch where the complex scalar field rotates on the body of the potential and possible nonlinear evolution when the fluctuations become non-relativistic. We find that the resultant dark matter abundance can exceed the conventional and kinetic misalignment contributions if the radial direction of the complex scalar field is sufficiently heavy. The axion dark matter may also be warm enough to leave imprints on structure formation. We discuss the implications of this novel dark matter production mechanism -- {\it acoustic misalignment mechanism} -- for the axion rotation cosmology, including kination domination and baryogenesis from axion rotation, as well as for axion searches.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Oscillating scalar potential and its implications for cosmic neutrino background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism in which an external oscillatory wave modulates the mass-squared term of a scalar potential, periodically switching its sign. As a result of this "potential oscillation," the vacuum transitions between symmetry-broken and symmetry-restored phases. This repeated toggling leads to a time-varying vacuum state with rich phenomenological consequences, driven by the scalar field's couplings to other sectors. As a concrete illustration, we demonstrate how these oscillations can open a new avenue for probing the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>The bound and resonant states of $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ with the complex scaling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the possible molecular states composed of a pair of heavy mesons such as $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$, $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ in the framework of the one-boson-exchange model. The exchanged bosons include the pseudoscalar, scalar and vector mesons($\pi$, $\sigma$, $\rho$, $\omega$). We use the Bonn approximation to get the interaction potential of one-boson-exchange model, then apply the complex scaling method to calculate the bound and resonant states. The results indicate that the $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ system can not only form several bound states, but also a P-wave resonant state. The hadron molecular state model can explain the structure of $T_{cc}^+$ as a bound state $DD^{*}$ with quantum number $I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$. In addition, we also discovered other bound and resonant states, which have the potential to be observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Testing classicality of gravity by gravitation decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we discuss an influence of an external weak gravitational field on the gravitational self-decoherence effect with help of the stochastic extension of regularized Shr\"odinger-Newton equation in a curved background. We derive the master equation and demonstrate that it leads to the experimentally verifiable conclusions about applicability of the classical description of the weak gravitation field. Namely, a presence of oscillating terms in the otherwise purely exponential decay of the coherence would indicate classicality of gravity for the case.</description>

      <title>Are compact open-charm tetraquarks consistent with recent lattice results?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the hypothesis that positive-parity charm meson resonances exhibit a compact tetraquark structure has some clear tension with recent lattice results for the $S$-wave $\pi D$ system for an SU(3) flavor symmetric setting. In particular, we show that such a diquark--anti-diquark tetraquark scenario would call for the presence of a state in the flavor $[{\mathbf{\overline{15}}}]$ representation, not seen in the lattice analysis. Moreover, we show that analogous lattice data in the axial-vector channel are even more sensitive to the internal structure of these very interesting states.</description>

      <title>Realize cosmological inflation in supersymmetric Grand Unified models with $R$-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a discussion for cosmological inflation based on a general renormalizable supersymmetric model which can be naturally embedded into grand unified models. Successful hybrid inflation has been realized with an effective Mexican-hat potential, while avoiding the generation of extra massless multiplets so that gauge coupling unification is maintained in the supersymmetric grand unified models. This is achieved by including $R$-symmetry violating couplings. A relatively large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\approx 0.03$ and a spectral index $n_s\approx 0.965$ are obtained, which are expected to be further tested by future experiments. Futhermore, The hierarchy of parameters in the model can be solved at the same time, and all dimensionless parameters are in the range from 0.3 to 3 by adjustment of $R$-charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study optimizes resonance parameters responsible for strangeness production in the SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) transport model using a genetic algorithm. By fitting resonance parameters to experimental data on exclusive strangeness cross-sections at low energies, we significantly improve the model's accuracy, especially in pion-proton interactions. Our approach explores how machine learning tools can be used for precise resonance tuning in transport approaches.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the hadronization of parton showers using the HOMER method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the HOMER method, a technique to solve a restricted version of the inverse problem of hadronization -- extracting the Lund string fragmentation function $f(z)$ from data using only observable information. Here, we demonstrate its utility by extracting $f(z)$ from synthetic Pythia simulations using high-level observables constructed on an event-by-event basis, such as multiplicities and shape variables. Four cases of increasing complexity are considered, corresponding to $e^+e^-$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $90$ GeV producing either a string stretched between a $q$ and $\bar{q}$ containing no gluons; the same string containing one gluon $g$ with fixed kinematics; the same but the gluon has varying kinematics; and the most realistic case, strings with an unrestricted number of gluons that is the end-result of a parton shower. We demonstrate the extraction of $f(z)$ in each case, with the result of only a relatively modest degradation in performance of the HOMER method with the increased complexity of the string system.</description>

      <title>Modular Fluctuations in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verlinde and Zurek (VZ) have proposed that quantum gravity fluctuations in causal diamonds lead to observable effects. In particular, they argued that in quantum gravity causal diamonds have an uncertainty in their size that scales as $\delta L \sim \sqrt{\ell_p L}$, i.e. fluctuations are enhanced from the Planck scale. In this work, we explore the origin of the VZ scaling by studying scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmology. We reinterpret these cosmological perturbations as fluctuations of the modular Hamiltonian associated with a causal diamond, establishing a connection between modular fluctuations and observable primordial perturbations. Independent of assumptions about the modular Hamiltonian or the background spacetime, our results show that -- whenever an (effective) spherically symmetric perturbation is quantized -- it leads to the VZ scaling. However, whether such a mode exists in the vacuum of any theory of quantum gravity remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Mott transitions, quantum criticality, and finite-temperature effects in tunable Dirac materials from functional renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark-sector effects using gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations are a powerful tool to constrain fundamental physics. This work considers dark matter that carries charge under a dark abelian massive vector field. If such dark matter is bound inside coalescing neutron stars, the presence of the new force will modify the total energy of the binary, and the emission of dark radiation modes will impact the rate of inspiral. At leading order, the dark matter corrections introduce a Yukawa term to the potential energy and a dipole radiation mode. We calculate modifications to the binary inspiral waveform to first post-Newtonian order, incorporate these corrections into a state-of-the-art waveform model for neutron star binaries, and use this model in a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis on real data collected by current, second-generation ground-based detectors. Through this study, we place the first robust constraints on the Yukawa interaction strength and dipole emission parameter. We find that the strongest constraints are obtained from analysis of the GW170817 event, for which the Yukawa interaction strength is constrained to be less than $O(10^{-2})$ and the dipole emission parameter is less than $O(10^{-4})$ at 90% credibility.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to offer significant advantages over classical computing, making it a promising avenue for exploring alternative methods in High Energy Physics (HEP) simulations. This work presents the implementation of a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (qGAN) to simultaneously generate gluon-initiated jet images for both ECAL and HCAL detector channels, a task crucial for high-energy physics simulations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The results demonstrate high fidelity in replicating energy deposit patterns and preserving the implicit training data features. This study marks the first step toward generating multi-channel pictures and quark-initiated jet images using quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Bridging between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an idea to build a bridge between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation by backtracking the evolution of the inflaton field from the present time to the end of reheating. This idea is implemented when the potential gradient is negligible compared to the Hubble friction, rendering the inflaton field frozen, till the present time. We find a simple analytic relation between the reheating temperature and the observational parameters for dark energy, and numerically confirm its validity for typical models of quintessential inflation. This relation is universal and can apply to all quintessential inflation models with any reheating mechanism. It also implies that any quintessential inflation model with a successful reheating with the reheating temperature $1\textrm{MeV}\lesssim T_\textrm{re}\lesssim 10^{15}\textrm{GeV}$ predicts the equation of state of dark energy today extremely close to $-1$, i.e. $-1+10^{-60}\lesssim w_0\lesssim -1+10^{-24}$, unless the inflaton field unfreezes before the present time.</description>

      <title>"Glueballs" in the Quantum Mechanics of three large massless Yang-Mills coupled Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a loop truncated Jevicki-Sakita effective collective field Hamiltonian to obtain, over a very large range of values of 't Hooft's coupling, and directly in the large N limit, the large N (planar) ground state energy, the planar ground state expectation values of invariant correlators, and the 1/N spectrum of the quantum mechanical system of three massless Yang-Mills coupled matrices. This captures the dynamics of the (residual) gauge invariant sector of the spatially reduced 3+1 dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory, in the large N limit. The large N loop space constraints are handled by the use of master variables. As is the case for two matrices, the method is highly efficient directly in the massless limit, and it reproduces to a very high precision the scaling dependence of physical quantities, determined by their dimensions, on the dimensionful 't Hooft coupling. We obtain the bound state masses of "glueballs", their quantum numbers and ensuing degeneracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been impressive progress in quark flavour physics, with current efforts tackling complicated quantities such as for example inclusive decays, decays to QCD-unstable final states and radiative decays. At the same time current lattice flavour physics results are receiving a lot of attention from outside the lattice community. This requires careful scrutiny, even for well explored quantities. In this plenary contribution I review the status of flavour physics observables and, in the context of heavy flavours, suggest possible benchmark quantities that could allow to better compare intermediate results. These can in turn be used to investigate the origin of existing (and possible future) tensions.</description>

      <title>Search for primordial black holes from gravitational wave populations using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) signals detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration might be sourced (partly) by the merges of primordial black holes (PBHs). The conventional hierarchical Bayesian inference methods can allow us to study population properties of GW events to search for the hints for PBHs. However, hierarchical Bayesian analysis require an analytic population model, and becomes increasingly computationally expensive as the number of sources grows. In this paper, we present a novel population analysis method based on deep learning, which enables the direct and efficient estimation of PBH population hyperparameters, such as the PBH fraction in dark matter, $f_{\rm PBH}$. Our approach leverages neural posterior estimation combined with conditional normalizing flows and two embedding networks. Our results demonstrate that inference can be performed within seconds, highlighting the promise of deep learning as a powerful tool for population inference with an increasing number of GW signals for next-generation detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic expansion schemes in functional approaches require the inclusion of higher order vertices. These vertices are expanded in independent tensor bases with a rapidly increasing number of basis elements. Amongst the related tasks are the construction of bases and projection operators, the importance ordering of their elements, and the optimisation of such tensor bases, as well as an analysis of their regularity in momentum space. We present progress in all these directions and introduce the Mathematica package TensorBases designed for the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Scientific Metrics in High Energy, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics in Latin America</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of key scientific metrics to evaluate the productivity and impact of research conducted in Latin American countries within the fields of High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (HECAP). Using data from the widely used open-access digital library INSPIRE-HEP, we provide a detailed assessment of the scientific contributions from the continent over the past 70 years. We provide data for the evolution of the overall productivity in the region relative to the rest of the world, comparing the productivity of each country, number of active researchers, number of publications, citations, h-index in total and relative to the population and number of researchers, as well as the productivity and impact compared to the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) invested in research, and the Human Development Index (HDI) of each country. We also analyse collaborations among the different countries, as well as collaborations with the rest of the world. Additionally, we studied the gender gap evolution over the same period. This pioneering analysis, which relies solely on open data, can serve as an essential resource for researchers and policymakers alike. It aims to empower scientists with insights into the significance of their contributions to both regional and global research. Moreover, it provides both researchers and policymakers with critical quantitative data, strengthening their understanding of the progress in scientific productivity over the years to better support scientific endeavours in Latin America.</description>

      <title>Reionization and the Hubble Constant: Correlations in the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has found early galaxies producing photons from more efficient ionization than previously assumed. This may suggest a reionization process with a larger reionization optical depth, $\tau_{\rm reio}$, in some mild disagreement with that inferred from measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Intriguingly, the CMB would prefer larger values of $\tau_{\rm reio}$, more consistent with the recent JWST hint, if the large-scale measurements (i.e. $\ell &lt;30$) of E-mode polarization are removed. In addition, $\tau_{\rm reio}$ has an indirect correlation with today's Hubble constant $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Motivated by these interesting observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-$\ell$ polarization data as a proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$. We further explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and late universe measurements of $H_0$, in $\Lambda$CDM as well as two proposals to alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy (EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for almost all cases due to the larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and its positive correlation with $H_0$, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.08349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dai and Pennington have performed a comprehensive analysis of essentially all pion and kaon pair production data from two-photon collisions below 1.5 GeV, including all high statistics results from Belle, as well as the older data from Mark II at SLAC, CELLO at DESY, and Crystal Ball at SLAC. Imposing the basic constraints required by analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry and making use of Low's low-energy theorem for QED, they were able to extract the final-state, strong-interaction scattering amplitudes for the intermediate $\pi \pi \to \pi \pi$ and $\pi \pi \to K \overline{K}$ reactions in a model-independent fashion. In addition, they provided good fits to the respective $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections that are known in the low-energy sector in the restricted angular range, $| \cos \theta | &lt; 0.6 - 0.8$. Using the parameters obtained in this fashion, these authors constructed the $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections integrated over the full angular range. In the present work, we use a version of chiral perturbation theory developed by Oller and Oset to evaluate the final-state, strong-interaction amplitudes theoretically, and we compare our low-energy QCD-based results with the amplitudes extracted by Dai and Pennington. We also calculate the $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections (integrated over the full angular range) and compare them with those obtained by Dai and Pennington. These calculations give a more detailed insight into the fit of chiral perturbation theory, not just to the measured $\gamma \gamma \to \pi \pi$ cross-sections, as is usually presented, but rather to a higher level of detail through the available analysis of the experimental data for the underlying final-state, strong-interaction, meson-meson scattering amplitudes $\pi \pi \to \pi \pi$ and $\pi \pi \to K \overline{K}$ themselves. The fits appear to be sensible.</description>

      <title>Combining Evolutionary Strategies and Novelty Detection to go Beyond the Alignment Limit of the $Z_3$ 3HDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel Artificial Intelligence approach for Beyond the Standard Model parameter space scans by augmenting an Evolutionary Strategy with Novelty Detection. Our approach leverages the power of Evolutionary Strategies, previously shown to quickly converge to the valid regions of the parameter space, with a \emph{novelty reward} to continue exploration once converged. Taking the $Z_3$ 3HDM as our Physics case, we show how our methodology allows us to quickly explore highly constrained multidimensional parameter spaces, providing up to eight orders of magnitude higher sampling efficiency when compared with pure random sampling and up to four orders of magnitude when compared to random sampling around the alignment limit. In turn, this enables us to explore regions of the parameter space that have been hitherto overlooked, leading to the possibility of novel phenomenological realisations of the $Z_3$ 3HDM that had not been considered before.</description>

Abstract: The prospected sensitivity in $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$ determination using an event shape observable, ratio of energy correlators at future electron-positron colliders is presented. The study focuses on the collinear region which has suffered from large theoretical and hadronization uncertainty in the past. The ratio effectively reduces the impacts of the uncertainties. With the amount of data that future electron-positron colliders could produce in 1 minute (40 $\text{pb}^{-1}$), a 1--2\% precision of $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$ could be reached depending on the hadronization uncertainty considered.</description>

Abstract: The Born-Oppenheimer potentials for QCD with light quarks include adjoint-hadron potentials that are repulsive at short distances and heavy-hadron-pair potentials that approach thresholds at large distances. The adjoint-hadron potentials must connect smoothly to the heavy-hadron-pair potentials at intermediate distances. We identify exotic hidden-heavy hadrons as bound states and resonances in adjoint-hadron potentials that cross below a heavy-hadron-pair threshold before approaching it. This explains why many exotic hidden-charm and hidden-bottom hadrons have energies near heavy-hadron-pair thresholds. The remarkable properties of some exotic hidden-heavy mesons can be explained by fine tunings of adjoint-meson energies in QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wash-in leptogenesis is an attractive mechanism to produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. It treats right-handed-neutrino interactions as spectator processes, on the same footing as electroweak sphalerons, that reprocess primordial charge asymmetries in the thermal plasma into a baryon-minus-lepton asymmetry. The origin of these primordial charges must be accounted for by new $CP$-violating dynamics at very high energies. In this paper, we propose such a scenario of chargegenesis that, unlike earlier proposals, primarily relies on new interactions in the gravitational sector. We point out that a coupling of a conserved current to the divergence of the Ricci scalar during reheating can lead to nonzero effective chemical potentials in the plasma that, together with a suitable charge-violating interaction, can result in the production of a primordial charge asymmetry. Gravitational chargegenesis represents a substantial generalization of the idea of gravitational baryogenesis. We provide a detailed analysis of a generic and minimal realization that is consistent with inflation and show that it can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analytical solution of the Dirac equation in a generalized tanh-shape hyperbolic potential, which allows us to unify various well-known quantum potentials under a single theoretical framework. This versatile potential model is used to compute the mass spectra for charmonium and bottomonium, with excellent agreement with experimental measurements and does better than some potential models in predicting the several orbital states. Our results not only validate the GTHP as a powerful tool for describing heavy quarkonium systems but also suggest its broader applicability in exploring quantum systems where similar potentials are effective. This work is a stepping stone for new research into fermionic systems with complex interactions, by jointly providing insights into foundational aspects of quantum mechanics as well as applications in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of compact stars as hideouts for color-spin-locked (CSL) quark matter (QM) is investigated in both MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Within the framework of NJL model, the idea of absolutely stable quark matter and the existence of conventional pure quark star (QS) are not supported; in addition, there appears to be no stable hybrid configuration above $2M_\odot$ as the hideout for CSL QM. The stable configurations of massive strange quark stars could be reproduced in the MIT bag model with QCD corrections being taken into account; moreover, they could act as the hiding place for the CSL QM. An interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic (EM) superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the quark core with a critical strength, while in some special cases a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. The analysis on energetics and time scale suggests that this process could act as an inducement mechanism to power typical fast radio bursts, but as a single source of energy, it is unlikely to generate other EM emissions such as gamma-ray bursts and giant flares.</description>

      <title>Doubling down on down-type diquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective field theory-based searches for new physics at colliders are relatively insensitive to interactions involving only right-handed down-type quarks. These interactions can hide amongst jet backgrounds at the LHC, and their indirect effects in electroweak and Higgs processes are small. Identifying scenarios in which these interactions dominate, we can naturally pick out just two tree-level mediators, both scalar diquarks. Over the full parameter space of these states, we analyse exotics searches at current and future hadron colliders, Higgs signal strength constraints, and indirect constraints from flavour physics, finding genuine complementarity between the data sets. In particular, while flavour constraints can exclude diquarks in the hundreds of TeV mass range, these can be evaded once a flavour structure is imposed on the couplings, as we illustrate by embedding the diquarks within a composite Higgs model. In combination, however, we show that flavour and collider constraints exclude down-type diquarks to multi-TeV scales, thus narrowing the remaining hiding places for new interactions amongst LHC data.</description>

Abstract: We present a study on the possibility of observing a hypothetical particle known as the Flavon $H_F$, which is predicted in an extension of the standard model that includes the so-called Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. The proposed decay channel is through a $b\bar{b}h$ final state, where the Higgs boson $(h)$ decays to a pair of photons or a pair of $b$ quarks $(h\to \gamma\gamma,\,b\bar{b})$. We found that, under special scenarios of the model parameter space, the processes analyzed could provide evidence for the existence of the Flavon in the next stage of the LHC: the High Luminosity LHC. Specifically, we predict a \textit{signal significance} of $5\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) in the $h\to b\bar{b}$ ($h\to\gamma\gamma$) channel for a Flavon mass of $800$ ($900$) GeV and an integrated luminosity of $2500$ ($3000$) fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the hidden-charm pentaquark predictions and discriminating the $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ spins through the effective range expansion</title>

Abstract: The Weinberg compositeness criterion dictates that a pure shallow bound state is characterized by a large scattering length $a_0\gg\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$ and a positive effective range $r_0$ that naturally scales to the size of $\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$, where $1/\beta$ signifies the interaction range. In constructing the contact-range effective field theory (EFT) up to the next-to-leading order to describe the pentaquarks $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ observed by the LHCb collaboration in 2019, we match the effective range $r_0$ at single-channel situation for these pentaquarks with the low-energy couplings within the EFT framework. Three different schemes are used to connect the couplings with the effective range. We find positive effective ranges $r_0$ of the natural size of $\mathcal{O}(1/\beta)$ for the spin configurations $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ for $P_c(4440)$ and $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ for $P_c(4457)$ within the molecular $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ description. Additionally, predictions from the power counting for low-energy couplings or Wilsonian coefficients suggest that, under heavy quark spin symmetry, the broad $P_c(4380)$ resonance, discovered by the LHCb collaboration in 2015, when considered as part of the single-channel $\bar{D}^{(*)} \Sigma_c^{(*)}$ molecular system alongside $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$, has a mass of approximately $4376$ $\rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>The Neutrino Mass Bound from Leptogenesis Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a great improvement in the computation of $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating equilibration rates for leptogenesis. These are relevant for the relativistic regime of the sterile Majorana fermions and the dynamics of the Standard Model particles acting as spectator processes. In order to probe the regime of large $({\cal O}(10^2))$ washout parameters, we add $\Delta L = 2$ washout processes, which we derive in the CTP-formalism. To demonstrate their significance, we apply state-of-the-art computational techniques to a simple yet well-motivated phenomenological scenario: unflavored leptogenesis in a hierarchical type-I seesaw model. We then perform a parameter scan of the final baryon asymmetry and find a constraint $m_\text{lightest} \lesssim 0.15 \, \text{eV}$ on the absolute neutrino mass scale, which is slightly less stringent than previously reported bounds obtained without the aforementioned improvements. The relaxation of the bounds is mainly due to partially equilibrated spectator fields, which protect part of the asymmetry from washout and lead to larger final asymmetries. While this might seem like a minor correction, the actual dynamics of the fields is substantially altered by these effects. Even though we focused on a particularly simple scenario for leptogenesis, the methods employed here can and should be extended to other models, thus giving us a more accurate picture of the different leptogenesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>ALPs coupled to gluons in the GeV mass range -- data-driven and consistent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new, fully consistent framework for describing GeV-scale axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to gluons. Unlike previous approaches, which either rely on pure chiral perturbation theory or introduce scheme-dependent parameters, our treatment simultaneously (i) enforces invariance under unphysical chiral rotations used to remove the ALP-gluon coupling, and (ii) incorporates heavier resonances relevant at the GeV scale. This construction enables robust matching between exclusive and perturbative descriptions of ALP decays, and reveals that commonly used descriptions can underestimate or overestimate ALP decay widths and production rates by orders of magnitude. We further show that the production of ALPs at proton accelerator experiments can incur large theoretical uncertainties, significantly impacting ALP event yields at past and future Lifetime Frontier experiments.</description>

Abstract: It was recently proposed (arxiv:2502.08887) that the time crystal Lagrangian introduced by Shapere and Wilczek in 2012 could be a model of dark energy. I point out that the model has an instability that drives its energy density to negative values, which may render it unsuitable as a model of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalization group restrictions on the standard model and the fourth chiral family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9808396</link>
      <description>arXiv:hep-ph/9808396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the two-loop renormalization group, the global profile of the Standard Model (SM) in its full parameter space is investigated up to the scale of the gauge singularity. The critical Higgs masses bordering the strong coupling, unstable and the safe regions are explicitly found. Restrictions on the Higgs boson mass as a function of a cutoff scale are obtained from the stability of the electroweak vacuum and from the absence of the strong coupling both in the Higgs and Yukawa sectors. The cutoff being equal to the Plank scale requires the Higgs mass to be M=(161.3+-20.6)+4-10 GeV and M&gt;=140.7+-10 GeV, where the M corridor is the theoretical one and the errors are due to the top mass uncertainty.
  The SM two-loop beta-functions are generalized to the massive neutrino case. Modification of the two-loop global profile of the SM extended by one new chiral family is studied, and bounds on the masses of the family are found. The requirement of self-consistency of the perturbative SM as an underlying theory up to the Planck or GUT scale excludes the fourth chiral family with the mass up to 250 GeV depending on the Higgs mass and the cutoff scale. Under precision experiment restriction M&lt;=200 GeV, the fourth chiral family, taken alone, is excluded. Nevertheless a pair of the chiral families constituting the vector-like one could still exist.</description>

      <title>Microlensing signatures of extended dark objects using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based method for the detection of the unique gravitational microlensing signatures of extended dark objects, such as boson stars, axion miniclusters and subhalos. We adapt MicroLIA, a machine learning-based package tailored to handle the challenges posed by low-cadence data in microlensing surveys. Using realistic observational timestamps, our models are trained on simulated light curves to distinguish between microlensing by point-like and extended lenses, as well as from other object classes which give a variable magnitude. We show that boson stars, examples of objects with a relatively flat mass distribution, can be confidently identified for $0.8 \lesssim r/r_E\lesssim 3$. Intriguingly, we also find that more sharply peaked structures, such as NFW-subhalos, can be distinctly recognized from point-lenses under regular observation cadence. Our findings significantly advance the potential of microlensing data in uncovering the elusive nature of extended dark objects. The code and dataset used are also provided.</description>

      <title>First search for dark photon dark matter with a MADMAX prototype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first result from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from ${78.62}$ to $83.95~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a dielectric haloscope prototype for MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion eXperiment). Putative dark photons would convert to observable photons within a stack consisting of three sapphire disks and a mirror. The emitted power of this system is received by an antenna and successively digitized using a low-noise receiver. No dark photon signal has been observed. Assuming unpolarized dark photon dark matter with a local density of $\rho_{\chi}=0.3~\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ we exclude a dark photon to photon mixing parameter $\chi &gt; 2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ over the full mass range and $\chi &gt; 1.1 \times 10^{-13}$ at a mass of $80.57~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a 95\% confidence level. This is the first physics result from a MADMAX prototype and exceeds previous constraints on $\chi$ in this mass range by up to almost three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We find that the cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of galaxies is approximately degenerate with the HOD parameters, and hence it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_{m}= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$~km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain the galaxy-dark matter connection.</description>

      <title>Kick it like DESI: PNGB quintessence with a dynamically generated initial velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the hint for time-dependent dynamical dark energy from an analysis of the DESI Baryon Accoustic Oscillation (BAO) data together with information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Supernovae (SN), we relax the assumption of a vanishing initial velocity for a quintessence field. In particular we focus on pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (PNGB) quintessence in the form of an axion like particle, that can arise as the phase of a complex scalar and could possess derivative couplings to fermions or topological couplings to abelian gauge fields, without upsetting the necessary flatness of its potential. We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for sourcing an initial axion field velocity $\dot{\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\leq z\leq 10$, that will "kick" it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the axion will first roll up in its potential, similar to "freezing" dark energy. After it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll down, and behave as "thawing" quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake a combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a scenario with $\dot{\theta_i}=\mathcal{O}(1) \; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass, is slightly preferred over both $\Lambda$CDM and the conventional "thawing" quintessence with $\dot{\theta_i}=0$. The best fit points for this case exhibit transplanckian decay constants and very flat potentials, which both are in tension with conjectures from string theory.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation via Inverted Bubble Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation through inverted bubble collapse. In this scenario, bubbles nucleate sparsely in an incomplete first-order phase transition, followed by a bulk phase transition in the rest of the universe that inverts these pre-existing bubbles into false vacuum regions. These spherically symmetric false-vacuum bubbles subsequently collapse to form PBHs. Unlike conventional PBH formation mechanisms associated with domain wall collapse or bubble coalescence, our inverted bubble collapse mechanism naturally ensures spherical collapse. We demonstrate that, when applied to the singlet extension of the Standard Model, this mechanism can produce highly monochromatic PBHs with masses up to ${\cal O}(10^{-7}\,\text{-}\,10^{-5}) M_\odot$, which potentially explain the microlensing events observed in the OGLE and Subaru HSC data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of these uncertainties using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction. We show that even for the final state evolution the spectral functions of target nuclei play an essential role.</description>

      <title>2025 update on $\varepsilon_K$ in the Standard Model with lattice QCD inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical results for the indirect CP violation parameter, $|\varepsilon_K|$ calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$, $|V_{us}|$, $|V_{ud}|$, $\xi_0$, $\xi_2$, $F_K$, and $m_c$ (charm quark mass). We find a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$ at the $\approx 5\sigma$ ($5.2\sigma \sim 4.6\sigma$) level between the experimental value and the theoretical value calculated directly from the standard model using lattice QCD inputs. The standard model with lattice QCD inputs describes only 65\% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$, and does not explain its remaining 35\%. We also find that this tension disappears when we use inclusive $|V_{cb}|$ which comes from the heavy quark expansion and QCD sum rules. This tension is highly correlated with the discrepancy between exclusive $|V_{cb}|$, and inclusive $|V_{cb}|$. We also present results for $|\varepsilon_K|$ obtained using the Brod-Gorbahn-Stamou (BGS) method of $u-t$ unitarity, which leads to even a stronger tension at the $5.5\sigma \sim 4.9\sigma$ level with lattice QCD inputs.</description>
