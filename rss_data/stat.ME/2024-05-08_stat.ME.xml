      <title>Adaptive design of experiments methodology for noise resistance with unreplicated experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new gradient-based adaptive sampling method is proposed for design of experiments applications which balances space filling, local refinement, and error minimization objectives while reducing reliance on delicate tuning parameters. High order local maximum entropy approximants are used for metamodelling, which take advantage of boundary-corrected kernel density estimation to increase accuracy and robustness on highly clumped datasets, as well as conferring the resulting metamodel with some robustness against data noise in the common case of unreplicated experiments. Two-dimensional test cases are analyzed against full factorial and latin hypercube designs and compare favourably. The proposed method is then applied in a unique manner to the problem of adaptive spatial resolution in time-varying non-linear functions, opening up the possibility to adapt the method to solve partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Inference With Combining Rules From Multiple Differentially Private Synthetic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has been accepted as a rigorous criterion for measuring the privacy protection offered by random mechanisms used to obtain statistics or, as we will study here, synthetic datasets from confidential data. Methods to generate such datasets are increasingly numerous, using varied tools including Bayesian models, deep neural networks and copulas. However, little is still known about how to properly perform statistical inference with these differentially private synthetic (DIPS) datasets. The challenge is for the analyses to take into account the variability from the synthetic data generation in addition to the usual sampling variability. A similar challenge also occurs when missing data is imputed before analysis, and statisticians have developed appropriate inference procedures for this case, which we tend extended to the case of synthetic datasets for privacy. In this work, we study the applicability of these procedures, based on combining rules, to the analysis of DIPS datasets. Our empirical experiments show that the proposed combining rules may offer accurate inference in certain contexts, but not in all cases.</description>

      <title>Weighted Particle-Based Optimization for Efficient Generalized Posterior Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of statistical learning, the increasing volume of accessible data and increasing model complexity necessitate robust methodologies. This paper explores two branches of robust Bayesian methods in response to this trend. The first is generalized Bayesian inference, which introduces a learning rate parameter to enhance robustness against model misspecifications. The second is Gibbs posterior inference, which formulates inferential problems using generic loss functions rather than probabilistic models. In such approaches, it is necessary to calibrate the spread of the posterior distribution by selecting a learning rate parameter. The study aims to enhance the generalized posterior calibration (GPC) algorithm proposed by Syring and Martin (2019) [Biometrika, Volume 106, Issue 2, pp. 479-486]. Their algorithm chooses the learning rate to achieve the nominal frequentist coverage probability, but it is computationally intensive because it requires repeated posterior simulations for bootstrap samples. We propose a more efficient version of the GPC inspired by sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers. A target distribution with a different learning rate is evaluated without posterior simulation as in the reweighting step in SMC sampling. Thus, the proposed algorithm can reach the desired value within a few iterations. This improvement substantially reduces the computational cost of the GPC. Its efficacy is demonstrated through synthetic and real data applications.</description>

      <title>On Correlation and Prediction Interval Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pearson's correlation coefficient is a popular statistical measure to summarize the strength of association between two continuous variables. It is usually interpreted via its square as percentage of variance of one variable predicted by the other in a linear regression model. It can be generalized for multiple regression via the coefficient of determination, which is not straightforward to interpret in terms of prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose to assess the prediction accuracy of a linear model via the prediction interval reduction (PIR) by comparing the width of the prediction interval derived from this model with the width of the prediction interval obtained without this model. At the population level, PIR is one-to-one related to the correlation and the coefficient of determination. In particular, a correlation of 0.5 corresponds to a PIR of only 13%. It is also the one's complement of the coefficient of alienation introduced at the beginning of last century. We argue that PIR is easily interpretable and useful to keep in mind how difficult it is to make accurate individual predictions, an important message in the era of precision medicine and artificial intelligence. Different estimates of PIR are compared in the context of a linear model and an extension of the PIR concept to non-linear models is outlined.</description>

      <title>Dependence-based fuzzy clustering of functional time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series clustering is an important data mining task with a wide variety of applications. While most methods focus on time series taking values on the real line, very few works consider functional time series. However, functional objects frequently arise in many fields, such as actuarial science, demography or finance. Functional time series are indexed collections of infinite-dimensional curves viewed as random elements taking values in a Hilbert space. In this paper, the problem of clustering functional time series is addressed. To this aim, a distance between functional time series is introduced and used to construct a clustering procedure. The metric relies on a measure of serial dependence which can be seen as a natural extension of the classical quantile autocorrelation function to the functional setting. Since the dynamics of the series may vary over time, we adopt a fuzzy approach, which enables the procedure to locate each series into several clusters with different membership degrees. The resulting algorithm can group series generated from similar stochastic processes, reaching accurate results with series coming from a broad variety of functional models and requiring minimum hyperparameter tuning. Several simulation experiments show that the method exhibits a high clustering accuracy besides being computationally efficient. Two interesting applications involving high-frequency financial time series and age-specific mortality improvement rates illustrate the potential of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Guiding adaptive shrinkage by co-data to improve regression-based prediction and feature selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high dimensional nature of genomics data complicates feature selection, in particular in low sample size studies - not uncommon in clinical prediction settings. It is widely recognized that complementary data on the features, `co-data', may improve results. Examples are prior feature groups or p-values from a related study. Such co-data are ubiquitous in genomics settings due to the availability of public repositories. Yet, the uptake of learning methods that structurally use such co-data is limited. We review guided adaptive shrinkage methods: a class of regression-based learners that use co-data to adapt the shrinkage parameters, crucial for the performance of those learners. We discuss technical aspects, but also the applicability in terms of types of co-data that can be handled. This class of methods is contrasted with several others. In particular, group-adaptive shrinkage is compared with the better-known sparse group-lasso by evaluating feature selection. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of the guided shrinkage methodology by showing how to `do-it-yourself': we integrate implementations of a co-data learner and the spike-and-slab prior for the purpose of improving feature selection in genetics studies.</description>

      <title>A joint model for DHS and MICS surveys: Spatial modeling with anonymized locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anonymizing the GPS locations of observations can bias a spatial model's parameter estimates and attenuate spatial predictions when improperly accounted for, and is relevant in applications from public health to paleoseismology. In this work, we demonstrate that a newly introduced method for geostatistical modeling in the presence of anonymized point locations can be extended to account for more general kinds of positional uncertainty due to location anonymization, including both jittering (a form of random perturbations of GPS coordinates) and geomasking (reporting only the name of the area containing the true GPS coordinates). We further provide a numerical integration scheme that flexibly accounts for the positional uncertainty as well as spatial and covariate information.
  We apply the method to women's secondary education completion data in the 2018 Nigeria demographic and health survey (NDHS) containing jittered point locations, and the 2016 Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey (NMICS) containing geomasked locations. We show that accounting for the positional uncertainty in the surveys can improve predictions in terms of their continuous rank probability score.</description>

      <title>Combining Rollout Designs and Clustering for Causal Inference under Low-order Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects under interference is pertinent to many real-world settings. However, the true interference network may be unknown to the practitioner, precluding many existing techniques that leverage this information. A recent line of work with low-order potential outcomes models uses staggered rollout designs to obtain unbiased estimators that require no network information. However, their use of polynomial extrapolation can lead to prohibitively high variance. To address this, we propose a two-stage experimental design that restricts treatment rollout to a sub-population. We analyze the bias and variance of an interpolation-style estimator under this experimental design. Through numerical simulations, we explore the trade-off between the error attributable to the subsampling of our experimental design and the extrapolation of the estimator. Under low-order interactions models with degree greater than 1, the proposed design greatly reduces the error of the polynomial interpolation estimator, such that it outperforms baseline estimators, especially when the treatment probability is small.</description>

      <title>A goodness-of-fit diagnostic for count data derived from half-normal plots with a simulated envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods of model diagnostics may include a plethora of graphical techniques based on residual analysis, as well as formal tests (e.g. Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and Bartlett test for homogeneity of variance). In this paper we derive a new distance metric based on the half-normal plot with a simulation envelope, a graphical model evaluation method, and investigate its properties through simulation studies. The proposed metric can help to assess the fit of a given model, and also act as a model selection criterion by being comparable across models, whether based or not on a true likelihood. More specifically, it quantitatively encompasses the model evaluation principles and removes the subjective bias when closely related models are involved. We validate the technique by means of an extensive simulation study carried out using count data, and illustrate with two case studies in ecology and fisheries research.</description>

      <title>Multivariate group sequential tests for global summary statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe group sequential tests which efficiently incorporate information from multiple endpoints allowing for early stopping at pre-planned interim analyses. We formulate a testing procedure where several outcomes are examined, and interim decisions are based on a global summary statistic. An error spending approach to this problem is defined which allows for unpredictable group sizes and nuisance parameters such as the correlation between endpoints. We present and compare three methods for implementation of the testing procedure including numerical integration, the Delta approximation and Monte Carlo simulation. In our evaluation, numerical integration techniques performed best for implementation with error rate calculations accurate to five decimal places. Our proposed testing method is flexible and accommodates summary statistics derived from general, non-linear functions of endpoints informed by the statistical model. Type 1 error rates are controlled, and sample size calculations can easily be performed to satisfy power requirements.</description>

      <title>Community detection in multi-layer bipartite networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of community detection in multi-layer undirected networks has received considerable attention in recent years. However, practical scenarios often involve multi-layer bipartite networks, where each layer consists of two distinct types of nodes. Existing community detection algorithms tailored for multi-layer undirected networks are not directly applicable to multi-layer bipartite networks. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel multi-layer degree-corrected stochastic co-block model specifically designed to capture the underlying community structure within multi-layer bipartite networks. Within this framework, we propose an efficient debiased spectral co-clustering algorithm for detecting nodes' communities. We establish the consistent estimation property of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that an increased number of layers in bipartite networks improves the accuracy of community detection. Through extensive numerical experiments, we showcase the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by applying it to real-world multi-layer network datasets, yielding meaningful and insightful results.</description>

      <title>Causality Pursuit from Heterogeneous Environments via Neural Adversarial Invariance Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistics suffers from a fundamental problem, "the curse of endogeneity" -- the regression function, or more broadly the prediction risk minimizer with infinite data, may not be the target we wish to pursue. This is because when complex data are collected from multiple sources, the biases deviated from the interested (causal) association inherited in individuals or sub-populations are not expected to be canceled. Traditional remedies are of hindsight and restrictive in being tailored to prior knowledge like untestable cause-effect structures, resulting in methods that risk model misspecification and lack scalable applicability. This paper seeks to offer a purely data-driven and universally applicable method that only uses the heterogeneity of the biases in the data rather than following pre-offered commandments. Such an idea is formulated as a nonparametric invariance pursuit problem, whose goal is to unveil the invariant conditional expectation $m^\star(x)\equiv \mathbb{E}[Y^{(e)}|X_{S^\star}^{(e)}=x_{S^\star}]$ with unknown important variable set $S^\star$ across heterogeneous environments $e\in \mathcal{E}$. Under the structural causal model framework, $m^\star$ can be interpreted as certain data-driven causality in general. The paper contributes to proposing a novel framework, called Focused Adversarial Invariance Regularization (FAIR), formulated as a single minimax optimization program that can solve the general invariance pursuit problem. As illustrated by the unified non-asymptotic analysis, our adversarial estimation framework can attain provable sample-efficient estimation akin to standard regression under a minimal identification condition for various tasks and models. As an application, the FAIR-NN estimator realized by two Neural Network classes is highlighted as the first approach to attain statistically efficient estimation in general nonparametric invariance learning.</description>

      <title>Fast Computation of Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation for $k$-NN Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a fast computation method for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for $k$-nearest neighbours ($k$-NN) regression. We show that, under a tie-breaking condition for nearest neighbours, the LOOCV estimate of the mean square error for $k$-NN regression is identical to the mean square error of $(k+1)$-NN regression evaluated on the training data, multiplied by the scaling factor $(k+1)^2/k^2$. Therefore, to compute the LOOCV score, one only needs to fit $(k+1)$-NN regression only once, and does not need to repeat training-validation of $k$-NN regression for the number of training data. Numerical experiments confirm the validity of the fast computation method.</description>

Abstract: For the outlier problem in linear regression models, the Student-$t$ linear regression model is one of the common methods for robust modeling and is widely adopted in the literature. However, most of them applies it without careful theoretical consideration. This study provides the practically useful and quite simple conditions to ensure that the Student-$t$ linear regression model is robust against an outlier in the $y$-direction using regular variation theory.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian Modeling of Counts with Zero inflation and Outliers: Theoretical Robustness and Efficient Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Count data with zero inflation and large outliers are ubiquitous in many scientific applications. However, posterior analysis under a standard statistical model, such as Poisson or negative binomial distribution, is sensitive to such contamination. This study introduces a novel framework for Bayesian modeling of counts that is robust to both zero inflation and large outliers. In doing so, we introduce rescaled beta distribution and adopt it to absorb undesirable effects from zero and outlying counts. The proposed approach has two appealing features: the efficiency of the posterior computation via a custom Gibbs sampling algorithm and a theoretically guaranteed posterior robustness, where extreme outliers are automatically removed from the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by applying it to trend filtering and spatial modeling using predictive Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>Bump hunting through density curvature features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bump hunting deals with finding in sample spaces meaningful data subsets known as bumps. These have traditionally been conceived as modal or concave regions in the graph of the underlying density function. We define an abstract bump construct based on curvature functionals of the probability density. Then, we explore several alternative characterizations involving derivatives up to second order. In particular, a suitable implementation of Good and Gaskins' original concave bumps is proposed in the multivariate case. Moreover, we bring to exploratory data analysis concepts like the mean curvature and the Laplacian that have produced good results in applied domains. Our methodology addresses the approximation of the curvature functional with a plug-in kernel density estimator. We provide theoretical results that assure the asymptotic consistency of bump boundaries in the Hausdorff distance with affordable convergence rates. We also present asymptotically valid and consistent confidence regions bounding curvature bumps. The theory is illustrated through several use cases in sports analytics with datasets from the NBA, MLB and NFL. We conclude that the different curvature instances effectively combine to generate insightful visualizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03853v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: StepMix is an open-source Python package for the pseudo-likelihood estimation (one-, two- and three-step approaches) of generalized finite mixture models (latent profile and latent class analysis) with external variables (covariates and distal outcomes). In many applications in social sciences, the main objective is not only to cluster individuals into latent classes, but also to use these classes to develop more complex statistical models. These models generally divide into a measurement model that relates the latent classes to observed indicators, and a structural model that relates covariates and outcome variables to the latent classes. The measurement and structural models can be estimated jointly using the so-called one-step approach or sequentially using stepwise methods, which present significant advantages for practitioners regarding the interpretability of the estimated latent classes. In addition to the one-step approach, StepMix implements the most important stepwise estimation methods from the literature, including the bias-adjusted three-step methods with Bolk-Croon-Hagenaars and maximum likelihood corrections and the more recent two-step approach. These pseudo-likelihood estimators are presented in this paper under a unified framework as specific expectation-maximization subroutines. To facilitate and promote their adoption among the data science community, StepMix follows the object-oriented design of the scikit-learn library and provides an additional R wrapper.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Causal Synthesis for Meta-Inference on Heterogeneous Treatment Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in the potential outcome setting is biased when there exists model misspecification or unobserved confounding. As these biases are unobservable, what model to use when remains a critical open question. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian methodology to mitigate misspecification and improve estimation via a synthesis of multiple causal estimates, which we call Bayesian causal synthesis. Our development is built upon identifying a synthesis function that correctly specifies the heterogeneous treatment effect under no unobserved confounding, and achieves the irreducible bias under unobserved confounding. We show that our proposed method results in consistent estimates of the heterogeneous treatment effect; either with no bias or with irreducible bias. We provide a computational algorithm for fast posterior sampling. Several benchmark simulations and an empirical study highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach compared to existing methodologies, providing improved point and density estimation of the heterogeneous treatment effect, even under unobserved confounding.</description>

      <title>Occam Factor for Random Graphs: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, Independent Edge, and Rank-1 Stochastic Blockmodel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evidence/flexibility (i.e., "Occam") paradigm and demonstrate the theoretical and empirical consistency of Bayesian evidence for the task of determining an appropriate generative model for network data. This model selection framework involves determining a collection of candidate models, equipping each of these models' parameters with prior distributions derived via the encompassing priors method, and computing or approximating each models' evidence. We demonstrate how such a criterion may be used to select the most suitable model among the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, independent edge (IE) model, and rank-1 stochastic blockmodel (SBM). The Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi may be considered as being linearly nested within IE, a fact which permits exponential family results. The rank-1 SBM is not so ideal, so we propose a numerical method to approximate its evidence. We apply this paradigm to brain connectome data. Future work necessitates deriving and equipping additional candidate random graph models with appropriate priors so they may be included in the paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03317v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a penalized least-squares method to fit the linear regression model with fitted values that are invariant to invertible linear transformations of the design matrix. This invariance is important, for example, when practitioners have categorical predictors and interactions. Our method has the same computational cost as ridge-penalized least squares, which lacks this invariance. We derive the expected squared distance between the vector of population fitted values and its shrinkage estimator as well as the tuning parameter value that minimizes this expectation. In addition to using cross validation, we construct two estimators of this optimal tuning parameter value and study their asymptotic properties. Our numerical experiments and data examples show that our method performs similarly to ridge-penalized least-squares.</description>

      <title>Bayesian taut splines for estimating the number of modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of modes in a probability density function is representative of the complexity of a model and can also be viewed as the number of subpopulations. Despite its relevance, there has been limited research in this area. A novel approach to estimating the number of modes in the univariate setting is presented, focusing on prediction accuracy and inspired by some overlooked aspects of the problem: the need for structure in the solutions, the subjective and uncertain nature of modes, and the convenience of a holistic view that blends local and global density properties. The technique combines flexible kernel estimators and parsimonious compositional splines in the Bayesian inference paradigm, providing soft solutions and incorporating expert judgment. The procedure includes feature exploration, model selection, and mode testing, illustrated in a sports analytics case study showcasing multiple companion visualisation tools. A thorough simulation study also demonstrates that traditional modality-driven approaches paradoxically struggle to provide accurate results. In this context, the new method emerges as a top-tier alternative, offering innovative solutions for analysts.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Linear Regression with Linked Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been increasing demand for establishing privacy-preserving methodologies for modern statistics and machine learning. Differential privacy, a mathematical notion from computer science, is a rising tool offering robust privacy guarantees. Recent work focuses primarily on developing differentially private versions of individual statistical and machine learning tasks, with nontrivial upstream pre-processing typically not incorporated. An important example is when record linkage is done prior to downstream modeling. Record linkage refers to the statistical task of linking two or more data sets of the same group of entities without a unique identifier. This probabilistic procedure brings additional uncertainty to the subsequent task. In this paper, we present two differentially private algorithms for linear regression with linked data. In particular, we propose a noisy gradient method and a sufficient statistics perturbation approach for the estimation of regression coefficients. We investigate the privacy-accuracy tradeoff by providing finite-sample error bounds for the estimators, which allows us to understand the relative contributions of linkage error, estimation error, and the cost of privacy. The variances of the estimators are also discussed. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulations and an application to synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Estimation of Propensity Scores for Integrating Multiple Cohorts with High-Dimensional Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparative meta-analyses of groups of subjects by integrating multiple observational studies rely on estimated propensity scores (PSs) to mitigate covariate imbalances. However, PS estimation grapples with the theoretical and practical challenges posed by high-dimensional covariates. Motivated by an integrative analysis of breast cancer patients across seven medical centers, this paper tackles the challenges associated with integrating multiple observational datasets. The proposed inferential technique, called Bayesian Motif Submatrices for Covariates (B-MSC), addresses the curse of dimensionality by a hybrid of Bayesian and frequentist approaches. B-MSC uses nonparametric Bayesian "Chinese restaurant" processes to eliminate redundancy in the high-dimensional covariates and discover latent motifs or lower-dimensional structure. With these motifs as potential predictors, standard regression techniques can be utilized to accurately infer the PSs and facilitate covariate-balanced group comparisons. Simulations and meta-analysis of the motivating cancer investigation demonstrate the efficacy of the B-MSC approach to accurately estimate the propensity scores and efficiently address covariate imbalance when integrating observational health studies with high-dimensional covariates.</description>

      <title>A Bayes Factor Framework for Unified Parameter Estimation and Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bayes factor, the data-based updating factor of the prior to posterior odds of two hypotheses, is a natural measure of statistical evidence for one hypothesis over the other. We show how Bayes factors can also be used for parameter estimation. The key idea is to consider the Bayes factor as a function of the parameter value under the null hypothesis. This 'Bayes factor function' is inverted to obtain point estimates ('maximum evidence estimates') and interval estimates ('support intervals'), similar to how P-value functions are inverted to obtain point estimates and confidence intervals. This provides data analysts with a unified inference framework as Bayes factors (for any tested parameter value), support intervals (at any level), and point estimates can be easily read off from a plot of the Bayes factor function. This approach shares similarities but is also distinct from conventional Bayesian and frequentist approaches: It uses the Bayesian evidence calculus, but without synthesizing data and prior, and it defines statistical evidence in terms of (integrated) likelihood ratios, but also includes a natural way for dealing with nuisance parameters. Applications to real-world examples illustrate how our framework is of practical value for making quantitative inferences.</description>

      <title>Bounding Causal Effects with Leaky Instruments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are a popular and powerful tool for estimating causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. However, classical approaches rely on strong assumptions such as the $\textit{exclusion criterion}$, which states that instrumental effects must be entirely mediated by treatments. This assumption often fails in practice. When IV methods are improperly applied to data that do not meet the exclusion criterion, estimated causal effects may be badly biased. In this work, we propose a novel solution that provides $\textit{partial}$ identification in linear systems given a set of $\textit{leaky instruments}$, which are allowed to violate the exclusion criterion to some limited degree. We derive a convex optimization objective that provides provably sharp bounds on the average treatment effect under some common forms of information leakage, and implement inference procedures to quantify the uncertainty of resulting estimates. We demonstrate our method in a set of experiments with simulated data, where it performs favorably against the state of the art. An accompanying $\texttt{R}$ package, $\texttt{leakyIV}$, is available from $\texttt{CRAN}$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Penalized Transformation Models: Structured Additive Location-Scale Regression for Arbitrary Conditional Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Penalized transformation models (PTMs) are a novel form of location-scale regression. In PTMs, the shape of the response's conditional distribution is estimated directly from the data, and structured additive predictors are placed on its location and scale. The core of the model is a monotonically increasing transformation function that relates the response distribution to a reference distribution. The transformation function is equipped with a smoothness prior that regularizes how much the estimated distribution diverges from the reference distribution. These models can be seen as a bridge between conditional transformation models and generalized additive models for location, scale and shape. Markov chain Monte Carlo inference for PTMs can be conducted with the No-U-Turn sampler and offers straightforward uncertainty quantification for the conditional distribution as well as for the covariate effects. A simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. We apply the model to data from the Fourth Dutch Growth Study and the Framingham Heart Study. A full-featured implementation is available as a Python library.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most prediction and estimation situations, scientists consider various statistical models for the same problem, and naturally want to select amongst the best. Hansen et al. (2011) provide a powerful solution to this problem by the so-called model confidence set, a subset of the original set of available models that contains the best models with a given level of confidence. Importantly, model confidence sets respect the underlying selection uncertainty by being flexible in size. However, they presuppose a fixed sample size which stands in contrast to the fact that model selection and forecast evaluation are inherently sequential tasks where we successively collect new data and where the decision to continue or conclude a study may depend on the previous outcomes. In this article, we extend model confidence sets sequentially over time by relying on sequential testing methods. Recently, e-processes and confidence sequences have been introduced as new, safe methods for assessing statistical evidence. Sequential model confidence sets allow to continuously monitor the models' performances and come with time-uniform, nonasymptotic coverage guarantees.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multilevel Compositional Data Analysis: Introduction, Evaluation, and Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilevel compositional data commonly occur in various fields, particularly in intensive, longitudinal studies using ecological momentary assessments. Examples include data repeatedly measured over time that are non-negative and sum to a constant value, such as sleep-wake movement behaviours in a 24-hour day. This article presents a novel methodology for analysing multilevel compositional data using a Bayesian inference approach. This method can be used to investigate how reallocation of time between sleep-wake movement behaviours may be associated with other phenomena (e.g., emotions, cognitions) at a daily level. We explain the theoretical details of the data and the models, and outline the steps necessary to implement this method. We introduce the R package multilevelcoda to facilitate the application of this method and illustrate using a real data example. An extensive parameter recovery simulation study verified the robust performance of the method. Across all simulation conditions investigated in the simulation study, the model had minimal convergence issues (convergence rate &gt; 99%) and achieved excellent quality of parameter estimates and inference, with an average bias of 0.00 (range -0.09, 0.05) and coverage of 0.95 (range 0.93, 0.97). We conclude the article with recommendations on the use of the Bayesian compositional multilevel modelling approach, and hope to promote wider application of this method to answer robust questions using the increasingly available data from intensive, longitudinal studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a distributed variable screening method for generalized linear models. This method is designed to handle situations where both the sample size and the number of covariates are large. Specifically, the proposed method selects relevant covariates by using a sparsity-restricted surrogate likelihood estimator. It takes into account the joint effects of the covariates rather than just the marginal effect, and this characteristic enhances the reliability of the screening results. We establish the sure screening property of the proposed method, which ensures that with a high probability, the true model is included in the selected model. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed method, and an application to a real dataset showcases its practical utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.07318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In finance, durations between successive transactions are usually modeled by the autoregressive conditional duration model based on a continuous distribution omitting zero values. Zero or close-to-zero durations can be caused by either split transactions or independent transactions. We propose a discrete model allowing for excessive zero values based on the zero-inflated negative binomial distribution with score dynamics. This model allows to distinguish between the processes generating split and standard transactions. We use the existing theory on score models to establish the invertibility of the score filter and verify that sufficient conditions hold for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood of the model parameters. In an empirical study, we find that split transactions cause between 92 and 98 percent of zero and close-to-zero values. Furthermore, the loss of decimal places in the proposed approach is less severe than the incorrect treatment of zero values in continuous models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09010v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional representations of data, where each dimension corresponds to an underlying generative factor. Currently, Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are widely used for disentangled representation learning, with the majority of methods assuming independence among generative factors. However, in real-world scenarios, generative factors typically exhibit complex causal relationships. We thus design a new VAE-based framework named Disentangled Causal Variational Auto-Encoder (DCVAE), which includes a variant of autoregressive flows known as causal flows, capable of learning effective causal disentangled representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the disentanglement identifiability of DCVAE, ensuring that our model can effectively learn causal disentangled representations. The performance of DCVAE is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its outstanding capability in achieving causal disentanglement and performing intervention experiments. Moreover, DCVAE exhibits remarkable performance on downstream tasks and has the potential to learn the true causal structure among factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11122v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensitivity analyses reveal the influence of various modeling choices on the outcomes of statistical analyses. While theoretically appealing, they are overwhelmingly inefficient for complex Bayesian models. In this work, we propose sensitivity-aware amortized Bayesian inference (SA-ABI), a multifaceted approach to efficiently integrate sensitivity analyses into simulation-based inference with neural networks. First, we utilize weight sharing to encode the structural similarities between alternative likelihood and prior specifications in the training process with minimal computational overhead. Second, we leverage the rapid inference of neural networks to assess sensitivity to data perturbations and preprocessing steps. In contrast to most other Bayesian approaches, both steps circumvent the costly bottleneck of refitting the model for each choice of likelihood, prior, or data set. Finally, we propose to use deep ensembles to detect sensitivity arising from unreliable approximation (e.g., due to model misspecification). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in applied modeling problems, ranging from disease outbreak dynamics and global warming thresholds to human decision-making. Our results support sensitivity-aware inference as a default choice for amortized Bayesian workflows, automatically providing modelers with insights into otherwise hidden dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayes' rule has enabled innumerable powerful algorithms of statistical signal processing and statistical machine learning. However, when there exist model misspecifications in prior distributions and/or data distributions, the direct application of Bayes' rule is questionable. Philosophically, the key is to balance the relative importance of prior and data distributions when calculating posterior distributions: if prior (resp. data) distributions are overly conservative, we should upweight the prior belief (resp. data evidence); if prior (resp. data) distributions are overly opportunistic, we should downweight the prior belief (resp. data evidence). This paper derives a generalized Bayes' rule, called uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule, to technically realize the above philosophy, i.e., to combat the model uncertainties in prior distributions and/or data distributions. Simulated and real-world experiments on classification and estimation showcase the superiority of the presented uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule over the conventional Bayes' rule: In particular, the uncertainty-aware Bayes classifier, the uncertainty-aware Kalman filter, the uncertainty-aware particle filter, and the uncertainty-aware interactive-multiple-model filter are suggested and validated.</description>
