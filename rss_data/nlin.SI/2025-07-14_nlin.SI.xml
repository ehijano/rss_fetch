      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. III: Poisson brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, under suitable conditions, finite-dimensional systems describing invariant solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) inherit local Hamiltonian operators through the mechanism of invariant reduction, which applies uniformly to point, contact, and higher symmetries. The inherited operators endow the reduced systems with Poisson bivectors that relate constants of motion to symmetries. Applying the same mechanism to invariant conservation laws, we further show that the induced Poisson brackets agree with those of the original systems, up to sign. This is illustrated by two examples in which the inherited Poisson brackets and inherited constants of motion yield integrability of the reduced systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic scaling of growing interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of the seminal paper which introduced the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation as a paradigmatic model for random growth in 1986. We describe some of the developments to which it gave rise in mathematics and physics over the years, and some examples of applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution of internal cnoidal waves with local defects in a two-layer fluid with rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internal waves in a two-layer fluid with rotation are considered within the framework of Helfrich's f-plane extension of the Miyata-Maltseva-Choi-Camassa (MMCC) model. Within the scope of this model, we develop an asymptotic procedure which allows us to obtain a description of a large class of uni-directional waves leading to the Ostrovsky equation and allowing for the presence of shear inertial oscillations and barotropic transport. Importantly, unlike the conventional derivations leading to the Ostrovsky equation, the constructed solutions do not impose the zero-mean constraint on the initial conditions for any variable in the problem formulation. Using the constructed solutions, we model the evolution of quasi-periodic initial conditions close to the cnoidal wave solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation but having a local amplitude and/or periodicity defect, and show that such initial conditions can lead to the emergence of bursts of large internal waves and shear currents. As a by-product of our study, we show that cnoidal waves with expansion defects discussed in this work are generalised travelling waves of the KdV equation: they satisfy all conservation laws of the KdV equation (appropriately understood), as well as the Weirstrass-Erdmann conditions for broken extremals of the associated variational problem and a natural weak formulation. Being smoothed in numerical simulations, they behave, in the absence of rotation, as long-lived states with no visible evolution, while rotation changes this behaviour and leads to the emergence of strong bursts.</description>
