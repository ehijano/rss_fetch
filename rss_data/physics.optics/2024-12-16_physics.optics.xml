      <title>Laser-Induced Gas-Phase Transfer and Direct Stamping of Nanomaterials: Comparison of Nanosecond and Femtosecond Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional nanomaterial, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was cleanly transferred via a blister-based laser-induced forward-transfer method. The transfer was performed utilizing femtosecond and nanosecond laser pulses for separation distances of ~16 and ~200 micrometers between a titanium donor film deposited on a glass substrate and a silicon/silicon dioxide receiver. Transfer efficiency was examined for isolated laser pulses as well as for series of overlapping pulses and single layer transfer was confirmed. It was found that hBN is transferable for all tested combinations of pulse duration and transfer distances. The results indicate that transfer proceeds via direct stamping for short donor-to-receiver distances while, for the larger distance, the material is ejected from the donor and lands on the receiver. Furthermore, with overlapping pulses, nanosecond laser pulses enable a successful printing of hBN lines while, for fs laser pulses, the Ti film can be locally disrupted by multiple pulses and molten titanium may be transferred along with the hBN flakes. For reproducibility, and to avoid contamination with metal deposits, low laser fluence transfer with ns pulses and transfer distances smaller than the blister height provide the most favourable and reproducible condition.</description>

      <title>waveOrder: generalist framework for label-agnostic computational microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlative computational microscopy is accelerating the mapping of dynamic biological systems by integrating morphological and molecular measurements across spatial scales, from organelles to entire organisms. Visualization, measurement, and prediction of interactions among the components of biological systems can be accelerated by generalist computational imaging frameworks that relax the trade-offs imposed by multiplex dynamic imaging. This work reports a generalist framework for wave optical imaging of the architectural order (waveOrder) among biomolecules for encoding and decoding multiple specimen properties from a minimal set of acquired channels, with or without fluorescent labels. waveOrder expresses material properties in terms of elegant physically motivated basis vectors directly interpretable as phase, absorption, birefringence, diattenuation, and fluorophore density; and it expresses image data in terms of directly measurable Stokes parameters. We report a corresponding multi-channel reconstruction algorithm to recover specimen properties in multiple contrast modes. With this framework, we implement multiple 3D computational microscopy methods, including quantitative phase imaging, quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization, and fluorescence deconvolution imaging, across scales ranging from organelles to whole zebrafish. These advances are available via an extensible open-source computational imaging library, waveOrder, and a napari plugin, recOrder.</description>

      <title>Fast square-oscillations in semiconductor VCSELs with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the generation of self-sustained and fast square oscillations from the TE mode of semiconductor VCSELs with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback. We find that the low frequency switching originates from the rotation of the TE and TM modes facilitated by a long time delay, but the fast oscillations are anchored to the frequency beating between the TE and TM modes and are modified by a half-wavelength ($\lambda/2$) plate. A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the nonlinear dynamics is conducted and the related mechanism is discussed. Our study not only deepens our comprehension of laser nonlinear dynamics but also offers an all-optical approach for producing specialized signals, which could be instrumental in applications such as optical communications and photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Geometry of Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Enabled by Magnetization Multipole of Berry Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) is a fundamental tool in magnetometry, pivotal for advancing research in optics, magnetism, and spintronics as a direct probe of magnetization. Traditional MOKE measurements primarily detect the magnetization components parallel to the Poynting vector, which can only access the magnitude but not the direction of the orthogonal component. In this study, we introduce an orthogonal MOKE geometry in which the Kerr signal detects both the magnitude and direction of the magnetization component perpendicular to the Poynting vector. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this orthogonal geometry through the MOKE measurements in cubic ferromagnets and van der Waals ferromagnet. We theoretically show that the orthogonal MOKE geometry is enabled by the multipolar structure of Berry curvature in the magnetization space, which generally induces a Voigt vector orthogonal to the magnetization, thereby accounting for the unique magnetization angle dependence distinct from conventional MOKE. The establishment of the orthogonal MOKE geometry not only introduces a new paradigm for magneto-optical measurements but also provides a framework for exploring the magnetization multipoles of Berry curvature across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Reviving holographic photonic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integration of thick holograms in waveguiding structures could be considered the chimera of photonics; multi-faceted and hard to tame. It is the fundamental, and hence indispensable, concept behind compact and monolithically integrated linear optical transformation1. The true relevance of this becomes apparent in the high-dimensional context of unconventional optical computing, that is, in optical neural networks. Yet, integrating such holographic connections is very challenging. It demands high fabrication accuracy, and numerical design of the circuit is often non-tractable for large architectures. Both challenges are intrinsically linked to the usually large refractive index differences between sections of such holographic optical waveguides when using standard techniques of silicon photonics.</description>

      <title>Thermal atoms facilitate intensity clipping between vectorial dual-beam generated by a single metasurface chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating vector beams is pivotal in fields such as particle manipulation, image processing, and quantum communication. Flexibly adjusting the intensity distribution of these beams is crucial for effectively realizing these applications. This study introduces a vectorial dual-beam system utilizing thermal atoms as the medium for modulating the intensity profile of vector beams. A single metasurface is employed to generate both the control and signal vector beams, each with unique vectorial characteristics. The shaping of the signal beam profile is facilitated by the interaction with thermal atoms, which can be controlled by adjusting the control vector beam. This spatially selective absorption is a result of the thermal atoms' response to the varying polarizations within the vector beams. In this experiment, two distinct metasurface chips are fabricated to generate vector beams with doughnut-shaped and Gaussian-shaped intensity profiles. By adjusting the incident power and polarization state of the control light, the doughnut-shaped signal beams can be converted into a rotational dual-lobed pattern or the dimensions of the Gaussian-distributed signal beams can be modified. This study introduces a novel vector beam shaping technique by integrating metasurfaces with thermal atoms, offering significant promise for future applications requiring miniaturization, dynamic operation, and versatile control capabilities.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant Optical Injection Locking in Quantum Cascade Laser Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical injection locking of the repetition frequency of a quantum cascade laser frequency comb is demonstrated using an intensity modulated near-infrared light at 1.55 $\mu$m illuminating the front facet of the laser. Compared to the traditional electrical modulation approach, the introduced technique presents benefits from several perspectives such as the availability of mature and high bandwidth equipment in the near-infrared, circumvent the need of dedicated electronic components for the quantum cascade laser, and allows a direct link between the near and mid-infrared for amplitude to frequency modulation. We show that this stabilization scheme, used with a moderate near-infrared power of 5 mW, allows a tight lock to a radio-frequency generator with less than 1 mrad residual phase noise at 1 s integration time. We also perform a full characterization of the mechanism and evidence that the locking range follows Adler's law. A comparison with our recent characterization of the traditional method indicates that the optical approach could potentially lead to lower phase noise, which would benefit mid-infrared spectroscopy and metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Electron matter waves with internal torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular momentum and torque are important principles for basic and applied physics on any spatial scales, for example, in elementary particles, cold gases, optical tweezers, quantum information technology, metamaterials, gyroscopes or astrophysical entities. Investigating or controlling angular momentum in atoms or sub-atomic structures requires torque on femtosecond and picometer scales, far below the capabilities of laser light. Here we shape the electrons in an electron microscope into wave packets with a time-dependent chirality and internal torque. We intersect the electron beam with chiral laser light to create discrete energy sidebands by multiple helical photon absorptions that create a correlation between orbital angular momentum and kinetic energy. Dispersion of these partial waves due to the electron rest mass then converts each single electron into a wave function with internal torque. Under our control, a left-handed matter wave becomes right-handed in femtosecond times. Such quantum objects will facilitate research on angular momentum and chirality on atomic and sub-atomic scales.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vector Soliton Singlets and Pairs in Self-Mode-Locked Tm-Doped Fibre Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector solitons present unique optical pulses characterised by coupled orthogonal polarisation components, offering rich, multidimensional dynamics. Their enhanced degrees of freedom make them highly versatile for exploring nonlinear wave phenomena and enabling advanced applications in optical communications and ultrafast technologies. Despite significant recent progress, the intricate dynamics of vector soliton generation remain largely unexplored, particularly their interaction and coupling mechanisms. This study characterises soliton build-up dynamics in a self-mode-locked Tm-doped fibre laser, where both cavity birefringence and distributed saturable absorber play significant roles in the intracavity pulse shaping. The recorded single-shot spectra using the Dispersive Fourier Transform technique reveal generation regimes of singlet solitons and loosely bound two-pulse states. In later case, the observed intensity-dependent temporal splitting of vector soliton polarisations is also affected by the repulsive forces due to the interaction with synchronised and unsynchronised dispersive waves, governing the transition from transient pulse formation to steady-state generation. This study enhances our understanding of vector soliton dynamics and sets a solid foundation for further advanced exploration of their generation regimes across a wide range of nonlinear photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic results of new-generation dispersive element test samples based on Bragg structures in fused silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive diagnostics of new-generation dispersive elements based on Bragg structures was completed. The influence of inscription parameters on the properties of samples was studied and a threshold inscription intensity of ~ 6.38 TW/cm2 at which the linear absorption coefficient as well as the phase and polarization stresses sharply increase was found. When inscription is made with an average intensity below the threshold, the linear absorption in dry silica samples remains at a level of 10-5 cm-1, which is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of currently available commercial samples. The measured values of the dispersion characteristics using a white light interferometer coincided are in a good agreement with the calculated values provided by the manufacturer. The results of the diagnostics show that the new-generation dispersive elements are promising for compressing kilowatt-level radiation of average power.</description>

      <title>Extracting Complete Resonance Characteristics From the Phase of Physical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances are common in wave physics and their full and rigorous characterization is crucial to correctly tailor the response of a system in both time and frequency domains. However, they have been conventionally described by the quality factor, a real-valued number quantifying the sharpness of a single peak in the amplitude spectrum, and associated with a singularity in the complex frequency plane. But the amplitude of a physical signal does not hold all the information on the resonance and it has not been established that even the knowledge of the full distribution of singularities carries this information. Here we derive a quality function that fully characterizes resonances from the knowledge of the phase spectrum of the signal. This function is driven by the spectral derivative of the phase and does not require the amplitude of the signal. It can be obtained by numerically calculating the spectral derivative of the phase from numerical or experimental acquisitions of the phase spectrum. Alternatively, it can be retrieved from the distribution of poles and zeros in the complex frequency plane through an analytic expression, which demonstrates that singularities do not suffice to fully characterize the resonances and that both singularities and zeros must be taken into account to retrieve the quality function. This approach permits to extract all the characteristics of resonances from arbitrary spectral response functions without a priori knowledge on the physical system.</description>

      <title>Resonance-free deep ultraviolet to near infrared supercontinuum generation in a hollow-core antiresonant fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercontinuum generation in the ultraviolet spectral region is challenging in solid-core optical fibres due to solarization and photodarkening. Antiresonant hollow-core fibres have overcome this limitation and have been shown to guide ultraviolet light at sufficient intensity for ultraviolet spectral broadening through nonlinear optics in the filling gas. However, their ultraviolet guidance is usually limited by discontinuities caused by the presence of high-loss resonance bands. In this paper, we report on resonance-free supercontinuum generation spanning from the deep ultraviolet to the near infrared achieved through modulation instability in an argon-filled antiresonant hollow-core fibre. The fibre was directly fabricated using the stack-and-draw method with a wall thickness of approximately 90 nm, enabling continuous spectral coverage from the deep ultraviolet to the near infrared. We also report numerical simulations to investigate the supercontinuum bandwidth and the factors limiting it, finding that the overall dispersion landscape, and associated group-velocity matching of cross-phase modulation interactions, is the dominant constraint on spectral extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report ring resonators on a silicon germanium on silicon platform operating in the mid-infrared wavelength range around 3.5 - 4.6 {\mu}m with quality factors reaching up to one million. Advances in fabrication technology enable us to demonstrate such high Q-factors, which put silicon germanium at the forefront of mid-infrared integrated photonic platforms. The achievement of high Q is attested by the observation of degeneracy lifting between clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) resonances, as well as optical bistability due to an efficient power buildup in the rings.</description>

      <title>Iterating the Transient Light Transport Matrix for Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active imaging systems sample the Transient Light Transport Matrix (TLTM) for a scene by sequentially illuminating various positions in this scene using a controllable light source, and then measuring the resulting spatiotemporal light transport with time of flight (ToF) sensors. Time-resolved Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging employs an active imaging system that measures part of the TLTM of an intermediary relay surface, and uses the indirect reflections of light encoded within this TLTM to "see around corners". Such imaging systems have applications in diverse areas such as disaster response, remote surveillance, and autonomous navigation. While existing NLOS imaging systems usually measure a subset of the full TLTM, development of customized gated Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays \cite{riccardo_fast-gated_2022} has made it feasible to probe the full measurement space. In this work, we demonstrate that the full TLTM on the relay surface can be processed with efficient algorithms to computationally focus and detect our illumination in different parts of the hidden scene, turning the relay surface into a second-order active imaging system. These algorithms allow us to iterate on the measured, first-order TLTM, and extract a \textbf{second order TLTM for surfaces in the hidden scene}. We showcase three applications of TLTMs in NLOS imaging: (1) Scene Relighting with novel illumination, (2) Separation of direct and indirect components of light transport in the hidden scene, and (3) Dual Photography. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that SPAD arrays enable parallel acquisition of photons, effectively mitigating long acquisition times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly correlated biphoton states are powerful resources in quantum optics, both for fundamental tests of the theory and practical applications. In particular, high-dimensional spatial correlation has been used in several quantum information processing and sensing tasks, for instance, in ghost imaging experiments along with several quantum key distribution protocols. Here, we introduce a technique that exploits spatial correlations, whereby one can nonlocally access the result of an arbitrary unitary operator on an arbitrary input state without the need to perform any operation themselves. The method is experimentally validated on a set of spatially periodic unitary operations in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces. Our findings pave the way for efficiently distributing quantum simulations and computations in future instances of quantum networks where users with limited resources can nonlocally access the results of complex unitary transformations via a centrally located quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging with X-rays</title>

Abstract: Quantum imaging encompasses a broad range of methods that exploit the quantum properties of light to capture information about an object. One such approach involves using a two-photon quantum state, where only one photon interacts with the object being imaged while its entangled partner carries spatial or temporal information. To implement this technique, it is necessary to generate specific quantum states of light and detect photons at the single-photon level. While this method has been successfully demonstrated in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, extending it to X-rays has faced significant challenges due to the difficulties in producing a sufficient rate of X-ray photon pairs and detecting them with adequate resolution. Here, we demonstrate record high rates of correlated X-ray photon pairs produced via a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process and we employ these photons to perform quantum correlation imaging of several objects, including a biological sample (E. cardamomum seedpod). Notably, we report an unprecedented detection rate of about 6,300 pairs per hour and the observation of energy anti-correlation for the X-ray photon pairs. We also present a detailed analysis of the properties of the down-converted X-ray photons, as well as a comprehensive study of the correlation imaging formation, including a study of distortions and corrections. These results mark a substantial advancement in X-ray quantum imaging, expanding the possibilities of X-ray quantum optical technologies, and illustrating the pathway towards enhancing biological imaging with reduced radiation doses.</description>

      <title>Observation of edge solitons and their phase transition in a trimer circuit lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nonlinear topological systems, edge solitons emerge either as bifurcations of linear topological edge states or as nonlinearity-induced localized states without topological protection. Although electrical circuits have proven to be a versatile platform for realizing various types of topological insulators, observing edge solitons and their phase transition in circuit lattices remains challenging. Here, we realize quench dynamics in nonlinear electrical circuits and experimentally demonstrate the existence of both topological and nontopological edge solitons in a trimer circuit lattice, as well as the phase transition between these two types of edge solitons. Under weak nonlinearity, we observe antisymmetric and symmetric edge solitons bifurcating from their respective linear topological edge states. In contrast, under strong nonlinearity, nontopological edge solitons with antisymmetric, symmetric, and asymmetric internal structures are discovered. Our work paves the way for exploring exotic nonlinear states and novel phase diagrams in nonlinear topological systems.</description>

      <title>Large trion binding energy in monolayer WS$_2$ via strain-enhanced electron-phonon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides and related layered materials in their monolayer and a few layers thicknesses regime provide a promising optoelectronic platform for exploring the excitonic- and many-body physics. Strain engineering has emerged as a potent technique for tuning the excitonic properties favorable for exciton-based devices. We have investigated the effects of nanoparticle-induced local strain on the optical properties of exciton, $X^0$, and trion, $X^\text{-}$, in monolayer WS$_2$. Biaxial tensile strain up to 2.0% was quantified and verified by monitoring the changes in three prominent Raman modes of WS$_2$: E${^1_{2g}}$($\Gamma$), A$_{1g}$, and 2LA(M). We obtained a remarkable increase of 34 meV in $X^\text{-}$ binding energy with an average tuning rate of 17.5 $\pm$ 2.5 meV/% strain across all the samples irrespective of the surrounding dielectric environment of monolayer WS$_2$ and the sample preparation conditions. At the highest tensile strain of $\approx$2%, we have achieved the largest binding energy $\approx$100 meV for $X^\text{-}$, leading to its enhanced emission intensity and thermal stability. By investigating strain-induced linewidth broadening and deformation potentials of both $X^0$ and $X^\text{-}$ emission, we elucidate that the increase in $X^\text{-}$ binding energy is due to strain-enhanced electron-phonon coupling. This work holds relevance for future $X^\text{-}$-based nano-opto-electro-mechanical systems and devices.</description>

      <title>Excitable response of a noisy adaptive network of spiking lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze experimentally and theoretically the response of a network of spiking nodes to external perturbations. The experimental system consists of an array of semiconductor lasers that are adaptively coupled through an optoelectronic feedback signal. This coupling signal can be tuned from one to all to globally coupled and makes the network collectively excitable. We relate the excitable response of the network to the existence of a separatrix in phase space and analyze the effect of noise close to this separatrix. We find numerically that larger networks are more robust to uncorrelated noise sources in the nodes than small networks, in contrast to the experimental observations. We remove this discrepancy considering the impact of a global noise term in the adaptive coupling signal and discuss our observations in relation to the network structure.</description>

      <title>Coherent radiation of modulated positron bunch formed in crystalline undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planar channeling of the positrons of a bunch taking into account medium polarization is considered, which entails it's radiation at both soft and hard photons at a zero angle. Spatially uniphase charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. This phenomenon can only occur in microundulators with account of the polarization. The crystalline undulator (CU) parameters (the spatial period and the amplitude) are chosen to preserve the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CU radiation (CUR) from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation hinges on the modulation depth of a microbunch. The latter, an important parameter of a bunch, will also be possible to determine as a result of the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific scenario involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE FEL process at the wavelength corresponding to the SASE FEL.</description>

      <title>Tailoring sub-Doppler spectra of thermal atoms with a dielectric optical metasurface chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact and robust structures to precisely control and acquire atomic spectra are increasingly important for the pursuit of widespread applications. Sub-Doppler responses of thermal atoms are critical in constructing high-precision devices and systems. In this study, we designed a nanograting metasurface specifically for atomic rubidium vapor and integrated it into a miniature vapor cell. Using the metasurface with built-in multifunctional controls for light, we established pump-probe atomic spectroscopy and experimentally observed sub-Doppler responses at low incident power. Moreover, the sub-Doppler lineshape can be tailored by varying the incident polarization state. The spectrum transformation from absorption to transparency was observed. Using one of the sharp responses, laser stabilization with a stability of $3\times10^{-10}$ at 2 s can be achieved. Our work reveals the effective control of atomic spectra with optical metasurface chips, which may have great potential for future developments in fundamental optics and novel optical applications.</description>

      <title>Does light slowdown in dielectric media?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations and theoretical principles suggest that electromagnetic waves, including light, travel more slowly in dielectric media than in vacuum. Maxwell's equations, incorporating material dependent permittivity and permeability, elegantly capture this effect. Previous studies indicate that the observed slower speed is due to interference effects, with the actual electromagnetic fields in the dielectric propagating at the speed of light in vacuum. However, these studies did not provide explicit expressions for the field components moving at this speed. The aim of the present study is to address this gap by analysing the structure of the electromagnetic field components within the dielectric. We examine how these components, each traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, interact to produce a net field that appears to propagate more slowly. Our findings show that the observed slower propagation in dielectric media results from interference between two types of waves: a forward moving incident wave and a set of secondary waves, moving both in the forward and backward directions, and induced by the interaction of the incident wave with the dielectric medium. Both the incident wave and the secondary waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum. Importantly, we observe that the reflected wave caused by the impedance discontinuity at the boundary of the dielectric medium arises from secondary waves moving in the direction opposite to the incident wave.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Super-Resolution Imaging Without Prior Knowledge Using a Programmable Spatial-Mode Sorter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an imaging system tasked with estimating the angular distance between two incoherently-emitting, identically bright, sub-Rayleigh-separated point sources, without any prior knowledge of the centroid or the constellation and with a fixed collected-photon budget. It was shown theoretically that splitting the optical recording time into two stages -- focal-plane direct imaging to obtain a pre-estimate of the centroid, and using that estimate to center a spatial-mode sorter followed by photon detection of the sorted modes -- can achieve lower mean squared error in estimating the separation~\cite{Grace:20}. In this paper, we demonstrate this in a proof-of-concept, using a programmable mode sorter we have built using multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) using a reflective spatial-light modulator (SLM) in an emulated experiment where we use a single coherent source to characterize the MPLC to electronically piece together the signature from two closely-separated quasi-monochromatic incoherent emitters. We show an improvement in estimator variance when compared to direct imaging, in good agreement with simulations.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient, tunable, electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast and highly efficient dynamic optical metasurfaces enabling truly spatiotemporal control over optical radiation are poised to revolutionize modern optics and photonics, but their practical realization remains elusive. In this work, we demonstrate highly efficient electro-optic metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) operating in reflection that are amenable for ultrafast operation and thereby spatiotemporal control over reflected optical fields. The material configuration consists of a lithium niobate thin film sandwiched between an optically thick gold back-reflector and a grating of gold nanoridges also functioning as control electrodes. Metasurfaces for optical free-space intensity modulation are designed by utilizing the electro-optic Pockels effect in combination with an ultra-narrow qBIC resonance, whose wavelength can be finely tuned by varying the angle of light incidence. The fabricated electro-optic metasurfaces operate at telecom wavelengths with the modulation depth reaching 95 % (modulating thereby 35 % of the total incident power) for a bias voltage of +/-30 V within the electrical bandwidth of 125 MHz. Leveraging the highly angle-dependent qBIC resonance realized, we demonstrate electrically tunable phase contrast imaging using the fabricated metasurface. Moreover, given the potential bandwidth of 39 GHz estimated for the metasurface pixel size of 22 $\mu$m, the demonstrated electro-optic metasurfaces promise successful realization of unique optical functions, such as harmonic beam steering and spatiotemporal shaping as well as nonreciprocal operation.</description>

      <title>Generation of massively entangled bright states of light during harmonic generation in resonant media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the fundamental level, full description of light-matter interaction requires quantum treatment of both matter and light. However, for standard light sources generating intense laser pulses carrying quadrillions of photons in a coherent state, the classical description of light during intense laser-matter interaction has been expected to be adequate. Here we show how nonlinear optical response of matter can be controlled to generate dramatic deviations from this standard picture, including generation of several squeezed and entangled harmonics of the incident laser light. In particular, such non-trivial quantum states of harmonics are generated as soon as one of the harmonics induces a transition between different laser-dressed states of the material system. Such transitions generate an entangled light-matter wavefunction, which can generate quantum states of harmonics even in the absence of a quantum driving field or material correlations. In turn, entanglement of the material system with a single harmonic generates and controls entanglement between different harmonics. Hence, nonlinear media that are near-resonant with at least one of the harmonics appear to be quite attractive for controlled generation of massively entangled quantum states of light. Our analysis opens remarkable opportunities at the interface of attosecond physics and quantum optics, with implications for quantum information science.</description>

Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>
