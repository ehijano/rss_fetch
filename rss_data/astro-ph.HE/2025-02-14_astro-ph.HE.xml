      <title>Flip-flop QPO changes during state transitions: a case study of GX339-4 and theoretical discussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the 2021 outburst from the black hole X-ray binary GX339-4 observed by NICER around the hard to soft transition, when the system exhibits flip-flops between two distinct luminosity states: a bright state with a 5-6 Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) and a dim state showing only strong broadband noise. Despite the marked differences in variability patterns between these states, the spectral energy distributions remain strikingly similar, with only minor changes in the black body component in the soft X-ray range. We find that the QPO frequency correlates with the X-ray count rates and hardness, suggesting a tight coupling between the QPO mechanism and the accretion disc's spectral properties. Additionally, we demonstrate that flip-flops can occur on very short timescales, with almost 50 state changes within ~1200 s, while both states can also remain stable over longer periods (at least 1000 s). We explore various QPO models to explain these observations, including the possibility that the corona's accretion speed is near the sound speed, affecting the presence of QPOs. However, the exact mechanism driving the flip-flops and the QPOs remains unclear. Our findings emphasize the complexity of these phenomena and the necessity for further theoretical and observational studies to unravel the intricacies of QPO and flip-flop behaviours in X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>The Bulk Motion of Gas in the Core of the Centaurus Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe, contain vast amounts of dark matter, galaxies, and hot ionised gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the ICM appears to cool radiatively faster than the age of the cluster, but the absence of line emission from the predicted cooling rate suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (``sloshing'') motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for the distribution of heat from the outside of the core. Here we present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the core of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the XRISM satellite. We find that the hot gas is streaming along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy (NGC 4696), with relative velocities varying from 130 km/s to 310 km/s within ~ 30 kpc of the centre, indicating a structured bulk flow ("wind") blowing in the core. This wind is consistent with the core gas sloshing. While the wind may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre of the cluster, it could also distribute the heat injected by the central AGN and/or bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM, thus contributing to the thermal balance at the cluster centre. The velocity dispersion (turbulent velocity) of the gas is found to be only ~&lt; 120 km/s (corresponding to a Mach number M ~&lt; 0.2) in the core, even within ~ 10 kpc of the AGN. This may indicate that the influence of the AGN on the motion of the surrounding ICM is limited in the Centaurus cluster.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spin-down in Collapsars in 3D Neutrino Transport GRMHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collapsars -- massive stars whose cores promptly collapse into black holes (BHs) -- can power long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) via relativistic, collimated, electromagnetically-driven outflows, or jets. Their power depends on the BH magnetic field strength and spin. To survive the infalling stellar material, jets need the central BH to attain dynamically important magnetic fields that can suppress the mass inflow and lead to a magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Previous work found that non-radiative MADs can spin down their BHs to an equilibrium spin, $a_{\rm eq}^\text{nr}=0.035-0.07$. Such low spins result in extremely low power jets that may struggle to escape out of the star. However, the dense and hot collapsar disks emit neutrinos that cool the disk, reduce its thickness, and increase the angular momentum supply to the BH. Using 3D two-moment neutrino-transport general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we show for the first time that successful collapsar jets powered by neutrino-cooled disks still rapidly spin down their BHs, although to a higher $a_{\rm eq}\approx 0.13$. This value is consistent with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA inferred spins, is $2-4$x higher than for non-radiative MADs, and results in $4-16$x more powerful LGRB jets, which are more capable of drilling out of the progenitor star. This value of $a_{\rm eq}$ holds across a wide range of progenitor structures and mass accretion rates, $\dot{m} \sim(0.1-10)M_{\odot}/\rm{s}$. We find that for typical LGRB durations, $t\gtrsim30$~s, such BHs consume sufficient mass to reach $a_{\rm eq} \approx 0.13$ by LGRB's end. However, shorter or lower-$\dot{m}$ LGRBs can leave behind more rapidly spinning BHs.</description>

      <title>The spectral shapes of Galactic gamma-ray source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by ground-based gamma-ray telescopes have led to the publication of catalogs listing sources observed in the TeV and PeV energy ranges. Photons of such high energy are strongly absorbed during propagation over extragalactic distances, and the catalogs are dominated by Galactic sources. Of particular interest are the observations of the LHAASO telescope, which cover a very broad energy range (from 1 to 10$^3$ TeV) and show that the spectra of all Galactic gamma-ray sources are curved, with significantly different slopes below and above $E \sim 30$ TeV. The cumulative spectrum obtained by summing the contributions of Galactic individual sources has a spectral shape that gradually softens with energy, with a slope that increases from a value of order 2.2 at $E \simeq 1$ TeV, to 2.5 at 30 TeV, and $\simeq 3.4$ at 100 TeV. It is remarkable that the smooth variation in the shape of the cumulative spectrum is obtained from the sum of contributions that have a wide range of shapes. Understanding the origin of the spectral shapes of the Galactic gamma-ray sources is a crucial challenge for high energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Consequences of a Heavy-Metal Scenario of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assume an extreme scenario, in which the arriving cosmic rays are composed of only iron nuclei at energies above $10^{19.6}\,\text{eV}\simeq40\,\text{EeV}$, while allowing a freedom in the scale of the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm{max}}$) and preserving the elongation rate and fluctuations of $X_{\rm{max}}$ predicted by models of hadronic interactions. We derive the shift of the $X_{\rm{max}}$ scale for QGSJet II-04 and Sibyll 2.3d models using the public data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. We then propose a new mass-composition model for the energy evolution of four primary species at the ultra-high energies by fitting the publicly-available $X_{\rm{max}}$ distributions. We discuss the consequences of this Heavy-metal scenario on the energy spectrum of individual primary species, hadronic interaction studies, and the effect of the Galactic magnetic field on the arrival directions.</description>

      <title>Modified Hadronic Interactions and the future of UHECR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from multiple experiments suggest that the current interaction models used in Monte Carlo simulations do not correctly reproduce the hadronic interactions in air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR). We have created a large library of UHECR simulations where the interactions at the highest energies are slightly modified in various ways - but always within the constraints of the accelerator data, without any abrupt changes with energy and without assuming any specific mechanism or dramatically new physics at the ultra-high energies. Recent results of the Pierre Auger Observatory indicate a need for a change in the prediction of the models for both the muon content at ground and the depth of the maximum of longitudinal development of the shower. In our parameter space, we find combinations of modifications that are in agreement with this analysis, however a consistent description of UHECR showers remains elusive. Our library however provides a realistic representation of the freedom in the modeling of the hadronic interactions and offers an opportunity to quantify uncertainties of various predictions. This can be particularly valuable for the design of future observatories where hadronic models are often used as input for the prediction of the performance. We demonstrate this powerful capability on several selected examples.</description>

      <title>$\nu$SpaceSim: An end-to-end simulation package to model the sensitivity of UHECR experiments to upward-moving extensive air showers sourced by cosmic neutrinos interacting in the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos act as probes of hadronic processes and offer a distinctive view into their astrophysical origins at high energies. When reaching energies on the PeV scale, $\nu_\tau$ interactions within the Earth can produce a significant flux of $\tau$-leptons. These $\tau$-leptons subsequently decay, generating upward-moving extensive air showers (EAS). Using the Earth as a target for neutrinos and the atmosphere as a signal generator effectively creates a detector with a mass $\gg$ gigaton. $\nu$SpaceSim is a comprehensive simulation developed to model all the relevant physical processes that describe the neutrino-induced, Earth-emergent lepton chain. The simulation models neutrino interactions inside the Earth that produce leptons, the propagation of the leptons through the Earth into the atmosphere, and their decay, forming composite EAS. Next, it models the generation of air optical Cherenkov and radio signals from these showers, including the propagation and attenuation of these signals through the atmosphere, accounting for effects such as clouds and the ionosphere. Finally, the simulation models the detector response according to the parameters defined by the user (such as altitude, effective area, frequency band...). Through this end-to-end simulation, $\nu$SpaceSim aims to help design the next generation of balloon- and space-based experiments, to estimate the exposure of ground-based experiments to these showers, and to understand the data from recent experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and ANITA.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Sun's and Moon's Shadows on Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale anisotropy, with amplitudes reaching approximately 0.1% at TeV energies, has been observed by multiple cosmic-ray experiments. The obstruction of cosmic rays by the Sun and Moon creates shadow effects, potentially impacting the observed cosmic ray anisotropy. To evaluate these effects, this study calculates the contributions of the Sun's and Moon's shadows to the overall cosmic-ray anisotropy in both local solar and sidereal time. The analysis reveals that in local sidereal time, the total 1D projection amplitude of the anisotropy is around 0.003%, which is significantly smaller than the observed cosmic-ray anisotropy. This indicates that the influence of the Sun's and Moon's shadows on cosmic-ray anisotropy analysis in local sidereal time is negligible. In contrast, in local solar time, the shadow-induced deficit appears in a very small time bin, with a magnitude comparable to that of the cosmic-ray solar anisotropy. This deficit could serve as a benchmark for validating anisotropy measurements in future facilities.</description>

      <title>PSR J1231-1411 revisited: Pulse Profile Analysis of X-ray Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary goals of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)-like X-ray missions is to impose stringent constraints on the neutron star equation of state by precisely measuring their masses and radii. NICER has recently expanded the dataset of inferred mass-radius relations for neutron stars, including four rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437-4715, and PSR J1231-1411. In this work, the mass-radius relation and X-ray emitting region properties of PSR J1231-1411 are inferred with an independent pulse profile modeling based on the spherical star Schwarzschild-spacetime and Doppler approximation. With one single-temperature elongated hot spot and one single-temperature crescent hot spot, the inferred gravitational mass is $M = 1.12 \pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$ and the inferred equatorial radius is $R_{eq} = 9.91_{-0.86}^{+0.88}$ km (68% credible intervals). It provides an alternative geometry configuration of the X-ray emitting region for PSR J1231-1411 to sufficiently explain the observation data of NICER and XMM-Newton. The inferred radius is smaller than that derived by \citet{salmi2024nicer} ($M = 1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05} M_{\odot}$, $R_{eq} = 12.6 \pm 0.3$ km), and the inferred mass is slightly higher in this work. The inferred geometry configurations of the X-ray emitting region in both works are non-antipodal, which is not consistent with a centered dipole magnetic field and suggests a complex magnetic field structure.</description>

      <title>Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) I: Survey description, discovery and timing of the first pulsar in NGC 6093 (M80)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the new Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey. This survey aims to find MSPs in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using uGMRT. The observations use the uGMRT's Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, which are well suited for steep-spectral-index radio sources like MSPs; the survey will eventually cover the GCs accessible to the uGMRT sky (i.e. $\delta\:&gt;\:\sim\:-\:53^\circ$), and that is South of $\delta = -17^\circ$ (FAST sky limit) and have not been targeted with the sensitivity of this survey. The observations started in May 2023, having so far resulted in seven new discoveries. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up study of the first pulsar from this survey, J1617$-$2258A, a 4.32 ms binary MSP that is also the first to be discovered in the globular cluster NGC 6093. We localised this MSP with arc-sec precision from imaging and obtained the unique timing solution from more than one year of timing observations with the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) receivers of the uGMRT. This revealed an unusual binary MSP, with a $\sim$ 19-hour, highly eccentric (e $\sim$ 0.54) orbit having a low-mass companion. This orbital eccentricity allowed the measurement of the rate of advance of periastron for this system, which led to the derivation of its total mass, $1.67 \, \pm \, 0.06 \, \rm M_{\odot}$; this together with the system's mass function implies, for the pulsar and the companion, $M_\mathrm{p} &lt; 1.60 \, \rm M_{\odot}$ and $M_\mathrm{c} &gt; 0.072 \, \rm M_{\odot}$. The system is likely a perturbed MSP-Helium WD system seen at a low orbital inclination.</description>

      <title>Galactic Isolated Stellar-Mass Black Holes with the Magnetospheric Spark Gap as Possible GeV-TeV Gamma-ray Unidentified Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Billions of isolated stellar-mass black holes (IBHs) are thought to wander through the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Galaxy, yet only one has been detected. IBHs embedded in ISM would accrete gas via Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton accretion, and with efficient magnetic flux accumulation, the magnetosphere would be formed in the vicinity of IBHs. We explore the detectability of such IBHs through high-energy gamma rays from spark gaps in their magnetospheres based on our recent numerical simulation. The gap gamma rays can be bright at the GeV-TeV energies when IBHs are in the dense ISM. About $10^3$ and $10$ IBHs might be contained in unidentified objects of the $\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope and the High Energy Stereoscopic System, respectively. A future Galactic plane survey by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory would lead to $\sim10^2$ detections. We also evaluate the combined gamma-ray emission of IBHs in the Galaxy and find that the IBHs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse gamma rays. IBHs will emit optical and X-ray photons from their accretion disk as counterparts, potentially useful for identifying candidates.</description>

      <title>A new long gamma-ray burst formation pathway at solar metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are generally observed in low-metallicity environments. However, 10 to 20 per cent of LGRBs at redshift $z&lt;2$ are associated with near-solar to super-solar metallicity environments, remaining unexplained by traditional LGRB formation pathways that favour low metallicity progenitors.
  Aims. In this work, we propose a novel formation channel for LGRBs that is dominant at high metallicities. We explore how a stripped primary star in a binary can be spun up by a second, stable reverse-mass-transfer phase, initiated by the companion star.
  Methods. We use POSYDON a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star mode grids, to investigate the metallicity dependence of the stable reverse-mass-transfer LGRB formation channel. We determine the available energy to power an LGRB from the rotational profile and internal structure of a collapsing star, and investigate how the predicted rate density of the proposed channel changes with different star formation histories and criteria for defining a successful LGRB.
  Results. Stable reverse mass transfer can produce rapidly rotating, stripped stars at collapse. These stars retain enough angular momentum to account for approximately 10-20% of the observed local LGRB rate density, under a reasonable assumption for the definition of a successful LGRB. However, the local rate density of LGRBs from stable reverse mass transfer can vary significantly, between 1 and 100 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, due to strong dependencies on cosmic star formation rate and metallicity evolution, as well as the assumed criteria for successful LGRBs.</description>

      <title>PSR J0952-0607: Probing the Stiffest Equations of State and r-Mode Suppression Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze PSR J0952-0607, the most massive and fastest spinning neutron star observed to date, to refine constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and investigate its robustness against r-mode instabilities. With a mass of \( 2.35 \pm 0.17 \, M_{\odot} \) and a spin frequency of 709.2 Hz, PSR J0952-0607 provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of rapid rotation on the structure of a neutron star. Using a Bayesian framework, we incorporate the rotationally corrected mass of PSR J0952-0607, alongside PSR J0740+6620's static mass measurement, to constrain the EoS. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting rotational effects leads to biases in the inferred EoS, while including the neutron star spin produces tighter constraints on pressure-density and mass-radius relations. Additionally, we explore the r-mode instability window for PSR J0952-0607 under the assumption of both rigid and elastic crust models and find that a rigid crust allows a higher stable temperature range, whereas an elastic crust places the star within the instability window under certain thermal insulation conditions.</description>

      <title>Chinese Pulsar Timing Array upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1713+0747 FAST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the gravitational-wave (GW) strain upper limits from resolvable supermassive black-hole binaries using the data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), in the context of the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array project. We focus on circular orbits in the $\mu$Hz GW frequency band between $10^{-7}$ and $3\times10^{-6}$ Hz. This frequency band is higher than the traditional pulsar timing array band and is less explored. We used the data of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1713+5307 observed between August 2019 and April 2021. A dense observation campaign was carried out in September 2020 to allow for the $\mu$Hz band coverage. Our sky-average continuous source upper limit at the 95% confidence level at 1$\mu$Hz is 1.26$\times10^{-12}$, while the same limit in the direction of the pulsar is 4.77$\times10^{-13}$.</description>

      <title>Single-Pulse Morphology of PSR J1935+1616 (B1933+16) Based on archival data from FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized archived data from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) to analyze the single-pulse profile morphology of PSR J1935$+$1616 (B1933$+$16). The results show that PSR J1935$+$1616 exhibits significant micropulses as well as various changes in single-pulse profile morphology. In the FAST archived data, a total of 969 single pulses with microstructure were identified, accounting for 9.69$\%$ of the total pulse sample, with characteristic widths of $127.63^{+70.74}_{-46.25}$ $\mu$s. About half of these pulses display quasiperiodic micropulses, with a periodicity of 231.77 $\pm$ 9.90 $\mu$s. Among the 520 single pulses with quasiperiodic microstructure, 208 also exhibit quasiperiodicity in circular polarization, with a characteristic period of $244.70^{+45.66}_{-21.05}$ $\mu$s. The micropulse characteristic width in circular polarization is 106.52 $\pm$ 46.14 $\mu$s. Compared to normal pulses, the relative energy (E/&lt;E&gt;) of single pulse with microstructure follows a double Gaussian distribution, while that of normal pulses follows a single Gaussian distribution. Based on the intensity of the leading and trailing components in the single-pulse profile morphology of PSR J1935+1616, we classified the pulses into four morphological modes (A, B, C, and D). The relative energy distribution of pulses in mode A is significantly different from the others, following a double Gaussian distribution, while the relative energy distributions in modes B, C, and D follow a single Gaussian distribution. Our study also suggests a possible correlation between micropulses and single-pulse profile morphology. Single pulse with micropulses are most likely to occur in mode A, while their occurrence is least likely in mode D.</description>

      <title>Discovery of large-scale radio emission enveloping the mini-halo in the most X-ray luminous galaxy cluster RX~J1347.5-1145</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse radio sources, known as mini-halos and halos, are detected at the centres of galaxy clusters. These centralized diffuse sources are typically observed individually, with both appearing together only in rare cases. The origin of the diffuse radio sources in such systems remains unclear. We investigate the formation of large-scale radio emission in the most X-ray luminous, massive galaxy cluster RXJ~1347.5-1145 which is known to host a mini-halo at its centre and possibly additional more extended emission. We conduct deep multi-frequency observations of the galaxy cluster using the MeerKAT at 1.28 GHz and the uGMRT (upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) at 1.26 GHz and 700 MHz. We characterize the brightness and spectral properties of the central diffuse sources and combine our radio observations with \textit{Chandra} X-ray data to explore the correlation between the cluster's non-thermal and thermal emissions. We confirm the presence of the diffuse emission and find that it extends up to 1~Mpc in size. Our multi-wavelength data reveal that the central diffuse emission consists of two distinct components: a mini-halo located in the cluster core and a larger radio halo extending around it. The correlation between radio and X-ray surface brightness in both sources indicates a strong connection between the non-thermal and thermal properties of the ICM. The differing slopes in the $I_R-I_X$ and $\alpha-I_X$ relations suggest that distinct mechanisms are responsible for the formation of the mini-halo and halo. The properties of the halo align with the turbulent model, while both turbulent and hadronic processes may contribute to the formation of the mini-halo.</description>

      <title>The main jet axis of the W49B supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify an axis connecting two opposite `ears' in the supernova remnant W49B and morphological signatures of three arcs around this axis that we claim are sections of full circum-jet rings. Based on recent identifications of morphological signatures of jets in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), including ejecta-rich axes, we reexamine images of W49B and identify a heavy element-rich protrusion (ear) as a jet-inflated structure. We identify the opposite ear and a clump at its tip as the signature of the opposite jets. The line connecting the two clumps at the tips of the two opposite ears forms the main jet axis of W49B. We compare the three arcs around the main jet axis in W49B to the circum-jet rings of the jets in the Cygnus A galaxy and deduce that these arcs are sections of full circum-jet rings in W49B. In W49B, the jets are long gone, as in some planetary nebulae with circum-jet rings. Identifying the main jet axis is incompatible with a type Ia supernova. It leaves two possibilities: that jets exploded W49B as a CCSN, i.e., the jittering jets explosion mechanism where the pair of jets we identify is one of many that exploded the star, or that the explosion was a common envelope jet supernova with a thermonuclear outburst, i.e., both the pair of jets and thermonuclear outburst exploded the core of a red supergiant star as a pre-existing neutron star tidally destroyed it.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Gamma-ray Emission Associated with the KM3NeT Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neutrino-like event with an energy of $\sim 220 \,{\rm PeV}$ was recently detected by the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope. If this neutrino comes from an astrophysical source, or from the interaction of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray in the intergalactic medium, the ultra-high-energy gamma rays that are co-produced with the neutrinos will scatter with the extragalactic background light, producing an electromagnetic cascade and resulting in emission at GeV-to-TeV energies. In this paper, we compute the gamma-ray flux from this neutrino source considering various source distances and strengths of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We find that the associated gamma-ray emission could be observed by existing imaging air cherenkov telescopes and air shower gamma-ray observatories, unless the strength of the IGMF is $B\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-13}$ G, or the ultra-high-energy gamma-rays are attenuated inside of the source itself. In the latter case, this source is expected to be radio-loud.</description>

      <title>Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first exact and analytical solution representing an equilibrium configuration of two stationary black holes, in general relativity, is presented. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed into an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta with the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$ eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

      <title>Causality constraints on radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard formula, due to Spiegel, for the smoothing of temperature fluctuations by radiative transfer is unstable in relativity. This is due to the fact that Spiegel neglected the transit time of light, thereby allowing the transport coefficients to move outside the convex geometry compatible with causality (the "hydrohedron"). Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically. All the infinite (exact) transport coefficients arising from it fall inside the hydrohedron. Our analysis also accounts for isotropic scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of deep H-alpha and [O III] images of the bright WN7/WC4 Wolf-Rayet star WR 8 (HD 62910). These data show considerably more surrounding nebulosity than seen in prior imaging. The brighter portions of the nebula span 6' in diameter and exhibit considerable fine-scale structure including numerous emission clumps and bright head-tail like features presumably due to the effects of the WR star's stellar winds. Due to the overlap of a relatively bright band of unrelated foreground diffuse interstellar H-alpha emission, WR 8's nebula is best viewed via its [O III] emission. A faint 9' x 13' diffuse outer nebulosity is detected surrounding the nebula's main ring of emission. The nebula's optical structure is substantially different from that of its thermal continuum dust emission seen in WISE 22 micron infrared images which show a smaller and sharply defined emission shell.</description>

      <title>Spectral diversity in collisional neutrino-flavor conversion: flavor equipartition or swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum kinetics of neutrinos are known to potentially change the classical neutrino radiation field in high-energy astrophysical sources such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron-star mergers. However, the mixing phenomena still have open issues in the nonlinear dynamics and the asymptotic states, particularly for recently discovered collision-induced flavor conversion. In this paper, we investigate linear and nonlinear dynamics of collisional neutrino-flavor conversion (CFC) with multi-energy neutrino gases through numerical simulations, demonstrating that the asymptotic states dramatically change depending on unstable modes dominating the system. In one unstable mode, high-energy neutrinos reach a flavor equipartition, but low-energy neutrinos return back to almost their initial states. In contrast, in the other one, rather low-energy neutrinos achieve a full flavor swap, but high-energy neutrinos undergo less flavor conversion. We clarify the distinct spectral behaviors in two different ways based on stability analysis and flavor pendulum. Our result suggests that CFC with flavor swap can become crucial at deeper radii with low electron fraction and requires more detailed theoretical modeling of neutrino quantum kinetics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are produced in binary neutron star mergers. This scenario can account for the heretofore inexplicable narrow rigidity range of UHECRs, because the jets of BNS mergers are generated by a gravitationally-driven dynamo and thus are nearly identical due to the narrow range of BNS masses. Observed UHECRs with energies well beyond 100 EeV can be explained as $r$-process nuclei, without invoking an exotic source class. Evidence for this mechanism, and its prediction of coincidences between neutrinos above 10 PeV and gravitational waves, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Diffusion in the Turbulent Interstellar Medium: Effects of Mirror Diffusion and Pitch Angle Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) interact with turbulent magnetic fields in the intestellar medium, generating nonthermal emission. After many decades of studies, the theoretical understanding of their diffusion in the ISM continues to pose a challenge. This study numerically explores a recent prediction termed "mirror diffusion" and its synergy with traditional diffusion mechanism based on gyroresonant scattering. Our study combines 3D MHD simulations of star-forming regions with test particle simulations to analyze CR diffusion. We demonstrate the significance of mirror diffusion in CR diffusion parallel to the magnetic field, when the mirroring condition is satisfied. Our results support the theoretical expectation that the resulting particle propagation arising from mirror diffusion in combination with much faster diffusion induced by gyroresonant scattering resembles a Levy-flight-like propagation. Our study highlights the necessity to reevaluate the diffusion coefficients traditionally adopeted in the ISM based on gyroresonant scattering alone. For instance, our simulations imply a diffusion coefficient $\sim10^{27}cm^2/s$ for particles with a few hundred TeV within regions spanning a few parsecs around the source. This estimate is in agreement with gamma-ray observations, which shows the relevance of our results for understanding of diffuse gamma-ray emission in star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

      <title>Seeking the nearest neutron stars using a new local electron density map</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars provide a compelling testing ground for gravity, nuclear dynamics, and physics beyond the Standard Model, and so it will be useful to locate the neutron stars nearest to Earth. To that end, we revisit pulsar distance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves scattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map for the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest pulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale. This ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously estimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which motivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near candidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for testing fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron star heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We illustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter capture.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution and mass distribution of the Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.32^{+0.29}_{-0.25}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.62^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

      <title>Timing and noise analysis of five millisecond pulsars observed with MeerKAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in binary systems are precise laboratories for tests of gravity and the physics of dense matter. Their orbits can show relativistic effects that provide a measurement of the neutron star mass and the pulsars are included in timing array experiments that search for gravitational waves. Neutron star mass measurements are key to eventually solving the neutron star equation of state and these can be obtained by a measure of the Shapiro delay if the orbit is viewed near edge-on. Here we report on the timing and noise analysis of five MSPs observed with the MeerKAT radio telescope: PSRs J0900$-$3144, J0921$-$5202, J1216$-$6410, J1327$-$0755 and J1543$-$5149. We searched for the Shapiro delay in all of the pulsars and obtain weak detections for PSRs J0900$-$3144, J1216$-$6410, and J1327$-$0755. We report a higher significance detection of the Shapiro delay for PSR J1543$-$5149, giving a precise pulsar mass of $M_{\rm p} = 1.349^{+0.043}_{-0.061}\,$M$_\odot$ and companion white-dwarf mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.223^{+0.005}_{-0.007}\,$M$_\odot$. This is an atypically low mass measurement for a recycled MSP. In addition to these Shapiro delays, we also obtain timing model parameters including proper motions and parallax constraints for most of the pulsars.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Alignment in Merging Binary Black Holes Following Collisions with Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merging binary black holes (BBHs) formed dynamically in dense star clusters are expected to have uncorrelated spin--orbit orientations since they are assembled through many random interactions. However, measured effective spins in BBHs detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA hint at additional physical processes that may introduce anisotropy. Here we address this question by exploring the impact of stellar collisions, and accretion of collision debris, on the spin--orbit alignment in merging BBHs formed in dense star clusters. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we study the regime where the disruption of a massive star by a BBH causes the stellar debris to form individual accretion disks bound to each black hole. We show that these disks, which are randomly oriented relative to the binary orbital plane after the initial disruption of the star, can be reoriented by strong tidal torques in the binary near pericenter passages. Following accretion by the BHs on longer timescales, BBHs with small but preferentially positive effective spin parameters ($\chi_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.2$) are formed. Our results indicate that BBH collisions in young massive star clusters could contribute to the observed trend toward small positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and we suggest that the standard assumption often made that dynamically assembled BBHs should have isotropically distributed BH spins is not always justified.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a neutrino flux above 5 PeV and implications for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare detections of astrophysical neutrinos with energies above 5~PeV by two neutrino telescopes underscore the existence of a flux at these energies. In addition to over a decade of data taken by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the KM3NeT neutrino telescope has recently highlighted their discovery of a possible $\mathcal{O}(100~PeV)$ neutrino candidate. A connection between the highest-energy astrophysical neutrinos and the highest-energy cosmic rays is expected, and well-established theoretically. Here, for the first time, we simultaneously fit the neutrino data from IceCube and KM3NeT, as well as the ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray spectrum and composition data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger), to test a common-origin hypothesis. We show that a phenomenological model is able to describe the combined data across these three observatories, and, depending on the true energy of the event detected by KM3NeT, suggests an additional cosmic ray source population not yet robustly detected by Auger. Although a measurement of the neutrino flux in this energy regime is at the sensitivity limit of cubic-kilometer-scale neutrino telescopes, next-generation observatories, such IceCube-Gen2, will have the sensitivity to make a significant detection of this flux.</description>

      <title>Rarity of precession and higher-order multipoles in gravitational waves from merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest binary black hole population estimates argue for a subpopulation of unequal component mass binaries with spins that are likely small but isotropically distributed. This implies a non-zero probability of detecting spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments in the observed gravitational-wave signals. In this work we directly calculate the probability for precession and higher-order multipoles in each significant gravitational-wave candidate observed by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaborations (LVK). We find that only one event shows substantial evidence for precession: GW200129_065458, and two events show substantial evidence for higher-order multipoles: GW190412 and GW190814; any evidence for precession and higher-order multipole moments in other gravitational-wave signals is consistent with random fluctuations caused by noise. We then compare our observations with expectations from population models, and confirm that current population estimates from the LVK accurately predict the number of observed events with significant evidence for precession and higher-order multipoles. In particular, we find that this population model predicts that a binary with significant evidence for precession will occur once in every $\sim 50$ detections, and a binary with significant evidence for higher-order multipoles will occur once in every $\sim 70$ observations. However, we emphasise that since substantial evidence for precession and higher-order multipoles have only been observed in three events, any population model that includes a subpopulation of binaries yielding $\sim 2\%$ of events with detectable precession and higher-order multipole moments will likely be consistent with the data.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases due to waveform mismodeling in parametrized post-Einsteinian tests of general relativity: The impact of neglecting spin precession and higher modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the robustness of parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) tests of General Relativity (GR) with gravitational waves, due to waveform inaccuracy. In particular, we determine the properties of the signal -- signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters -- such that we are led to falsely identify a ppE deviation in the post-Newtonian (PN) inspiral phase at -1PN, 1PN, or 2PN order, due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the ppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE parameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE model. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we connect various measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that apply to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Transition from adiabatic inspiral to plunge for eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be critical targets for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. They also serve as useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass ratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral can be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic orbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence is determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of motion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any moment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a ``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion. This restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the backreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body approaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and the backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO, its trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly connect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and the final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for circular systems. Here, we study the transition for binaries with eccentricity. A well-defined eccentric transition will make it possible to develop small-mass-ratio binary waveform models that terminate in a physically reasonable way, rather than abruptly terminating as an inspiral-only model ends. A model that can explore the parameter space of eccentricity may also be useful for understanding the final cycles of eccentric binaries at less extreme mass ratios, such as those likely to be observed by ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Detection of a 2.9-hour Orbit in a Long Period Radio Transient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long Period radio Transients (LPTs) are a mysterious new class of radio transients pulsating on periods of minutes to hours. So far, eight LPTs have been discovered predominantly at low Galactic latitudes, yet their nature remains unknown. Here, I present the first phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the 2.9-h LPT GLEAM-X J0704-37, acquired with the 10-m Keck I telescope. Radial velocity (RV) shifts of $189\pm 3 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$ of an M5-type star in a binary system are detected on a period nearly equal to the radio period. Weak H$\alpha$ emission is also present, with some of it possibly originating from outside of the M dwarf. Based on the RV amplitude, and assuming a typical M dwarf mass, the companion mass must be $M \geq 0.22 M_\odot$. Calibrating the spectra with space-based \textit{Gaia} photometry reveals that the system is nearly four times closer than previously reported, at $d \approx 400$ pc, suggesting that more systems could be nearby and amenable to optical characterization. The optical spectrum between 3500-10,000 Angstrom is well modeled by a binary comprised of a massive white dwarf (WD; $T_\textrm{eff}\approx$7,300 K, $M\approx0.8-1.0M_\odot$) and M dwarf ($T_\textrm{eff}\approx$3,000 K, $M\approx0.14M_\odot$). Radio pulses arrive when the WD is at nearly maximum blueshift and the M dwarf at nearly maximum redshift, in contrast to what has been reported in a similar LPT, ILT J1101+5521. GLEAM-X J0704-37 is now the second LPT with an orbital period nearly equal to the radio period, hinting at two classes of LPTs: ``long LPTs'' ($P\gtrsim$78 min) associated with WD + M dwarf binary orbits, and ``short LPTs'' ($P\lesssim$78 min) related to WD or neutron star spins. This work demonstrates that precise localization of LPTs, which enables optical follow-up, will be key in uncovering the mechanism(s) that power this new class of phenomenon.</description>
