      <title>On unboundedness of some invariants of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups in $\mathbb{N}^d$. We start with symmetric and almost symmetric $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and prove that these notions are independent of term orders. We further investigate the conductor and the Ap\'ery set of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup with respect to a minimal extremal ray. Building upon this, we extend the notion of reduced type to $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and study its extremal behavior. For all $d$ and fixed $e \geq 2d$, we give a class of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups of embedding dimension $e$ such that both the type and the reduced type do not have any upper bound in terms of the embedding dimension. We further explore irreducible decompositions of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup and give a lower bound on the irreducible components in an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, we deduce that for each positive integer $k$, there exists a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ such that the number of irreducible components of $S$ is at least $k$. A $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup is known as a generalized numerical semigroup when the rational cone spanned by the semigroup is full. We classify all the symmetric generalized numerical semigroups of embedding dimension $2d+1$. Consequently, when $d&gt;1$, we deduce that a generalized numerical semigroup of embedding dimension $2d+1$ is almost symmetric if and only if it is symmetric.</description>

      <title>Classifying smashing ideals in derived categories of valuation domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on results of Bazzoni-\v{S}\v{t}ov\'{\i}\v{c}ek, we give a complete classification of the frame of smashing ideals for the derived category of a finite dimensional valuation domain. In particular, we give an explicit construction of an infinite family of commutative rings such that the telescope conjecture fails and which generalise an example of Keller. As a consequence, we deduce that the Krull dimension of the Balmer spectrum and the Krull dimension of the smashing spectrum can differ arbitrarily for rigidly-compactly generated tensor-triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>The volume intrinsic to a commutative graded algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works of the authors have demonstrated the usefulness of considering moduli spaces of Artinian reductions of a given ring when studying standard graded rings and their Lefschetz properties. This paper illuminates a key aspect of these works, the behaviour of the canonical module under deformations in this moduli space. We demonstrate that even when there is no natural geometry around, we can give a viewpoint that behaves like it, effectively constructing geometry out of nothing, giving interpretation to intersection numbers without cycles. Moreover, we explore some properties of this normalization.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in nonassociative ordered rings and in weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, rings can be endowed with extra "structure" such as order and topology allowing us to write more complex statements. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of ordered and weak-quasi-topological rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a norm from a ring to a partially ordered ring endowed with interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem relies on the assumption of sequential Cauchy completeness of the topology induced by the norm $f$, which as we recall, takes values in an ordered ring endowed with the interval topology (an example of a coarse topology). The fact that a ring endowed with the topology associated with a seminorm into an ordered ring endowed with the interval topology is a locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional continuity property of the product is dealt with in a separate section. A brief application to frame theory is also included.</description>
