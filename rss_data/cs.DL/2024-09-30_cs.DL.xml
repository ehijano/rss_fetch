      <title>Measuring Research Interest Similarity with Transition Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to measure the similarity of papers and authors by simulating a literature search procedure on citation networks, which is an information retrieval inspired conceptualization of similarity. This transition probability (TP) based approach does not require a curated classification system, avoids clustering complications, and provides a continuous measure of similarity. We perform testing scenarios to explore several versions of the general TP concept and the Node2vec machine-learning technique. We found that TP measures outperform Node2vec in mapping the macroscopic structure of fields. The paper provides a general discussion of how to implement TP similarity measurement, with a particular focus on how to utilize publication-level information to approximate the research interest similarity of individual scientists. This paper is accompanied by a Python package capable of calculating all the tested metrics.</description>

      <title>Libros en abierto de las editoriales universitarias espa\~nolas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the set of scientific publications in open access, other than journals (monographs, conferences proceedings, teaching materials and grey literature), published by Spanish public universities, studying their volume, documentary typology, level of description and open access policies with the aim of measuring their degree of incorporation and compliance with the principles of Open Science. An exhaustive review of the disposed material in open access by these publishers has been carried out, which has allowed to make a diagnosis of their level of open access publishing. Grey literature is the most common documentary type followed by the monograph, in the open publication of these publishers that does not reach even 5% of the average editorial production. The results allow us to conclude that the academic publishing, and more specifically the academic books in open access, still has a very reduced presence within the editorial production of these institutions.</description>

      <title>LLMs4Synthesis: Leveraging Large Language Models for Scientific Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the growing complexity and volume of scientific literature, this paper introduces the LLMs4Synthesis framework, designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating high-quality scientific syntheses. This framework addresses the need for rapid, coherent, and contextually rich integration of scientific insights, leveraging both open-source and proprietary LLMs. It also examines the effectiveness of LLMs in evaluating the integrity and reliability of these syntheses, alleviating inadequacies in current quantitative metrics. Our study contributes to this field by developing a novel methodology for processing scientific papers, defining new synthesis types, and establishing nine detailed quality criteria for evaluating syntheses. The integration of LLMs with reinforcement learning and AI feedback is proposed to optimize synthesis quality, ensuring alignment with established criteria. The LLMs4Synthesis framework and its components are made available, promising to enhance both the generation and evaluation processes in scientific research synthesis.</description>
