      <title>Robust financial calibration: a Bayesian approach for neural SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a Bayesian framework for the calibration of financial models using neural stochastic differential equations (neural SDEs). The method is based on the specification of a prior distribution on the neural network weights and an adequately chosen likelihood function. The resulting posterior distribution can be seen as a mixture of different classical neural SDE models yielding robust bounds on the implied volatility surface. Both, historical financial time series data and option price data are taken into consideration, which necessitates a methodology to learn the change of measure between the risk-neutral and the historical measure. The key ingredient for a robust numerical optimization of the neural networks is to apply a Langevin-type algorithm, commonly used in the Bayesian approaches to draw posterior samples.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions at infinity for Black-Scholes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical procedure for computing the prices of forward contracts, in which the underlying asset price is a Markovian local martingale. If the underlying process is a strict local martingale, multiple solutions exist for the corresponding Black-Scholes equations, and the derivative prices are characterized as the minimal solutions. When applying numerical methods that are set up on a finite grid, such as finite difference methods, additional spatial boundary conditions are required, which causes the solution to uniquely exist. In this case, the problem is reduced to specifying the boundary conditions. Our boundary condition is based on an expression of the derivative price at infinity in terms of those at finite values, and incorporates volatility behaviors beyond the boundary. The proposed procedure is demonstrated through numerical tests, which show that it outperforms the methods proposed in the literature.</description>
