      <title>Coboundaries of 3-IETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06380v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the coboundaries of interval exchange transformations of 3 intervals (3-IETs). More precisely, we show that a differentiable function with absolutely continuous derivative with bounded variation, whose integral and integral of its derivative is 0, is a coboundary for typical 3-IET if and only if the values at the endpoints of the domain are zero. This contrasts with 2-IETs, i.e., rotations, because every continuous function is a coboundary for every rotation. We also show the existence of rare counterexamples for both cases of possible values at the endpoints of the interval. We obtain our result by studying the properties of associated skew products.</description>

      <title>Generalized dichotomies via time rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For discrete-time nonautonomous linear dynamics and a large class of discrete growth rates $\mu$, we show that the notion of $\mu$ dichotomy (with respect to a sequence of norms) can be completely characterized in terms of ordinary and exponential dichotomy (with respect to a sequence of norms) by employing a suitable rescaling of time. Previously, such a result was known only in the particular case of polynomial dichotomies. As a nontrivial application of our results, we study the structure of a generalized Sacker-Sell spectrum and obtain a series of nonautonomous topological and smooth linearization results.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous bifurcation of limit cycles for Piecewise Holomorphic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\dot{z}=f(z)$ be a holomorphic differential equation with center at $p$. In this paper we are concerned about studying the piecewise perturbation systems $\dot{z}=f(z)+\epsilon R^\pm(z,\overline{z}),$ where $R^\pm(z,\overline{z})$ are complex polynomials defined for $\pm\operatorname{Im}(z)&gt; 0.$ We provide an integral expression, similar to an Abelian integral, for the period annulus of $p.$ The zeros of this integral control the bifurcating limit cycles from the periodic orbits of this annular region. This expression is given in terms of the conformal conjugation between $\dot{z}=f(z)$ and its linearization $\dot{z}=f'(p)z$ at $p$. We use this result to control the simultaneous bifurcation of limit cycles of the two annular periods of $\dot{z}={\rm i} (z^2-1)/2$, after both complex and holomorphic piecewise polynomial perturbations. In particular, as far as we know, we provide the first proof of the existence of non nested limit cycles for piecewise holomorphic systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Two Pointwise Ergodic Theorems: Double Recurrence and Return Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to extensions of Bourgain's Double Recurrence Theorem and Bourgain's Return Times Theorem to integer parts of the Kronecker sequence, emphasizing stopping times and metric entropy. Specifically, we prove the following two results for each $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$:
  First, for each $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving system, $(X,\mu,T)$, and each $f,g \in L^{\infty}(X)$, for each $\gamma \in \mathbb{Q}$ the bilinear ergodic averages
  \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor \alpha n \rfloor } f \cdot T^{\lfloor \gamma n \rfloor} g \]
  converge $\mu$-a.e.;
  Second, for each aperiodic and countably generated measure-preserving system, $(Y,\nu,S)$, and each $g \in L^{\infty}(Y)$, there exists a subset $Y_{g} \subset Y$ with $\nu(Y_{g})= 1$ so that for all $\gamma \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $\omega \in Y_{g}$, for any auxiliary $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving system $(X,\mu,T)$, and any $f \in L^{\infty}(X)$, the ``return-times" averages \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor \alpha n \rfloor} f \cdot S^{\lfloor \gamma n \rfloor } g(\omega) \] converge $\mu$-a.e.
  Moreover, in both cases the sets of convergence are identical for all $\gamma \in \mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of hospitalization-induced behavioral changes on SARS-COV-2 spread in New York City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel behavior-epidemiology model, which considers $n$ heterogeneous behavioral groups based on level of risk tolerance and distinguishes behavioral changes by social and disease-related motivations (such as peer-influence and fear of disease-related hospitalizations), is developed. In addition to rigorously analyzing the basic qualitative features of this model, a special case is considered where the total population is stratified into two groups: risk-averse (Group 1) and risk-tolerant (Group 2). The two-group behavior model has three disease-free equilibria in the absence of disease, and their stability is analyzed using standard linearization and the properties of Metzler-stable matrices. Furthermore, the two-group model was calibrated and validated using daily hospitalization data for New York City during the first wave, and the calibrated model was used to predict the data for the second wave. Numerical simulations of the calibrated two-group behavior model showed that while the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic during the first wave was largely influenced by the behavior of the risk-tolerant individuals, the dynamics during the second wave was influenced by the behavior of individuals in both groups. It was also shown that disease-motivated behavioral changes had greater influence in significantly reducing SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality than behavior changes due to the level of peer or social influence or pressure. Finally, it is shown that the initial proportion of members in the community that are risk-averse (i.e., the proportion of individuals in Group 1 at the beginning of the pandemic) and the early and effective implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions have major impacts in reducing the size and burden of the pandemic (particularly the total SARS-CoV-2 mortality in New York City during the second wave).</description>

      <title>Multivariate Frequent Stability and Diam-Mean Equicontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and investigate multivariate versions of frequent stability and diam-mean equicontinuity. Given a natural number $m &gt; 1$, we call those notions "frequent $m$-stability" and "diam-mean $m$-equicontinuity". We use these dynamical rigidity properties to characterise systems whose factor map to the maximal equicontinuous factor (MEF) is finite-to-one for a residual set, called "almost finite-to-one extensions", or a set of full measure, called "almost surely finite-to-one extensions". In the case of a $\sigma$-compact, locally compact, abelian acting group it is shown that frequently $(m+1)$-stable systems are equivalently characterised as almost $m$-to-one extensions of their MEF. Similarly, it is shown that a system is diam-mean $(m+1)$-equicontinuous if and only if it is an almost surely $m$-to-one extension of its MEF.</description>

      <title>Additive realizations of asymptotically additive set maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a countable discrete amenable group, we investigate the conditions under which a set map into a Banach space (or more generally, a complete semi-normed space) can be realized as the ergodic sum of a vector under a group representation, such that the realization is asymptotically indistinguishable from the original map. We show that for uniformly bounded group representations, this property is characterized by the class of bounded asymptotically additive set maps, extending previous work for sequences in Banach spaces and single contractions. Additionally, we develop a relative version of this characterization, identifying conditions under which the additive realization can be chosen within a specified target set. As an application, our results generalize key aspects of thermodynamic formalism, bridging the gap between additive and non-additive frameworks.</description>

      <title>On the inverse stability of $z^n+c.$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field and $\phi(z)\in K[z]$ be a polynomial. Define $\Phi(z) := \frac{1}{\phi(z)} \in K(z).$ For $n \in\mathbb{N}^* $, let the $n$-th iterate of $\Phi(z)$ be defined as $\Phi^{(n)}(z) = \underbrace{\Phi \circ \Phi \circ \cdots \circ \Phi}_{n \text{ times}}(z).$ We express the \(\Phi^{(n)}(z)\) in its reduced form as \( \Phi^{(n)}(z) = \frac{f_{n,\phi}(z)}{g_{n,\phi}(z)}, \) where \(f_{n,\phi}(z)\) and \(g_{n,\phi}(z)\) are coprime polynomials in \(K[z]\).
  A polynomial $\phi(z) \in K[z]$ is called inversely stable over $K$ if every $g_{n,\phi}(z)$ in the sequence $\{g_{n,\phi}(z)\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is irreducible in $K[z]$. This paper investigates the inverse stability of the binomials $\phi(z) = z^d + c$ over $K$.</description>

      <title>Second quantization for classical nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using techniques from many-body quantum theory, we propose a framework for representing the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic flows through infinite-dimensional rotation systems on tori. This approach is based on a class of weighted Fock spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by a 1-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_\tau$, and endowed with commutative Banach algebra structure under the symmetric tensor product using a subconvolutive weight $w$. We describe the construction of the spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ and show that their Banach algebra spectra, $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$, decompose into a family of tori of potentially infinite dimension. Spectrally consistent unitary approximations $U^t_\tau$ of the Koopman operator acting on $\mathcal H_\tau$ are then lifted to rotation systems on these tori akin to the topological models of ergodic systems with pure point spectra in the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Our scheme also employs a procedure for representing observables of the original system by polynomial functions on finite-dimensional tori in $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$ of arbitrarily large degree, with coefficients determined from pointwise products of eigenfunctions of $U^t_\tau$. This leads to models for the Koopman evolution of observables on $L^2$ built from tensor products of finite collections of approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Numerically, the scheme is amenable to consistent data-driven implementation using kernel methods. We illustrate it with applications to Stepanoff flows on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system. Connections with quantum computing are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Return Times Theorem and Auto-Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper merely explores the proof by J. Bourgain, H. Furstenberg, Y. Katznelson and D.S. Ornstein of their return times theorem [2] and lights a corner in it regarding the role of auto-correlation (so the proof presented is by no means an original work of the author). This yields a more inherent characterization of the sequences satisfying that theorem. Some further investigation is done, examples provided and questions raised.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the strong positive recurrence (SPR) property for diffeomorphisms on closed manifolds with arbitrary dimension, and show that it has many consequences and holds in many cases. SPR diffeomorphisms can be coded by countable state Markov shifts whose transition matrices act with a spectral gap on a large Banach space, and this implies exponential decay of correlations, almost sure invariance principle, large deviations, among other properties of the ergodic measures of maximal entropy. Any $C^\infty$ smooth surface diffeomorphism with positive entropy is SPR, and there are many other examples with lesser regularity, or in higher dimension.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic components of the family $\mathrm{Sk}(p,d)$ of regular polynomial skew-products of $\mathbb{C}^2$ of degree $d\geq2$, with a fixed base $p\in\mathbb{C}[z]$. Using a homogeneous parametrization of the family, we compute the accumulation set $E$ of the bifurcation locus on the boundary of the parameter space. Then in the case $p(z)=z^d$, we construct a map $\pi_0(\mathcal{D}')\to AB_d$ from the set of unbounded hyperbolic components that do not fully accumulate on $E$, to the set of algebraic braids of degree $d$. This map induces a second surjective map $\pi_0(\mathcal{D}')\to\mathrm{Conj}(\mathfrak{S}_d)$ towards the set of conjugacy classes of permutations on $d$ letters. This article is a continuation in higher degrees of the work of Astorg-Bianchi in the quadratic case $d=2$, for which they provided a complete classification of the hyperbolic components belonging to $\pi_0(\mathcal{D}')$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the family of complex rational functions known as "Generalized McMullen maps", F(z) = z^n + a/z^n+b, for complex parameters a and b, with a nonzero, and any integer n at least 3 fixed, we reveal, and provide a combinatorial model for, some new dynamical behavior. In particular, we describe a large class of maps whose Julia sets contain both infinitely many homeomorphic copies of quadratic Julia sets and infinitely many subsets homeomorphic to a set which is obtained by starting with a quadratic Julia set, then changing a finite number of pairs of external ray landing point identifications, following an algorithm we will describe.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model of Learning and Memory Using Structurally Dynamic Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the fields of computation and neuroscience, much is still unknown about the underlying computations that enable key cognitive functions including learning, memory, abstraction and behavior. This paper proposes a mathematical and computational model of learning and memory based on a small set of bio-plausible functions that include coincidence detection, signal modulation, and reward/penalty mechanisms. Our theoretical approach proposes that these basic functions are sufficient to establish and modulate an information space over which computation can be carried out, generating signal gradients usable for inference and behavior. The computational method used to test this is a structurally dynamic cellular automaton with continuous-valued cell states and a series of recursive steps propagating over an undirected graph with the memory function embedded entirely in the creation and modulation of graph edges. The experimental results show: that the toy model can make near-optimal choices to re-discover a reward state after a single training run; that it can avoid complex penalty configurations; that signal modulation and network plasticity can generate exploratory behaviors in sparse reward environments; that the model generates context-dependent memory representations; and that it exhibits high computational efficiency because of its minimal, single-pass training requirements combined with flexible and contextual memory representation.</description>

Abstract: This is a chapter for a book in honor of Bernd Sturmfels and his contributions. We describe the contributions by Bernd Sturmfels and his collaborators in harnessing algebraic and combinatorial methods for analyzing chemical reaction networks. Topics explored include the steady-state variety, counting steady states, and the global attractor conjecture. We also recount some personal stories that highlight Sturmfels's long-lasting impact on this research area.</description>

      <title>Accuracy versus Predominance: Reassessing the validity of the quasi-steady-state approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation to the Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism is a textbook example of biochemical model reduction, derived using singular perturbation theory. However, determining the specific biochemical conditions that dictate the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation remains a challenging endeavor. Emerging research suggests that the accuracy of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation improves as the ratio of the initial enzyme concentration, $e_0$, to the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, decreases. In this work, we examine this ratio and its implications for the accuracy and validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation. Using standard tools from the analysis of ordinary differential equations, we show that while $e_0/K_M$ provides an indication of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's asymptotic accuracy, the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's predominance relies on a small ratio of $e_0$ to the Van Slyke-Cullen constant, $K$. We conclude that the magnitude of $e_0/K$ offers the most accurate measure of the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics for higher-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative behaviors are deeply embedded in structured biological and social systems. Networks are often employed to portray pairwise interactions among individuals, where network nodes represent individuals and links indicate who interacts with whom. However, it is increasingly recognized that many empirical interactions often involve triple or more individuals instead of the massively oversimplified lower-order pairwise interactions, highlighting the fundamental gap in understanding the evolution of collective cooperation for higher-order interactions with diverse scales of the number of individuals. Here, we develop a theoretical framework of evolutionary game dynamics for systematically analyzing how cooperation evolves and fixates under higher-order interactions. Specifically, we offer a simple condition under which cooperation is favored under arbitrary combinations of different orders of interactions. Compared to pairwise interactions, our findings suggest that higher-order interactions enable lower thresholds for the emergence of cooperation. Surprisingly, we show that higher-order interactions favor the evolution of cooperation in large-scale systems, which is the opposite for lower-order scenarios. Our results offer a new avenue for understanding the evolution of collective cooperation in empirical systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Savanna dynamics with grazing, browsing, and migration effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the dynamics of savanna ecosystems with grazing, browsing, and migration effects. Covering over one-eighth of the Earth's land area and supporting about one-fifth of the global population, the savanna is an ecological system whose importance has only recently garnered significant attention from biologists. The interactions between organisms in this ecosystem are highly complex, and fundamental mathematical issues remain unresolved. We rigorously analyze traveling waves in savanna systems and focus on whether trees, grass, grazers, and browsers coexist. We demonstrate the existence of various traveling waves, including waves transitioning from extinction to co-existence and waves from a grass-vegetation state (where only grass and grazers exist) to co-existence. Due to the biodiversity of species in grassland ecosystems, it is not appropriate to consider overly simplified models of competition between grasses and trees. From both a biological and mathematical perspective, factors such as animal grazing, browsing, and migration (which facilitates seed dispersal) play a crucial role in promoting ecological stability and coexistence. Additionally, we estimate the nonzero minimum value of the total plant biomass within the savanna dynamic system to better understand the persistence and stability of sustainable development within the ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conefield variant of a Converse KAM method for 3D vector fields, identifying regions through which no invariant 2-tori pass transverse to a specified direction field, is tested on some helical perturbations of an axisymmetric magnetic field in toroidal geometry. This implementation computes bounds on the slopes of invariant tori of a given class and allows to apply a subsidiary criterion for the extension of the non-existence region, saving significant computation time. The method finds regions corresponding to magnetic islands and chaos for the fieldline flow.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of Newton polygons for compositions of polynomials over the rationals. We establish sufficient conditions under which the successive vertices of the Newton polygon of the composition $ g(f^n(x)) $ with respect to a prime $ p $ can be explicitly described in terms of the Newton polygon of the polynomial $ g(x) $. Our results provide deeper insights into how the Newton polygon of a polynomial evolves under iteration and composition, with applications to the study of dynamical irreducibility, eventual stability, non-monogenity of tower of number fields, etc.</description>

      <title>Predicting System Dynamics of Universal Growth Patterns in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting dynamic behaviors is one of the goals of science in general as well as essential to many specific applications of human knowledge to real world systems. Here we introduce an analytic approach using the sigmoid growth curve to model the dynamics of individual entities within complex systems. Despite the challenges posed by nonlinearity and unpredictability in system behaviors, we demonstrate the applicability of the sigmoid curve to capture the acceleration and deceleration of growth, predicting an entitys ultimate state well in advance of reaching it. We show that our analysis can be applied to diverse systems where entities exhibit nonlinear growth using case studies of (1) customer purchasing and (2) U.S. legislation adoption. This showcases the ability to forecast months to years ahead of time, providing valuable insights for business leaders and policymakers. Moreover, our characterization of individual component dynamics offers a framework to reveal the aggregate behavior of the entire system. We introduce a classification of entities based upon similar lifepaths. This study contributes to the understanding of complex system behaviors, offering a practical tool for prediction and system behavior insight that can inform strategic decision making in multiple domains.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit inversion formula for Guillarmou's normal operator on closed surfaces of constant negative curvature. This normal operator can be defined as a weak limit for an "attenuated normal operator", and we prove this inversion formula by first constructing an additional inversion formula for this attenuated normal operator on both the Poincar\'e disk and closed surfaces of constant negative curvature. A consequence of the inversion formula is the explicit construction of invariant distributions with prescribed pushforward over closed hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Using Lavaurs maps and near-parabolic renormalization, we describe the degenerating geometry of external rays for quadratic polynomials when a periodic cycle becomes parabolic. We similarly describe the geometry of parameter rays for the Mandelbrot set near parabolic points. Using this geometric control we establish new bounds on the size of limbs of the Mandelbrot set, providing a quadratic Pommerenke-Levin-Yoccoz inequality in the near-parabolic setting.</description>

      <title>Resonant forms at zero for dissipative Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study resonant differential forms at zero for transitive Anosov flows on $3$-manifolds. We pay particular attention to the dissipative case, that is, Anosov flows that do not preserve an absolutely continuous measure. Such flows have two distinguished Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen $3$-forms, $\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}$, and the cohomology classes $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ (where $X$ is the infinitesimal generator of the flow) play a key role in the determination of the space of resonant $1$-forms. When both classes vanish we associate to the flow a $\textit{helicity}$ that naturally extends the classical notion associated with null-homologous volume preserving flows. We provide a general theory that includes horocyclic invariance of resonant $1$-forms and SRB-measures as well as the local geometry of the maps $X\mapsto [\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]$ near a null-homologous volume preserving flow. Next, we study several relevant classes of examples. Among these are thermostats associated with holomorphic quadratic differentials, giving rise to quasi-Fuchsian flows as introduced by Ghys. For these flows we compute explicitly all resonant $1$-forms at zero, we show that $[\iota_{X}\Omega_{\text{SRB}}^{\pm}]=0$ and give an explicit formula for the helicity. In addition we show that a generic time change of a quasi-Fuchsian flow is semisimple and thus the order of vanishing of the Ruelle zeta function at zero is $-\chi(M)$, the same as in the geodesic flow case. In contrast, we show that if $(M,g)$ is a closed surface of negative curvature, the Gaussian thermostat driven by a (small) harmonic $1$-form has a Ruelle zeta function whose order of vanishing at zero is $-\chi(M)-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14287v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an algebraic formulation of billiards on plane curves over algebraically closed fields, extending Glutsyuk's complex billiards. For any smooth algebraic curve $C$ of degree $d \geq 2$, algebraic billiards is a rational $(d-1)$-to-$(d-1)$ surface correspondence on the space of unit tangent vectors based on $C$. We prove that the dynamical degree of the billiards correspondence is at most an explicit cubic algebraic integer $\rho_d &lt; 2d^2 - d - 3$, depending only on the degree $d$ of $C$. As a corollary, for smooth real algebraic curves, the topological entropy of the classical billiards map is at most $\log \rho_d$. We further show that the billiards correspondence satisfies the singularity confinement property and preserves a natural $2$-form. To prove our bounds, we construct a birational model that partially resolves the indeterminacy of algebraic billiards.</description>

      <title>Branches and bifurcations of ejection-collision orbits in the planar circular restricted three body problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper it to prove existence theorems for one parameter families (branches) of ejection-collision orbits in the planar circular restricted three body problem (CRTBP), and to study some of their bifurcations. The orbits considered are ejected from one primary body and collide with the other (as opposed to more local ejections-collision orbits which involve only a single body). We consider branches which are (i) parameterized by the Jacobi integral (energy like quantity conserved by the CRTBP) and (ii) parameterized by the two body mass ratio when energy is fixed. The method of proof is constructive and computer assisted, hence can be applied in non perturbative settings and (potentially) to other conservative systems of differential equations. The main requirement is that the system should admit a change of coordinates which regularizes the singularities (collisions). In the planar CRTBP the necessary regularization is provided by the classical Levi-Civita transformation.</description>

Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>

We analyse properties of magic billiards in the case of elliptical boundaries. We provide explicit conditions for periodicity in algebro-geometric, analytic, and polynomial forms. A topological description of those billiards is given using Fomenko graphs.</description>

      <title>Topological and dimensional properties of univoque bases in double-base expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two real numbers $q_0,q_1$ with $q_0, q_1 &gt; 1$ satisfying $q_0+q_1 \ge q_0q_1$, we call a sequence $(d_i)$ with $d_i\in \{0,1\}$ a $(q_0,q_1)$-expansion or a double-base expansion of a real number $x$ if
  \[
  x=\mathop{\sum}\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{d_{i}}{q_{d_1}q_{d_2}\cdots q_{d_i}}.
  \]
  When $q_0=q_1=q$, the set of univoque bases is given by the set of $q$'s such that $x = 1$ has exactly one $(q, q)$-expansion. The topological, dimensional and symbolic properties of such sets and their corresponding sequences have been intensively investigated. In our research, we study the topological and dimensional properties of the set of univoque bases for double-base expansions. This problem is more complicated, requiring new research strategies. Several new properties are uncovered. In particular, we show that the set of univoque bases in the double base setting is a meagre set with full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows are all exponentially mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study strong spectral properties of Ruelle transfer operators related to Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows. As a consequence we establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables with respect to any Gibbs measure. The approach invented in 1997 by Dolgopyat, and further developed in our papers in 2011 and 2023, is substantially enhanced here, allowing to deal with the general case of arbitrary contact Anosov flows and arbitrary Gibbs measures. The results obtained here naturally apply to geodesic flows on compact Riemannian manifolds.
  As is now well-known, the strong spectral estimates for Ruelle operators and a well-established technique by Dolgopyat lead to exponential decay of correlations for H\"older continuous potentials. Other immediate consequences are: (a) existence of a non-zero analytic continuation of the Ruelle zeta function with a pole at the entropy in a vertical strip containing the entropy in its interior; (b) a Prime Orbit Theorem with an exponentially small error.</description>

      <title>Besicovitch-weighted ergodic theorems with continuous time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, we show that ergodic flows in the $L^p$-space over a $\sigma$-finite measure space generated by strongly continuous semigroups of Dunford-Schwartz operators and modulated by bounded Besicovitch almost periodic functions converge almost uniformly (in Egorov's sense). The corresponding local ergodic theorem is proved with identification of the limit. Then we extend these results to arbitrary fully symmetric spaces, including Orlicz, Lorentz, and Marcinkiewicz spaces.</description>

      <title>Barcodes as Summary of Loss Function Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to study neural networks' loss surfaces by methods of topological data analysis. We suggest to apply barcodes of Morse complexes to explore topology of loss surfaces. An algorithm for calculations of the loss function's barcodes of local minima is described. We have conducted experiments for calculating barcodes of local minima for benchmark functions and for loss surfaces of small neural networks. Our experiments confirm our two principal observations for neural networks' loss surfaces. First, the barcodes of local minima are located in a small lower part of the range of values of neural networks' loss function. Secondly, increase of the neural network's depth and width lowers the barcodes of local minima. This has some natural implications for the neural network's learning and for its generalization properties.</description>

      <title>Conformal dynamics at infinity for groups with contracting elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04861v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of conformal density at infinity for groups with contracting elements. We start by introducing a class of convergence boundary encompassing many known hyperbolic-like boundaries, on which a detailed study of conical points and Myrberg points is carried out. The basic theory of conformal density is then established on the convergence boundary, including the Sullivan shadow lemma and a Hopf--Tsuji--Sullivan dichotomy. This gives a unification of the theory of conformal density on the Gromov and Floyd boundary for (relatively) hyperbolic groups, the visual boundary for rank-1 CAT(0) groups, and Thurston boundary for mapping class groups. Besides that, the conformal density on the horofunction boundary provides a new important example of our general theory. Applications include the identification of Poisson boundary of random walks, the co-growth problem of divergent groups, measure theoretical results for CAT(0) groups and mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Stability of pullbacks of foliations on weighted projective spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show a stability-type theorem for foliations on projective spaces which arise as pullbacks of foliations with a split tangent sheaf on weighted projective spaces. As a consequence, we will be able to construct many irreducible components of the corresponding spaces of foliations, most of them being previously unknown. This result also provides an alternative and unified proof for the stability of other families of foliations.</description>

      <title>Quantum space-time Poincar\'e inequality for Lindblad dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive Markovian Lindblad dynamics (i.e., quantum Markov semigroups), where the detailed balance is disrupted by a coherent drift term. It is known that the sharp $L^2$-exponential convergence rate of Lindblad dynamics is determined by the spectral gap of the generator. We show that incorporating a Hamiltonian component into a detailed balanced Lindbladian can generically enhance its spectral gap, thereby accelerating the mixing. In addition, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution. However, estimating the spectral gap, particularly for a non-detailed balanced Lindbladian, presents a significant challenge. In the case of hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics, we extend the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics to derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. This analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequality. Furthermore, we provide several examples with connections to quantum noise and quantum Gibbs samplers as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Super-Resolution Diffusion for 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive physics-informed super-resolution diffusion is developed for non-invasive virtual diagnostics of the 6D phase space density of charged particle beams. An adaptive variational autoencoder (VAE) embeds initial beam condition images and scalar measurements to a low-dimensional latent space from which a 326 pixel 6D tensor representation of the beam's 6D phase space density is generated. Projecting from a 6D tensor generates physically consistent 2D projections. Physics-guided super-resolution diffusion transforms low-resolution images of the 6D density to high resolution 256x256 pixel images. Un-supervised adaptive latent space tuning enables tracking of time-varying beams without knowledge of time-varying initial conditions. The method is demonstrated with experimental data and multi-particle simulations at the HiRES UED. The general approach is applicable to a wide range of complex dynamic systems evolving in high-dimensional phase space. The method is shown to be robust to distribution shift without re-training.</description>

      <title>On sparsity of integral points in orbits and correspondences with big pullbacks under iterates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new unconditional results of sparsity of integral points on orbits under many maps and correspondences in arbitrary dimensions, generalizing theorems of Yasufuku(2015) and others. The main ingredients are new diophantine approximation tools and recent constructions for correspondences due to Ingram (2011).</description>
