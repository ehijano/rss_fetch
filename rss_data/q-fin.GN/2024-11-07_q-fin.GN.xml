      <title>Generative AI at Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,172 customer support agents. Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15\% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for relatively rare problems, where human agents have less baseline training and experience. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along two key dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.</description>

      <title>Gas Fees on the Ethereum Blockchain: From Foundations to Derivatives Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gas fee, paid for inclusion in the blockchain, is analyzed in two parts. First, we consider how effort in terms of resources required to process and store a transaction turns into a gas limit, which, through a fee, comprised of the base and priority fee in the current version of Ethereum, is converted into the cost paid by the user. We adhere closely to the Ethereum protocol to simplify the analysis and to constrain the design choices when considering multidimensional gas. Second, we assume that the gas price is given deus ex machina by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and evaluate various derivatives. These contracts can, for example, mitigate gas cost volatility. The ability to price and trade forwards besides the existing spot inclusion into the blockchain could enable users to hedge against future cost fluctuations. Overall, this paper offers a comprehensive analysis of gas fee dynamics on the Ethereum blockchain, integrating supply-side constraints with demand-side modelling to enhance the predictability and stability of transaction costs.</description>
