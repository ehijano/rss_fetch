      <title>MathPartner is a breakthrough technology for natural sciences education, scientic and engineering applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article provides a brief description of the MathPartner service. This freely available cloud-based Mathematics is a universal system for symbolic-numeric calculations. Its Mathpar language is a subset of the LaTeX language, but allows you to create mathematical texts that contain "computable" mathematical operators. This opens up completely new opportunities for improving the educational process for all natural science disciplines, for the use of mathematics in scientific and engineering calculations. To save and freely exchange educational and other texts in the Mathpar language, a GitHub repository has been created. It is concluded that cloud mathematics MathPartner is a new breakthrough technology for school and university natural science education, for scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>KERAIA: An Adaptive and Explainable Framework for Dynamic Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform for symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent challenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic, complex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that motivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be effectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI systems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on foundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while introducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for dynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive inheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and Cloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation paradigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle, ensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of LoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation language, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse inference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility, expressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of multiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics in water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge representation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and knowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational considerations of the KERAIA platform.</description>
