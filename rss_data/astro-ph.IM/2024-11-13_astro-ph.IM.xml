      <title>The Simons Observatory: laboratory beam characterization for the first small aperture telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory is a ground-based telescope array located at an elevation of 5200 meters, in the Atacama Desert in Chile, designed to measure the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background. It comprises four telescopes: three 0.42-meter small aperture telescopes (SATs), focused on searching for primordial gravitational waves, and one 6-meter large aperture telescope, focused on studying small-scale perturbations. Each of the SATs will field over 12,000 TES bolometers, with two SATs sensitive to both 90 and 150GHz frequency bands (SAT-MF1, and SAT-MF2), while the third SAT is sensitive to 220 and 280GHz frequency bands. Prior to its deployment in 2023, the optical properties of SAT-MF1 were characterized in the laboratory. We report on measurements of near-field beam maps acquired using a thermal source along with measurements using a holographic method that enables characterization of the amplitude and phase of the beam response, yielding an estimate of the far-field radiation pattern received by SAT-MF1. We find that the near-field half-width-half-maximum (HWHM) requirements are met across the focal plane array for the 90GHz frequency band, and through most of the focal plane array for the 150GHz frequency band. The mean of the bandpass averaged HWHM of the edge-detector focal plane modules match the simulated HWHM to 10.4%, with the discrepancy caused by fringing in the simulation. The measured beam profiles match simulations to within 2dB from the beam center to at least the -10dB level. Holography estimates of the far-field 90GHz beams match the full-width-half-maximum from simulation within 1%, and the beam profiles deviate by less than 2dB inside the central lobe. The success of the holography and thermal beam map experiments confirmed the optical performance was sufficient to meet the science requirements. On-site observations are currently underway.</description>

      <title>Accelerating radio astronomy imaging with RICK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an implementation of radio astronomy imaging algorithms on modern High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures, exploiting distributed memory parallelism and acceleration throughout multiple GPUs. Our code, called RICK (Radio Imaging Code Kernels), is capable of performing the major steps of the w-stacking algorithm presented in Offringa et al. (2014) both inter- and intra-node, and in particular has the possibility to run entirely on the GPU memory, minimising the number of data transfers between CPU and GPU. This feature, especially among multiple GPUs, is critical given the huge sizes of radio datasets involved. After a detailed description of the new implementations of the code with respect to the first version presented in Gheller et al. (2023), we analyse the performances of the code for each step involved in its execution. We also discuss the pros and cons related to an accelerated approach to this problem and its impact on the overall behaviour of the code. Such approach to the problem results in a significant improvement in terms of runtime with respect to the CPU version of the code, as long as the amount of computational resources does not exceed the one requested by the size of the problem: the code, in fact, is now limited by the communication costs, with the computation that gets heavily reduced by the capabilities of the accelerators.</description>

      <title>Physics of radio antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio antennas are widely used in the field of particle astrophysics in searches for ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and neutrinos (UHEN). It is therefore necessary to properly describe the physics of their response. In this article, we summarize the mathematics underlying parameterizations of radio antennas. As a paradigm, we focus on a half-wave dipole and also discuss measurements of characteristics, performed in an electromagnetic (EM) anechoic chamber.</description>

      <title>Commissioning An All-Sky Infrared Camera Array for Detection Of Airborne Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date there is little publicly available scientific data on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) whose properties and kinematics purportedly reside outside the performance envelope of known phenomena. To address this deficiency, the Galileo Project is designing, building, and commissioning a multi-modal ground-based observatory to continuously monitor the sky and conduct a rigorous long-term aerial census of all aerial phenomena, including natural and human-made. One of the key instruments is an all-sky infrared camera array using eight uncooled long-wave infrared FLIR Boson 640 cameras. Their calibration includes a novel extrinsic calibration method using airplane positions from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We establish a first baseline for the system performance over five months of field operation, using a real-world dataset derived from ADS-B data, synthetic 3-D trajectories, and a hand-labelled real-world dataset. We report acceptance rates (e.g. viewable airplanes that are recorded) and detection efficiencies (e.g. recorded airplanes which are successfully detected) for a variety of weather conditions, range and aircraft size. We reconstruct $\sim$500,000 trajectories of aerial objects from this commissioning period. A toy outlier search focused on large sinuosity of the 2-D reconstructed trajectories flags about 16% of trajectories as outliers. After manual review, 144 trajectories remain ambiguous: they are likely mundane objects but cannot be elucidated at this stage of development without distance and kinematics estimation or other sensor modalities. Our observed count of ambiguous outliers combined with systematic uncertainties yields an upper limit of 18,271 outliers count for the five-month interval at a 95% confidence level. This likelihood-based method to evaluate significance is applicable to all of our future outlier searches.</description>

      <title>Peering into the black box: forward-modeling the uncertainty budget of high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS; R &gt;~ 15,000) is a powerful complement to space-based studies of exoplanet atmospheres. By resolving individual spectral lines, HRCCS can precisely measure chemical abundance ratios, directly constrain atmospheric dynamics, and robustly probe multidimensional physics. But the subtleties of HRCCS datasets -- e.g., the lack of exoplanetary spectra visible by eye and the statistically complex process of telluric removal -- can make interpreting them difficult. In this work, we seek to clarify the uncertainty budget of HRCCS with a forward-modeling approach. We present a HRCCS observation simulator, scope (https://github.com/arjunsavel/scope), that incorporates spectral contributions from the exoplanet, star, tellurics, and instrument. This tool allows us to control the underlying dataset, enabling controlled experimentation with complex HRCCS methods. Simulating a fiducial hot Jupiter dataset (WASP-77Ab emission with IGRINS), we first confirm via multiple tests that the commonly used principal components analysis does not bias the planetary signal when few components are used. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics and moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in HRCCS detection significance. However, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can bias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances. Additionally, in the low-SNR limit, constraints on gas abundances become highly non-Gaussian. Our investigation of the uncertainties and potential biases inherent in HRCCS data analysis enables greater confidence in scientific results from this maturing method.</description>

      <title>PICZL: Image-based Photometric Redshifts for AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing photo-z for AGN is challenging, primarily due to the interplay of relative emissions associated with the SMBH and its host galaxy. SED fitting methods, effective in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in all-sky surveys with fewer bands available, lacking the ability to capture the AGN contribution to the SED accurately. This limitation affects the many 10s of millions of AGN clearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA. Our goal is to significantly enhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while avoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily available data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey for DESI, covering &gt; 20,000 deg$^{2}$ with deep images and catalog-based photometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning algorithm leveraging an ensemble of CNNs. Utilizing a cross-channel approach, the algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained from catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the integration of Gaussian mixture models. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN, PICZL achieves a variance $\sigma_{\textrm{NMAD}}$ of 4.5% with an outlier fraction $\eta$ of 5.6%, outperforming previous attempts to compute accurate photo-z for AGN using ML. We highlight that the model's performance depends on many variables, predominantly the depth of the data. A thorough evaluation of these dependencies is presented in the paper. Our streamlined methodology maintains consistent performance across the entire survey area when accounting for differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep photometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for wide-scale realisation. With this paper, we release updated photo-z (including errors) for the XMM-SERVS W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1 and LSS fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology for Gravitational Wave Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's General Theory of Relativity predicts that accelerating mass distributions produce gravitational radiation, analogous to electromagnetic radiation from accelerating charges. These gravitational waves have not been directly detected to date, but are expected to open a new window to the Universe in the near future. Suitable telescopes are kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance between quasi free-falling mirrors. Recent advances in quantum metrology may now provide the required sensitivity boost. So-called squeezed light is able to quantum entangle the high-power laser fields in the interferometer arms, and could play a key role in the realization of gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>The Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey: X-ray to infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of a representative sample of M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 5-1x10^7 Angstrom spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for twelve M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0-M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The twelve stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra and/or Swift X-ray observations and completed with various model data, including Lyman alpha reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models and Differential Emission Measure models in the currently-unobservable Extreme Ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST High-Level Science Products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the FUV/NUV ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M\,dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.</description>

      <title>Beam quality $M^2(\psi)$ factor, spot rotation angle, and angular speed in general laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unified definition for the rotation angle and rotation angular speed of general beams, including those with orbital angular momentum (OAM), has been lacking until now. The rotation of a general beam is characterized by observing the rotational behavior of the directions of the extreme spot sizes during propagation. We introduce the beam quality $M^2(\psi)$ factor to characterize the unique beam quality of a general beam across all directions, not limited to the $x$- or $y$-axes. Besides that, we present the beam center $s_{\psi}(\psi,z)$, spot size $w_{\psi}(\psi,z)$, waist position, waist radius, and divergence angle along the direction that forms an angle $\psi$ with the $x$-axis in the plane perpendicular to the $z$-axis for the general beam. Furthermore, this paper presents rapid calculation formulas for these parameters, utilizing the mode expansion method (MEM). Subsequently, we prove that only two extreme spot sizes exist in a given detection plane and the angle between the maximum and minimum spot angles is consistently $90^{\circ}$ during the propagation. We also prove the spot rotation angles converge as $z$ approaches either positive or negative infinity. We first show the extreme spot sizes, spot rotation angle, and angular speed for the vortex beam. Our formulas efficiently differentiate between vortex OAM beams and asymmetry OAM beams.</description>

      <title>MUltiplexed Survey Telescope: Perspectives for Large-Scale Structure Cosmology in the Era of Stage-V Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST) is a 6.5-meter telescope under development. Dedicated to highly-multiplexed, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, MUST observes over 20,000 targets simultaneously using 6.2-mm pitch positioning robots within a ~5 deg2 field of view. MUST aims to carry out the first Stage-V spectroscopic survey in the 2030s to map the 3D Universe with over 100 million galaxies and quasars, spanning from the nearby Universe to redshift z~5.5, corresponding to around 1 billion years after the Big Bang. To cover this extensive redshift range, we present an initial conceptual target selection algorithm for different types of galaxies, from local bright galaxies, luminous red galaxies, and emission line galaxies to high-redshift (2 &lt; z &lt; 5.5) Lyman-break galaxies. Using Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that MUST can address fundamental questions in cosmology, including the nature of dark energy, test of gravity theories, and investigations into primordial physics. This is the first paper in the series of science white papers for MUST, with subsequent developments focusing on additional scientific cases such as galaxy and quasar evolution, Milky Way physics, and dynamic phenomena in the time-domain Universe.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Scale Multi-Phase Circumgalactic Medium: Observed and Simulated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are exciting times for studies of galaxy formation and the growth of structures. New observatories and advanced simulations are revolutionising our understanding of the cycling of matter into, through, and out of galaxies. This chapter first describes why baryons are essential for galaxy evolution, providing a key test of Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. In particular, we describe a basic framework to convert measurements of the gas properties observed in absorption spectra into global estimates of the condensed (stars and cold gas) matter mass densities. We then review our current understanding of the cycling of baryons from global to galactic scales, in the so-called circumgalactic medium. The final sections are dedicated to future prospects, identifying new techniques and up-coming facilities as well as key open questions. This chapter is complemented with a series of hands-on exercises which provide a practical guide to using publicly available hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Beyond providing a direct connection between new observations and advanced simulations, these exercises give the reader the necessary tools to make use of these theoretical models to address their own science questions. Ultimately, our increasingly accurate description of the circumgalactic medium reveals its crucial role in transforming the pristine early Universe into the rich and diverse Universe of the present day.</description>

Abstract: Xenoscope is a demonstrator for a next-generation xenon-based observatory for astroparticle physics, as proposed by the XLZD (XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN) collaboration. It houses a 2.6 m tall, two-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC), in a cryostat filled with $\sim$ 360 kg of liquid xenon. The main goals of the facility are to demonstrate electron drift in liquid xenon over this distance, to measure the electron cloud transversal and longitudinal diffusion, as well as the optical properties of the medium. In this work, we describe in detail the construction and commissioning of the TPC and report on the observation of light and charge signals with cosmic muons.</description>

      <title>Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at Gemini-South: Instrument performance and integration, first science, and next steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gemini South telescope is now equipped with a new high-resolution spectrograph called GHOST (the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph). This instrument provides high-efficiency, high-resolution spectra covering 347-1060 nm in a single exposure of either one or two targets simultaneously, along with precision radial velocity spectroscopy utilizing an internal calibration source. It can operate at a spectral element resolving power of either 76000 or 56000, and can reach a SNR$\sim$5 in a 1hr exposure on a V$\sim$20.8 mag target in median site seeing, and dark skies (per resolution element). GHOST was installed on-site in June 2022, and we report performance after full integration to queue operations in November 2023, in addition to scientific results enabled by the integration observing runs. These results demonstrate the ability to observe a wide variety of bright and faint targets with high efficiency and precision. With GHOST, new avenues to explore high-resolution spectroscopy have opened up to the astronomical community. These are described, along with the planned and potential upgrades to the instrument.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Super-resolution of Cosmological Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully employed for augmenting low-resolution cosmological simulations with small-scale information, a task known as "super-resolution". So far, these cosmological super-resolution models have relied on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can achieve highly realistic results, but suffer from various shortcomings (e.g. low sample diversity). We introduce denoising diffusion models as a powerful generative model for super-resolving cosmic large-scale structure predictions (as a first proof-of-concept in two dimensions). To obtain accurate results down to small scales, we develop a new "filter-boosted" training approach that redistributes the importance of different scales in the pixel-wise training objective. We demonstrate that our model not only produces convincing super-resolution images and power spectra consistent at the percent level, but is also able to reproduce the diversity of small-scale features consistent with a given low-resolution simulation. This enables uncertainty quantification for the generated small-scale features, which is critical for the usefulness of such super-resolution models as a viable surrogate model for cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>A Cohesive Deep Drilling Field Strategy for LSST Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will image billions of astronomical objects in the wide-fast-deep primary survey and in a set of minisurveys including intensive observations of a group of deep drilling fields (DDFs). The DDFs are a critical piece of three key aspects of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) cosmological measurements: they provide a required calibration for photometric redshifts and weak gravitational lensing measurements and they directly contribute to cosmological constraints from the most distant type Ia supernovae. We present a set of cohesive DDF strategies fulfilling science requirements relevant to DESC and following the guidelines of the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee. We propose a method to estimate the observing strategy parameters and we perform simulations of the corresponding surveys. We define a set of metrics for each of the science case to assess the performance of the proposed observing strategies. We show that the most promising results are achieved with deep rolling surveys characterized by two sets of fields: ultradeep fields (z&lt;1.1) observed at a high cadence with a large number of visits over a limited number of seasons; deep fields (z&lt;0.7), observed with a cadence of ~3 nights for ten years. These encouraging results should be confirmed with realistic simulations using the LSST scheduler. A DDF budget of ~8.5% is required to design observing strategies satisfying all the cosmological requirements. A lower DDF budget lead to surveys that either do not fulfill photo-z/WL requirements or are not optimal for SNe Ia cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>
