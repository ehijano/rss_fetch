      <title>Certifying Guidance &amp; Control Networks: Uncertainty Propagation to an Event Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform uncertainty propagation on an event manifold for Guidance &amp; Control Networks (G&amp;CNETs), aiming to enhance the certification tools for neural networks in this field. This work utilizes three previously solved optimal control problems with varying levels of dynamics nonlinearity and event manifold complexity. The G&amp;CNETs are trained to represent the optimal control policies of a time-optimal interplanetary transfer, a mass-optimal landing on an asteroid and energy-optimal drone racing, respectively. For each of these problems, we describe analytically the terminal conditions on an event manifold with respect to initial state uncertainties. Crucially, this expansion does not depend on time but solely on the initial conditions of the system, thereby making it possible to study the robustness of the G&amp;CNET at any specific stage of a mission defined by the event manifold. Once this analytical expression is found, we provide confidence bounds by applying the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem and perform uncertainty propagation using moment generating functions. While Monte Carlo-based (MC) methods can yield the results we present, this work is driven by the recognition that MC simulations alone may be insufficient for future certification of neural networks in guidance and control applications.</description>

      <title>Towards a Deeper Understanding of Transformer for Residential Non-intrusive Load Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) applications in recent years. Despite their success, existing studies have not thoroughly examined the impact of various hyper-parameters on model performance, which is crucial for advancing high-performing transformer models. In this work, a comprehensive series of experiments have been conducted to analyze the influence of these hyper-parameters in the context of residential NILM. This study delves into the effects of the number of hidden dimensions in the attention layer, the number of attention layers, the number of attention heads, and the dropout ratio on transformer performance. Furthermore, the role of the masking ratio has explored in BERT-style transformer training, providing a detailed investigation into its impact on NILM tasks. Based on these experiments, the optimal hyper-parameters have been selected and used them to train a transformer model, which surpasses the performance of existing models. The experimental findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing transformer architectures, aiming to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency in NILM applications. It is expected that this work will serve as a foundation for future research and development of more robust and capable transformer models for NILM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the sim-to-real capabilities of retrospective cost optimization-based adaptive control for multirotor stabilization and trajectory-tracking problems. First, a continuous-time version of the widely used discrete-time retrospective control adaptive control algorithm is developed. Next, a computationally inexpensive 12-degree-of-freedom model of a multirotor is used to learn the control system in a simulation environment with a single trajectory. Finally, the performance of the learned controller is verified in a complex and realistic multirotor model in simulation and with a physical quadcopter in a waypoint command and a helical trajectory command.</description>

      <title>Universal Global State Estimation for Inertial Navigation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurate pose estimation (position, velocity, and orientation) for a rigid body. By utilizing generic exteroceptive measurements in combination with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we reformulate the vehicle's dynamics and outputs to fit within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework. This transformation enables the application of a linear continuous-time Kalman filter, thereby avoiding the complexities of nonlinear estimators and local Kalman-type filtering methods (e.g., EKF). We perform a complete uniform observability analysis for key benchmark problems (e.g., GPS-INS and Landmark-INS) and derive sufficient conditions for ensuring global uniform exponential stability. Simulations are conducted for two practical applications: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) with both constant and time-varying gains, as well as GPS-aided INS. The proposed approach notably simplifies observer design for INS.</description>

      <title>Safe Reference Tracking and Collision Avoidance for Taxiing Aircraft Using an MPC-CBF Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a framework for the automatic taxiing of aircraft between hangar and take-off given a graph-based model of an airport. We implement a high-level path-planning algorithm that models taxiway intersections as nodes in an undirected graph, algorithmically constructs a directed graph according to the physical limitations of the aircraft, and finds the shortest valid taxi path through the directed graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. We then use this shortest path to construct a reference trajectory for the aircraft to follow that considers the turning capabilities of a given aircraft. Using high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), we construct safety conditions for multi-obstacle avoidance and safe reference tracking for simple 2D unicycle dynamics with acceleration control inputs. We then use these safety conditions to design an MPC-CBF framework that tracks the reference trajectory while adhering to the safety constraints. We compare the performance of our MPC-CBF controller with a PID-CBF control method via simulations.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-Based Reference Governor for Nonlinear Systems With Application to Automotive Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction-based nonlinear reference governor (PRG) is an add-on algorithm to enforce constraints on pre-stabilized nonlinear systems by modifying, whenever necessary, the reference signal. The implementation of PRG carries a heavy computational burden, as it may require multiple numerical simulations of the plant model at each sample time. To this end, this paper proposes an alternative approach based on machine learning, where we first use a regression neural network (NN) to approximate the input-output map of the PRG from a set of training data. During the real-time operation, at each sample time, we use the trained NN to compute a nominal reference command, which may not be constraint admissible due to training errors and limited data. We adopt a novel sensitivity-based approach to minimally adjust the nominal reference while ensuring constraint enforcement. We thus refer to the resulting control strategy as the modified neural network reference governor (MNN-RG), which is significantly more computationally efficient than the PRG. The computational and theoretical properties of MNN-RG are presented. Finally, the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method are studied by applying it as a load governor for constraint management in automotive fuel cell systems through simulation-based case studies.</description>

      <title>Smart Air Quality Monitoring for Automotive Workshop Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air quality monitoring in automotive workshops is crucial for occupational health and regulatory compliance. This study presents the development of an environmental monitoring system based on Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. DHT-11 and MQ-135 sensors were employed to measure temperature, humidity, and toxic gas concentrations, with real-time data transmission to the ThingSpeak platform via the MQTT protocol. Machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM, were applied to analyze the data and compute an air salubrity index based on Gaussian functions. The system proved effective in detecting pollutant peaks and issuing automatic alerts, significantly improving worker health and safety. Workshops that implemented the system reported greater regulatory compliance and reduced occupational risks. The study concludes that the combination of IoT and AI provides an efficient and replicable solution for environmental monitoring in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Compositional Planning for Logically Constrained Multi-Agent Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing control policies for large, distributed systems is challenging, especially in the context of critical, temporal logic based specifications (e.g., safety) that must be met with high probability. Compositional methods for such problems are needed for scalability, yet relying on worst-case assumptions for decomposition tends to be overly conservative. In this work, we use the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) to provide an assume-guarantee based decomposition for synthesizing decentralized control policies, subject to logical constraints in a multi-agent setting. The returned policies are guaranteed to satisfy the constraints with high probability and provide a lower bound on the achieved objective reward. We empirically find the returned policies to achieve near-optimal rewards while enjoying an order of magnitude reduction in problem size and execution time.</description>

      <title>Trajectory elongation strategies with minimum curvature discontinuities for a Dubins vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present strategies for designing curvature-bounded trajectories of any desired length between any two given oriented points. The proposed trajectory is constructed by the concatenation of three circular arcs of varying radii. Such a trajectory guarantees a complete coverage of the maximum set of reachable lengths while minimising the number of changeover points in the trajectory to a maximum of two under all scenarios. Additionally, by using the notion of internally tangent circles, we expand the set of Circle-Circle-Circle trajectories to eight kinds, consisting of {LLL, LLR, LRR, LRL, RRL, RLL, RLR, RRR} paths. The paper presents a mathematical formulation of the proposed trajectory and the conditions for the existence and classification of each kind of trajectory. We also analyse the variation of the length of the trajectory using suitable elongation strategies and derive the set of reachable lengths for all pairs of oriented points. Finally, the results of this paper are illustrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Optimization Method for Real-Time Parameterization of PV-Farm Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models of physical systems. This paper details a novel two-stage optimization method for real-time parameterization of photovoltaic digital twins (PVDTs) using field measurements. Initially, the method estimates equivalent irradiance from PV power, voltage, and current data, eliminating the need for direct irradiance sensors. This is crucial for tuning the DT's parameters to actual environmental conditions, thereby improving power prediction accuracy. The second stage focuses on refining these parameters by minimizing discrepancies between measured and predicted outputs. This optimization utilizes the estimated equivalent irradiance as a model input, maintaining synchronization with real-world conditions. Parameter updates are event-trigger, launched when deviations exceed predefined thresholds. This strategy optimizes prediction accuracy and manages communication loads efficiently. Validated with extensive data from a PV farm, this approach outperforms existing methodologies in predictive accuracy and operational efficiency, significantly improving the performance DTs in real-time grid operations.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Equitable Energy Access in Energy Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of equitable energy access within an energy community consisting of members with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, including varying income levels and differing capacities to access distributed energy resources such as solar power and storage systems. While optimal energy consumption scheduling is well-studied, integrating equity into decentralized real-time energy access remains under-explored. This paper formulates Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM)--a welfare optimization energy scheduling subject to equity constraints. We further develop a decentralized implementation (D-EqWM) as a bi-level optimization, where a non-profit operator designs a community pricing policy aimed at maximizing overall welfare, subject to constraints that ensure equitable access. Community members, in turn, optimize their individual consumption based on these prices. We present the optimal pricing policy along with its key properties.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Under Frequency Load Shedding Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) is a critical control strategy in power systems aimed at maintaining system stability and preventing blackouts during severe frequency drops. Traditional UFLS schemes often rely on predefined rules and thresholds, which may not adapt effectively to the dynamic and complex nature of modern power grids. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been proposed to effectively handle the UFLS problem. However, training these RL agents is computationally burdensome due to solving multiple differential equations at each step of training. This computational burden also limits the effectiveness of the RL agents for use in real-time. To reduce the computational burden, a machine learning (ML) classifier is trained to capture the frequency response of the system to various disturbances. The RL agent is then trained using the classifier, thus avoiding multiple computations during each step of agent training. Key features of this approach include reduced training time, as well as faster real-time application compared to other RL agents, and its potential to improve system resilience by minimizing the amount of load shed while effectively stabilizing the frequency. Comparative studies with conventional UFLS schemes demonstrate that the RL-based strategy achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the time required. Simulation results on the IEEE 68-bus system validate the performance of the proposed RL method.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Engine with Reduced Action and State Space for Scalable Cyber-Physical Optimal Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous research studies have been conducted to enhance the resilience of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by detecting potential cyber or physical disturbances. However, the development of scalable and optimal response measures under power system contingency based on fusing cyber-physical data is still in an early stage. To address this research gap, this paper introduces a power system response engine based on reinforcement learning (RL) and role and interaction discovery (RID) techniques. RL-RID-GridResponder is designed to automatically detect the contingency and assist with the decision-making process to ensure optimal power system operation. The RL-RID-GridResponder learns via an RL-based structure and achieves enhanced scalability by integrating an RID module with reduced action and state spaces. The applicability of RL-RID-GridResponder in providing scalable and optimal responses for CPSs is demonstrated on power systems in the context of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Moreover, simulations are conducted on a Volt-Var regulation problem using the augmented WSCC 9-bus and augmented IEEE 24-bus systems based on fused cyber and physical data sets. The results show that the proposed RL-RID-GridResponder can provide fast and accurate responses to ensure optimal power system operation under DoS and can extend to other system contingencies such as line outages and loss of loads.</description>

      <title>Distribution Grids May Be a Barrier To Residential Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric alternatives can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in many settings. However, residential electrification can raise electricity demand beyond the safe limits of electrical infrastructure, increasing the risk of blackouts or requiring grid reinforcement that can be slow and expensive. Here, we estimate the physical and economic impacts on distribution grids of electrifying all housing and personal vehicles in each county of the lower 48 United States. We find that space heating is the main driver of grid impacts, with the coldest regions seeing demand peaks up to three times higher than today's peaks. Accommodating electrification of all housing and personal vehicles could require up to 312 GW of distribution grid reinforcement nationally, at a cost of $183 to $415 billion, or $1,500 to $3,400 per household (95% confidence intervals). However, demand-side management can mitigate demand peaks, reducing grid reinforcement costs by up to 92%.</description>

      <title>Distributed ADMM Approach for the Power Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical network reconfiguration problem aims to minimize losses in a distribution system by adjusting switches while ensuring radial topology. The growing use of renewable energy and the complexity of managing modern power grids make solving the reconfiguration problem crucial. Distributed algorithms help optimize grid configurations, ensuring efficient adaptation to changing conditions and better utilization of renewable energy sources. This paper introduces a distributed algorithm designed to tackle the problem of power distribution network reconfiguration with a radiality constraint. This algorithm relies on ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), where each agent progressively updates its estimation based on the information exchanged with neighboring agents. We show that every agent is required to solve a linearly constrained convex quadratic programming problem and a Minimum Weight Rooted Arborescence Problem (MWRAP) with local weights during each iteration. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios, including its application to a 33-bus test system and a real-world network.</description>

      <title>Path Planning and Robust Path Tracking Control of an Automated Parallel Parking Maneuver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self driving vehicles should be able to perform parallel parking or a similar maneuver successfully. With this motivation, the S shaped maneuverability test of the Ohio driver license examination is chosen here for automatic execution by a self driving vehicle with drive by wire capability and longitudinal and lateral controls. The Ohio maneuverability test requires the driver to start within an area enclosed by four pylons and the driver is asked to go to the left of the fifth pylon directly in front of the vehicle in a smooth and continuous manner while ending in a parallel direction to the initial one. The driver is then asked to go backwards to the starting location of the vehicle without stopping the vehicle or hitting the pylons. As a self driving vehicle should do a much better job repeatably than a driver, a high order polynomial path model is built along with speed profiling to start and stop smoothly at the ends of the path without large longitudinal and lateral accelerations. In contrast to the long horizon, higher speed path planning and path tracking control applications in the literature, this paper treats low speed and very short horizon path planning and path tracking control with stopping and direction reversal. The path is constructed using a segmented polynomial fit optimization routine that guarantees path curvature smoothness. A linear path tracking model is utilized as the basis of the designed control system consisting of a disturbance observer based curvature rejection filter and a speed scheduled, parameter space robust PID controller. Simulation studies indicate that it has better performance compared to other common control systems such as standalone PID controller and combined PID and feedforward control. indicate that it has better performance compared to other common control systems such as standalone PID controller and combined PID and feedforward control.</description>

      <title>Transient-Safe and Attack-Resilient Secondary Control in AC Microgrids Under Polynomially Unbounded FDI Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel, fully distributed, transient-safe resilient secondary control strategies for AC microgrids, addressing unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks on control input channels. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on steady-state convergence, our approach guarantees transient safety, ensuring that system states remain within predefined safety bounds even during attack initiation a critical aspect overlooked in prior research. Given the reduction of network inertia by increasing the penetration of inverted-based renewables, large overshooting and intense fluctuations are more likely to occur during transients caused by disturbances and cyber-attacks. To mitigate these risks, the proposed control method enhances defense capabilities against polynomially unbounded FDI attacks, maintaining safe system trajectories for both frequency and voltage throughout the transient response. Through rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis, we formally certify the strategies to achieve uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence in frequency and voltage regulation, and active power sharing across multi-inverter-based AC microgrids. Numerical simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols, demonstrating improved system reliability, safety and resilience under adverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Smart energy management: process structure-based hybrid neural networks for optimal scheduling and economic predictive control in integrated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated energy systems (IESs) are complex systems consisting of diverse operating units spanning multiple domains. To address its operational challenges, we propose a physics-informed hybrid time-series neural network (NN) surrogate to predict the dynamic performance of IESs across multiple time scales. This neural network-based modeling approach develops time-series multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for the operating units and integrates them with prior process knowledge about system structure and fundamental dynamics. This integration forms three hybrid NNs (long-term, slow, and fast MLPs) that predict the entire system dynamics across multiple time scales. Leveraging these MLPs, we design an NN-based scheduler and an NN-based economic model predictive control (NEMPC) framework to meet global operational requirements: rapid electrical power responsiveness to operators requests, adequate cooling supply to customers, and increased system profitability, while addressing the dynamic time-scale multiplicity present in IESs. The proposed day-ahead scheduler is formulated using the ReLU network-based MLP, which effectively represents IES performance under a broad range of conditions from a long-term perspective. The scheduler is then exactly recast into a mixed-integer linear programming problem for efficient evaluation. The real-time NEMPC, based on slow and fast MLPs, comprises two sequential distributed control agents: a slow NEMPC for the cooling-dominant subsystem with slower transient responses and a fast NEMPC for the power-dominant subsystem with faster responses. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the developed scheduler and NEMPC schemes outperform their respective benchmark scheduler and controller by about 25% and 40%. Together, they enhance overall system performance by over 70% compared to benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed GNN for non-linear constrained optimization: PINCO a solver for the AC-optimal power flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy transition is driving the integration of large shares of intermittent power sources in the electric power grid. Therefore, addressing the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) effectively becomes increasingly essential. The AC-OPF, which is a fundamental optimization problem in power systems, must be solved more frequently to ensure the safe and cost-effective operation of power systems. Due to its non-linear nature, AC-OPF is often solved in its linearized form, despite inherent inaccuracies. Non-linear solvers, such as the interior point method, are typically employed to solve the full OPF problem. However, these iterative methods may not converge for large systems and do not guarantee global optimality. This work explores a physics-informed graph neural network, PINCO, to solve the AC-OPF. We demonstrate that this method provides accurate solutions in a fraction of the computational time when compared to the established non-linear programming solvers. Remarkably, PINCO generalizes effectively across a diverse set of loading conditions in the power system. We show that our method can solve the AC-OPF without violating inequality constraints. Furthermore, it can function both as a solver and as a hybrid universal function approximator. Moreover, the approach can be easily adapted to different power systems with minimal adjustments to the hyperparameters, including systems with multiple generators at each bus. Overall, this work demonstrates an advancement in the field of power system optimization to tackle the challenges of the energy transition.

      <title>An Optimized H5 Hysteresis Current Control with Clamped Diodes in Transformer-less Grid-PV Inverter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of renewable energy penetration in the grid, photovoltaic (PV) panels are connected to the grid via inverters to supply solar energy. Transformer-less grid-tied PV inverters are gaining popularity because of their improved efficiency, reduced size, and lower costs. However, they can induce a path for leakage currents between the PV and the grid part due to the absence of galvanic isolation between them. This leads to serious electromagnetic interference, loss in efficiency and safety concerns. The leakage current is primarily influenced by the nature of the common mode voltage (CMV), which is determined by the switching techniques of the inverter. In this paper, a novel inverter topology of Hysteresis Controlled H5 with Two Clamping Diodes (HCH5-D2) has been derived. The HCH5-D2 topology helps to decouple the AC part (Grid) and DC part (PV) during the freewheeling to make the CMV constant and in turn, reduces the leakage current. Also, the additional diodes help to reduce the voltage spikes generated during the freewheeling period and maintain the CMV at a constant value. Finally, a 2.2kW grid-connected single-phase HCH5-D2 PV inverter system's MATLAB simulation has been presented with better results when compared with a traditional H4 inverter.</description>

      <title>State Observer for the Fourth-order Model of a Salient Pole Synchronous Generator with Stator Losses: Known and Partially Unknown Input Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the question of how to reconstruct the state of a power system using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). In our previous research we proved that this question has an affirmative answer imposing some rather strict structural assumptions: namely, neglecting the generator rotors saliency and assuming that the stator resistance of the synchronous generator is zero. It was shown in simulations that the performance of the proposed observer was sensitive to these assumptions, observing a transient quality degradation for realistic simulations not imposing these assumptions. Moreover, it was assumed in our previous work that the mechanical power and the field voltage are available for measurement, a scenario that it is not always realistic. In this paper we accomplish two ambitious objectives. First, we propose a new observer that does not impose the simplifying assumptions on the generator model. Secondly, we consider the more realistic scenario where only mechanical power is available for measurement. That is, we solve a problem of state reconstruction of a nonlinear system with partially known input measurements -- that is well-known to be a very challenging task. The design of the first observer relies on two recent developments proposed by the authors, a parameter estimation based approach to the problem of state estimation and the use of the Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing (DREM) technique to estimate these parameters. The use of DREM allows us to overcome the problem of lack of persistent excitation that stymies the application of standard parameter estimation designs. On the other hand, the observer for the partial input measurement scenario relies on the clever exploitation of the systems model. Simulation results illustrates the good performance of the proposed observers.</description>

      <title>Safe Learning-Based Optimization of Model Predictive Control: Application to Battery Fast-Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling complex nonlinear systems under constraints, but often struggles with model uncertainties and the design of suitable cost functions. To address these challenges, we discuss an approach that integrates MPC with safe Bayesian optimization to optimize long-term closed-loop performance despite significant model-plant mismatches. By parameterizing the MPC stage cost function using a radial basis function network, we employ Bayesian optimization as a multi-episode learning strategy to tune the controller without relying on precise system models. This method mitigates conservativeness introduced by overly cautious soft constraints in the MPC cost function and provides probabilistic safety guarantees during learning, ensuring that safety-critical constraints are met with high probability. As a practical application, we apply our approach to fast charging of lithium-ion batteries, a challenging task due to the complicated battery dynamics and strict safety requirements, subject to the requirement to be implementable in real time. Simulation results demonstrate that, in the context of model-plant mismatch, our method reduces charging times compared to traditional MPC methods while maintaining safety. This work extends previous research by emphasizing closed-loop constraint satisfaction and offers a promising solution for enhancing performance in systems where model uncertainties and safety are critical concerns.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel frequency-based data-driven controller for adaptive optics, using power spectral density for optimization while ensuring stability criteria. It addresses disturbance rejection, command amplitude constraints and system transfer functions through convex optimization to obtain an optimal control in an infinite input response filter form. Evaluated within the SAXO+ project, it demonstrates efficacy under diverse atmospheric conditions and operational scenarios.

      <title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Approach for Adaptive Resource Optimization in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wireless networks grow to support more complex applications, the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its smart RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, becomes a crucial solution for real-time network data collection, analysis, and dynamic management of network resources including radio resource blocks and downlink power allocation. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), O-RAN addresses the variable demands of modern networks with unprecedented efficiency and adaptability. Despite progress in using ML-based strategies for network optimization, challenges remain, particularly in the dynamic allocation of resources in unpredictable environments. This paper proposes a novel Meta Deep Reinforcement Learning (Meta-DRL) strategy, inspired by Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), to advance resource block and downlink power allocation in O-RAN. Our approach leverages O-RAN's disaggregated architecture with virtual distributed units (DUs) and meta-DRL strategies, enabling adaptive and localized decision-making that significantly enhances network efficiency. By integrating meta-learning, our system quickly adapts to new network conditions, optimizing resource allocation in real-time. This results in a 19.8% improvement in network management performance over traditional methods, advancing the capabilities of next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Real-World Data and Calibrated Simulation Suite for Offline Training of Reinforcement Learning Agents to Optimize Energy and Emission in Buildings for Environmental Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial office buildings contribute 17 percent of Carbon Emissions in the US, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), and improving their efficiency will reduce their environmental burden and operating cost. A major contributor of energy consumption in these buildings are the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) devices. HVAC devices form a complex and interconnected thermodynamic system with the building and outside weather conditions, and current setpoint control policies are not fully optimized for minimizing energy use and carbon emission. Given a suitable training environment, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent is able to improve upon these policies, but training such a model, especially in a way that scales to thousands of buildings, presents many practical challenges. Most existing work on applying RL to this important task either makes use of proprietary data, or focuses on expensive and proprietary simulations that may not be grounded in the real world. We present the Smart Buildings Control Suite, the first open source interactive HVAC control dataset extracted from live sensor measurements of devices in real office buildings. The dataset consists of two components: six years of real-world historical data from three buildings, for offline RL, and a lightweight interactive simulator for each of these buildings, calibrated using the historical data, for online and model-based RL. For ease of use, our RL environments are all compatible with the OpenAI gym environment standard. We also demonstrate a novel method of calibrating the simulator, as well as baseline results on training an RL agent on the simulator, predicting real-world data, and training an RL agent directly from data. We believe this benchmark will accelerate progress and collaboration on building optimization and environmental sustainability research.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Digital Twin for Human-Centric and Integrated Lighting Asset Management in Public Libraries: From Corrective to Predictive Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lighting asset management in public libraries has traditionally been reactive, focusing on corrective maintenance, addressing issues only when failures occur. Although standards now encourage preventive measures, such as incorporating a maintenance factor, the broader goal of human centric, sustainable lighting systems requires a shift toward predictive maintenance strategies. This study introduces an enhanced digital twin model designed for the proactive management of lighting assets in public libraries. By integrating descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, the model enables a comprehensive, multilevel view of asset health. The proposed framework supports both preventive and predictive maintenance strategies, allowing for early detection of issues and the timely resolution of potential failures. In addition to the specific application for lighting systems, the design is adaptable for other building assets, providing a scalable solution for integrated asset management in various public spaces.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safety-Critical Formation Control with Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores a collaborative method for ensuring safety in multi-agent formation control problems. We formulate a control barrier function (CBF) based safety filter control law for a generic distributed formation controller and extend our previously developed collaborative safety framework to an obstacle avoidance problem for agents with acceleration control inputs. We then incorporate multi-obstacle collision avoidance into the collaborative safety framework. This framework includes a method for computing the maximum capability of agents to satisfy their individual safety requirements. We analyze the convergence rate of our collaborative safety algorithm, and prove the linear-time convergence of cooperating agents to a jointly feasible safe action for all agents under the special case of a tree-structured communication network with a single obstacle for each agent. We illustrate the analytical results via simulation on a mass-spring kinematics-based formation controller and demonstrate the finite-time convergence of the collaborative safety algorithm in the simple proven case, the more general case of a fully-connected system with multiple static obstacles, and with dynamic obstacles.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes an Online Control-Informed Learning (OCIL) framework, which synthesizes the well-established control theories to solve a broad class of learning and control tasks in real time. This novel integration effectively handles practical issues in machine learning such as noisy measurement data, online learning, and data efficiency. By considering any robot as a tunable optimal control system, we propose an online parameter estimator based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) to incrementally tune the system in real time, enabling it to complete designated learning or control tasks. The proposed method also improves robustness in learning by effectively managing noise in the data. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the convergence and regret of OCIL. Three learning modes of OCIL, i.e. Online Imitation Learning, Online System Identification, and Policy Tuning On-the-fly, are investigated via experiments, which validate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Kalman Filter Applied To A Differential Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents the study of the problem of location and trajectory that a robot must follow. It focuses on applying the Kalman filter to achieve location and trajectory estimation in an autonomous mobile differential robot. The experimental data was carried out through tests obtained with the help of two incremental encoders that are part of the construction of the differential robot. The data transmission is carried out from a PC where the control is carried out with the Matlab/Simulink software. The results are expressed in graphs showing the path followed by the robot using PI control, the estimator of the Kalman filter in a real system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project focuses on the design and construction of a prototype mouse based on the Arduino platform, intended for individuals without upper limbs to use computers more effectively. The prototype comprises a microcontroller responsible for processing signals from the MPU-6050 sensor, used as a reference for cursor position, and foot-operated buttons for right and left-click functions. Its design enables cursor control through head movements, providing users with an easy and intuitive way to interact with the computer's graphical interface.

      <title>Compositional Diffusion Models for Powered Descent Trajectory Generation with Flexible Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces TrajDiffuser, a compositional diffusion-based flexible and concurrent trajectory generator for 6 degrees of freedom powered descent guidance. TrajDiffuser is a statistical model that learns the multi-modal distributions of a dataset of simulated optimal trajectories, each subject to only one or few constraints that may vary for different trajectories. During inference, the trajectory is generated simultaneously over time, providing stable long-horizon planning, and constraints can be composed together, increasing the model's generalizability and decreasing the training data required. The generated trajectory is then used to initialize an optimizer, increasing its robustness and speed.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment Method for ADAS and Connected and Automated Driving Function Development/Demonstration/Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current approach for new Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and Connected and Automated Driving (CAD) function development involves a significant amount of public road testing which is inefficient due to the number miles that need to be driven for rare and extreme events to take place, thereby being very costly also, and unsafe as the rest of the road users become involuntary test subjects. A new development, evaluation and demonstration method for safe, efficient, and repeatable development, demonstration and evaluation of ADAS and CAD functions called VehicleInVirtualEnvironment (VVE) was recently introduced as a solution to this problem. The vehicle is operated in a large, empty, and flat area during VVE while its localization and perception sensor data is fed from the virtual environment with other traffic and rare and extreme events being generated as needed. The virtual environment can be easily configured and modified to construct different testing scenarios on demand. This paper focuses on the VVE approach and introduces the coordinate transformations needed to sync pose (location and orientation) in the virtual and physical worlds and handling of localization and perception sensor data using the highly realistic 3D simulation model of a recent autonomous shuttle deployment site in Columbus, Ohio as the virtual world. As a further example that uses multiple actors, the use of VVE for VehicleToVRU communication based Vulnerable Road User (VRU) safety is presented in the paper using VVE experiments and real pedestrian(s) in a safe and repeatable manner. VVE experiments are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Attribute Auctions for Efficient Operation of Non-Cooperative Relaying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of a multi-attribute auction in a communication system to bring about efficient relaying in a non-cooperative setting. We consider a system where a source seeks to offload data to an access point (AP) while balancing both the timeliness and energy-efficiency of the transmission. A deep fade in the communication channel (due to, e.g., a line-of-sight blockage) makes direct communication costly, and the source may alternatively rely on non-cooperative UEs to act as relays. We propose a multi-attribute auction to select a UE and to determine the duration and power of the transmission, with payments to the UE taking the form of energy sent via wireless power transfer (WPT). The quality of the channel from a UE to the AP constitutes private information, and bids consist of a transmission time and transmission power. We show that under a second-preferred-offer auction, truthful bidding by all candidate UEs forms a Nash Equilibrium. However, this auction is not incentive compatible, and we present a modified auction in which truthful bidding is in fact a dominant strategy. Extensive numerical experimentation illustrates the efficacy of our approach, which we compare to a cooperative baseline. We demonstrate that with as few as two candidates, our improved mechanism leads to as much as a 76% reduction in energy consumption, and that with as few as three candidates, the transmission time decreases by as much as 55\%. Further, we see that as the number of candidates increases, the performance of our mechanism approaches that of the cooperative baseline. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of multi-attribute auctions to enhance the efficiency of data transfer in non-cooperative settings.</description>

      <title>Distributed Detection of Adversarial Attacks for Resilient Cooperation of Multi-Robot Systems with Intermittent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the consensus and formation of a network of mobile autonomous agents in adversarial settings where a group of malicious (compromised) agents are subject to deception attacks. In addition, the communication network is arbitrarily time-varying and subject to intermittent connections, possibly imposed by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We provide explicit bounds for network connectivity in an integral sense, enabling the characterization of the system's resilience to specific classes of adversarial attacks. We also show that under the condition of connectivity in an integral sense uniformly in time, the system is finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_{p}$ stable and uniformly exponentially fast consensus and formation are achievable, provided malicious agents are detected and isolated from the network. We present a distributed and reconfigurable framework with theoretical guarantees for detecting malicious agents, allowing for the resilient cooperation of the remaining cooperative agents. Simulation studies are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning has shown promise for improving sample efficiency and decision-making in complex environments. However, existing methods face challenges in training stability, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose Bisimulation Metric for Model Predictive Control (BS-MPC), a novel approach that incorporates bisimulation metric loss in its objective function to directly optimize the encoder. This time-step-wise direct optimization enables the learned encoder to extract intrinsic information from the original state space while discarding irrelevant details and preventing the gradients and errors from diverging. BS-MPC improves training stability, robustness against input noise, and computational efficiency by reducing training time. We evaluate BS-MPC on both continuous control and image-based tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Universal Formulation for Path-Parametric Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a unified framework for path-parametric planning and control. This formulation is universal as it standardizes the entire spectrum of path-parametric techniques -- from traditional path following to more recent contouring or progress-maximizing Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning -- under a single framework. The ingredients underlying this universality are twofold: First, we present a compact and efficient technique capable of computing singularity-free, smooth and differentiable moving frames. Second, we derive a spatial path parameterization of the Cartesian coordinates applicable to any arbitrary curve without prior assumptions on its parametric speed or moving frame, and that perfectly interplays with the aforementioned path parameterization method. The combination of these two ingredients leads to a planning and control framework that brings togehter existing path-parametric techniques in literature. Aiming to unify all these approaches, we open source PACOR, a software library that implements the presented content, thereby providing a self-contained toolkit for the formulation of path-parametric planning and control methods.</description>

      <title>Predictive Spliner: Data-Driven Overtaking in Autonomous Racing Using Opponent Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Head-to-head racing against opponents is a challenging and emerging topic in the domain of autonomous racing. We propose Predictive Spliner, a data-driven overtaking planner that learns the behavior of opponents through Gaussian Process (GP) regression, which is then leveraged to compute viable overtaking maneuvers in future sections of the racing track. Experimentally validated on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) information to perceive the opponent, Predictive Spliner outperforms State-of-the-Art (SotA) algorithms by overtaking opponents at up to 83.1% of its own speed, being on average 8.4% faster than the previous best-performing method. Additionally, it achieves an average success rate of 84.5%, which is 47.6% higher than the previous best-performing method. The method maintains computational efficiency with a Central Processing Unit (CPU) load of 22.79% and a computation time of 8.4 ms, evaluated on a Commercial off-the-Shelf (CotS) Intel i7-1165G7, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications. These results highlight the potential of Predictive Spliner to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous racing vehicles. The code for Predictive Spliner is available at: https://github.com/ForzaETH/predictive-spliner.</description>

      <title>Active Inference for Closed-loop transmit beamsteering in Fetal Doppler Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doppler ultrasound is widely used to monitor fetal heart rate during labor and pregnancy. Unfortunately, it is highly sensitive to fetal and maternal movements, which can cause the displacement of the fetal heart with respect to the ultrasound beam, in turn reducing the Doppler signal-to-noise ratio and leading to erratic, noisy, or missing heart rate readings. To tackle this issue, we augment the conventional Doppler ultrasound system with a rational agent that autonomously steers the ultrasound beam to track the position of the fetal heart. The proposed cognitive ultrasound system leverages a sequential Monte Carlo method to infer the fetal heart position from the power Doppler signal, and employs a greedy information-seeking criterion to select the steering angle that minimizes the positional uncertainty for future timesteps. The fetal heart rate is then calculated using the Doppler signal at the estimated fetal heart position. Our results show that the system can accurately track the fetal heart position across challenging signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, mainly thanks to its dynamic transmit beam steering capability. Additionally, we find that optimizing the transmit beamsteering to minimize positional uncertainty also optimizes downstream heart rate estimation performance. In conclusion, this work showcases the power of closed-loop cognitive ultrasound in boosting the capabilities of traditional systems.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Scheduling Mechanism for Scalable and Resource-Efficient Centralized Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to address the challenges of deploying complex robotic software in large-scale systems, i.e., Centralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (CNMPCs) for multi-agent systems. The proposed approach is based on a Kubernetes-based scheduling mechanism designed to monitor and optimize the operation of CNMPCs, while addressing the scalability limitation of centralized control schemes. By leveraging a cluster in a real-time cloud environment, the proposed mechanism effectively offloads the computational burden of CNMPCs. Through experiments, we have demonstrated the effectiveness and performance of our system, especially in scenarios where the number of robots is subject to change. Our work contributes to the advancement of cloud-based control strategies and lays the foundation for enhanced performance in cloud-controlled robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Goal-Conditioned Terminal Value Estimation for Real-time and Multi-task Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While MPC enables nonlinear feedback control by solving an optimal control problem at each timestep, the computational burden tends to be significantly large, making it difficult to optimize a policy within the control period. To address this issue, one possible approach is to utilize terminal value learning to reduce computational costs. However, the learned value cannot be used for other tasks in situations where the task dynamically changes in the original MPC setup. In this study, we develop an MPC framework with goal-conditioned terminal value learning to achieve multitask policy optimization while reducing computational time. Furthermore, by using a hierarchical control structure that allows the upper-level trajectory planner to output appropriate goal-conditioned trajectories, we demonstrate that a robot model is able to generate diverse motions. We evaluate the proposed method on a bipedal inverted pendulum robot model and confirm that combining goal-conditioned terminal value learning with an upper-level trajectory planner enables real-time control; thus, the robot successfully tracks a target trajectory on sloped terrain.</description>

      <title>Function Gradient Approximation with Random Shallow ReLU Networks with Control Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are widely used to approximate unknown functions in control. A common neural network architecture uses a single hidden layer (i.e. a shallow network), in which the input parameters are fixed in advance and only the output parameters are trained. The typical formal analysis asserts that if output parameters exist to approximate the unknown function with sufficient accuracy, then desired control performance can be achieved. A long-standing theoretical gap was that no conditions existed to guarantee that, for the fixed input parameters, required accuracy could be obtained by training the output parameters. Our recent work has partially closed this gap by demonstrating that if input parameters are chosen randomly, then for any sufficiently smooth function, with high-probability there are output parameters resulting in $O((1/m)^{1/2})$ approximation errors, where $m$ is the number of neurons. However, some applications, notably continuous-time value function approximation, require that the network approximates the both the unknown function and its gradient with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that randomly generated input parameters and trained output parameters result in gradient errors of $O((\log(m)/m)^{1/2})$, and additionally, improve the constants from our prior work. We show how to apply the result to policy evaluation problems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Control for Autonomous Hydraulic Material Handling Machines with Underactuated Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise and safe control of heavy material handling machines presents numerous challenges due to the hard-to-model hydraulically actuated joints and the need for collision-free trajectory planning with a free-swinging end-effector tool. In this work, we propose an RL-based controller that commands the cabin joint and the arm simultaneously. It is trained in a simulation combining data-driven modeling techniques with first-principles modeling. On the one hand, we employ a neural network model to capture the highly nonlinear dynamics of the upper carriage turn hydraulic motor, incorporating explicit pressure prediction to handle delays better. On the other hand, we model the arm as velocity-controllable and the free-swinging end-effector tool as a damped pendulum using first principles. This combined model enhances our simulation environment, enabling the training of RL controllers that can be directly transferred to the real machine. Designed to reach steady-state Cartesian targets, the RL controller learns to leverage the hydraulic dynamics to improve accuracy, maintain high speeds, and minimize end-effector tool oscillations. Our controller, tested on a mid-size prototype material handler, is more accurate than an inexperienced operator and causes fewer tool oscillations. It demonstrates competitive performance even compared to an experienced professional driver.</description>

      <title>AlphaRouter: Quantum Circuit Routing with Reinforcement Learning and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to outperform classical computers in important tasks such as optimization and number factoring. They are characterized by limited connectivity, which necessitates the routing of their computational bits, known as qubits, to specific locations during program execution to carry out quantum operations. Traditionally, the NP-hard optimization problem of minimizing the routing overhead has been addressed through sub-optimal rule-based routing techniques with inherent human biases embedded within the cost function design. This paper introduces a solution that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our RL-based router, called AlphaRouter, outperforms the current state-of-the-art routing methods and generates quantum programs with up to $20\%$ less routing overhead, thus significantly enhancing the overall efficiency and feasibility of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimal Covariance Steering for Discrete-Time Linear Stochastic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal control problem for steering the state covariance of a discrete-time linear stochastic system over a finite time horizon. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control law for a quadratic cost function. Then, we show the separation of the optimal mean and the covariance steering problems. We also develop efficient computational methods to solve for the optimal control law, which is identified as the solution to a semi-definite program. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical examples. In the process, we also obtain some novel theoretical results for a matrix Riccati difference equation, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An active learning method for solving competitive multi-agent decision-making and control problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12561v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To identify a stationary action profile for a population of competitive agents, each executing private strategies, we introduce a novel active-learning scheme where a centralized external observer (or entity) can probe the agents' reactions and recursively update simple local parametric estimates of the action-reaction mappings. Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action-reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile. Extensive numerical simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision-making problems illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach.</description>

      <title>Who should pay for frequency-containment ancillary services? Making responsible units bear the cost to shape investment in generation and loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the operating cost of electricity grids based on thermal generation was largely driven by the cost of fuel, as renewable penetration increases, ancillary services represent an increasingly large proportion of the running costs. Electric frequency is an important magnitude in highly renewable grids, as it becomes more volatile and therefore the cost related to maintaining it within safe bounds has significantly increased. So far, costs for frequency-containment ancillary services have been socialised in most countries, but it has become relevant to rethink this regulatory arrangement. In this paper, we discuss the issue of cost allocation for these services, highlighting the need to evolve towards a causation-based regulatory framework. We argue that parties responsible for creating the need for ancillary services should bear these costs. However, this would imply an important change in electricity market policy, therefore it is necessary to understand the impact on current and future investments on generation, as well as on electricity tariffs. Here we provide a mostly qualitative analysis of this issue, defining guidelines for practical implementation and further study.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimal Coverage Control in Multi-agent Systems: Known and Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to solve the coverage optimization problem in multi-agent systems. The proposed technique offers an optimal solution with a lower cost with respect to conventional Voronoi-based techniques by effectively handling the issue of agents remaining stationary in regions void of information using a ranking function. The proposed approach leverages a novel cost function for optimizing the agents coverage and the cost function eventually aligns with the conventional Voronoi-based cost function. Theoretical analyses are conducted to assure the asymptotic convergence of agents towards the optimal configuration. A distinguishing feature of this approach lies in its departure from the reliance on geometric methods that are characteristic of Voronoi-based approaches; hence can be implemented more simply. Remarkably, the technique is adaptive and applicable to various environments with both known and unknown information distributions. Lastly, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations, and the obtained results are compared with those of Voronoi-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Feedback-feedforward Signal Control with Exogenous Demand Estimation in Congested Urban Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To cope with uncertain traffic patterns and traffic models, traffic-responsive signal control strategies in the literature are designed to be robust to these uncertainties. These robust strategies still require sensing infrastructure to implement traffic-responsiveness. In this paper, we take a novel perspective and show that it is possible to use the already necessary sensing infrastructure to estimate the uncertain quantities in real time. Specifically, resorting to the store-and-forward model, we design a novel network-wide traffic-responsive strategy that estimates the occupancy and exogenous demand in each link, i.e., entering (exiting) vehicle flows at the origins (destinations) of the network or within links, in real time. Borrowing from optimal control theory, we design an optimal linear quadratic control scheme, consisting of a linear feedback term, of the occupancy of the road links, and a feedforward component, which accounts for the varying exogenous vehicle load on the network. Thereby, the resulting control scheme is a simple feedback-feedforward controller, which is fed with occupancy and exogenous demand estimates, and is suitable for real-time implementation. Numerical simulations for the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, show that, for realistic surges in the exogenous demand, the proposed solution significantly outperforms tried-and-tested solutions that ignore the exogenous demand.</description>

      <title>Risk of Cascading Collisions in Network of Vehicles with Delayed Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes and explores a framework to analyze the risk of cascading failures in a platoon of autonomous vehicles, accounting for communication time-delays and input uncertainty. Our proposed framework yields closed-form expressions for cascading collisions, which we quantify using the coherent Average Value-at-Risk ($\AVAR$) to assess the cascading effect of vehicle collisions within the platoon. We investigate how factors such as network connectivity, system dynamics, communication delays, and uncertainty contribute to the emergence of cascading failures. Our findings are extended to standard communication graphs with symmetries, allowing us to evaluate the risk of cascading collisions from a platoon design perspective. Furthermore, by discovering the boundedness of the inter-vehicle distances, we reveal the best achievable risk of cascading collision with general graph topologies, which is further specified for special communication graph, such as the complete graph. Our theoretical results pave the way for the development of a safety-aware framework aimed at mitigating the risk of cascading collisions in vehicle platoons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural global parameter identifiability indicates whether one can determine a parameter's value in an ODE model from given inputs and outputs. If a given model has parameters for which there is exactly one value, such parameters are called globally identifiable. Given an ODE model involving not globally identifiable parameters, first we transform the system into one with locally identifiable parameters. As a main contribution of this paper, then we present a procedure for replacing, if possible, the ODE model with an equivalent one that has globally identifiable parameters. We first derive this as an algorithm for one-dimensional ODE models and then reuse this approach for higher-dimensional models.</description>

Abstract: Replay is a powerful strategy to promote learning in artificial intelligence and the brain. However, the conditions to generate it and its functional advantages have not been fully recognized. In this study, we develop a modular reinforcement learning model that could generate replay. We prove that replay generated in this way helps complete the task. We also analyze the information contained in the representation and provide a mechanism for how replay makes a difference. Our design avoids complex assumptions and enables replay to emerge naturally within a task-optimized paradigm. Our model also reproduces key phenomena observed in biological agents. This research explores the structural biases in modular ANN to generate replay and its potential utility in developing efficient RL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated control strategy for optimal fast charging and active thermal management of Lithium-ion batteries in extreme ambient temperatures, striking a balance between charging speed and battery health. A control-oriented thermal-NDC (nonlinear double-capacitor) battery model is proposed to describe the electrical and thermal dynamics, incorporating the effects of both an active thermal source and ambient temperature. A state-feedback model predictive control algorithm is then developed for optimal fast charging and active thermal management. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm under extreme temperatures, showing that the proposed algorithm can energy-efficiently adjust the battery temperature, thereby balancing charging speed and battery health. Additionally, an output-feedback model predictive control algorithm with an extended Kalman filter is proposed for battery charging when states are partially measurable. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness under extreme temperatures.</description>

      <title>Predicting DC-Link Capacitor Current Ripple in AC-DC Rectifier Circuits Using Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-turbo allow users to refine the model based on newer information, known as ``fine-tuning''. This paper leverages this ability to analyze AC-DC converter behaviors, focusing on the ripple current in DC-link capacitors. Capacitors degrade faster under high ripple currents, complicating life monitoring and necessitating preemptive replacements. Using minimal invasive noisy hardware measurements from a full bridge rectifier and 90W Power Factor Correction (PFC) boost converter, an LLM-based models to predict ripple content in DC-link currents was developed which demonstrated the LLMs' ability for near-accurate predictions. This study also highlights data requirements for precise nonlinear power electronic circuit parameter predictions to predict component degradation without any additional sensors. Furthermore, the proposed framework could be extended to any non-linear function mapping problem as well as estimating the capacitor Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the safety filter, designed based on the CBF, to the output generation of the baseline LLM, i.e., the sequence of the token, with the aim of intervening in the generated text. The overall text-generation system is implemented with Llama 3 and a RoBERTa model, and the source code is available at https://github.com/Mya-Mya/CBF-LLM. The experiment demonstrates its control ability and effectiveness in reducing the number of interventions needed for user-specified alignment tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we learn dynamics models for parametrized families of dynamical systems with varying properties. The dynamics models are formulated as stochastic processes conditioned on a latent context variable which is inferred from observed transitions of the respective system. The probabilistic formulation allows us to compute an action sequence which, for a limited number of environment interactions, optimally explores the given system within the parametrized family. This is achieved by steering the system through transitions being most informative for the context variable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for exploration on a non-linear toy-problem and two well-known reinforcement learning environments.</description>

Abstract: We consider irreversible and coupled reversible-irreversible nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems and the respective sets of thermodynamic equilibria. In particular, we are concerned with optimal state transitions and output stabilization on finite-time horizons. We analyze a class of optimal control problems, where the performance functional can be interpreted as a linear combination of energy supply, entropy generation, or exergy supply. Our results establish the integral turnpike property towards the set of thermodynamic equilibria providing a rigorous connection of optimal system trajectories to optimal steady states. Throughout the paper, we illustrate our findings by means of two examples: a network of heat exchangers and a gas-piston system.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Robust Data-driven Predictive Control for Smoothing Mixed Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a mixed traffic with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexisting, data-driven predictive control of CAVs promises system-wide traffic performance improvements. Yet, most existing approaches focus on a centralized setup, which is not computationally scalable while failing to protect data privacy. The robustness against unknown disturbances has not been well addressed either, causing safety concerns. In this paper, we propose a decentralized robust DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control) approach for CAVs to smooth mixed traffic flow. In particular, each CAV computes its control input based on locally available data from its involved subsystem. Meanwhile, the interaction between neighboring subsystems is modeled as a bounded disturbance, for which appropriate estimation methods are proposed. Then, we formulate a robust optimization problem and present its tractable computational solutions. Compared with the centralized formulation, our method greatly reduces computation burden with better safety performance, while naturally preserving data privacy. Extensive traffic simulations validate its wave-dampening ability, safety performance, and computational benefits.</description>

      <title>Symbolic-numeric algorithm for parameter estimation in discrete-time models with $\exp$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic models describe phenomena across scientific disciplines, yet to make these models useful in application the unknown parameter values of the models must be determined. Discrete-time dynamic models are widely used to model biological processes, but it is often difficult to determine these parameters. In this paper, we propose a symbolic-numeric approach for parameter estimation in discrete-time models that involve univariate non-algebraic (locally) analytic functions such as exp. We illustrate the performance (precision) of our approach by applying our approach to two archetypal discrete-time models in biology (the flour beetle 'LPA' model and discrete Lotka-Volterra competition model). Unlike optimization-based methods, our algorithm guarantees to find all solutions of the parameter values up to a specified precision given time-series data for the measured variables provided that there are finitely many parameter values that fit the data and that the used polynomial system solver can find all roots of the associated polynomial system with interval coefficients.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Step Duration for Precise Foot Placement: Achieving Robust Bipedal Locomotion on Terrains with Restricted Footholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional one-step preview planning algorithms for bipedal locomotion struggle to generate viable gaits when walking across terrains with restricted footholds, such as stepping stones. To overcome such limitations, this paper introduces a novel multi-step preview foot placement planning algorithm based on the step-to-step discrete evolution of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) of walking robots. Our proposed approach adaptively changes the step duration and the swing foot trajectory for optimal foot placement under constraints, thereby enhancing the long-term stability of the robot and significantly improving its ability to navigate environments with tight constraints on viable footholds. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various simulation scenarios with complex stepping-stone configurations and external perturbations. These tests underscore its improved performance for navigating foothold-restricted terrains, even with external disturbances.</description>

      <title>A Moreau Envelope Approach for LQR Meta-Policy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of policy estimation for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in discrete-time linear time-invariant uncertain dynamical systems. We propose a Moreau Envelope-based surrogate LQR cost, built from a finite set of realizations of the uncertain system, to define a meta-policy efficiently adjustable to new realizations. Moreover, we design an algorithm to find an approximate first-order stationary point of the meta-LQR cost function. Numerical results show that the proposed approach outperforms naive averaging of controllers on new realizations of the linear system. We also provide empirical evidence that our method has better sample complexity than Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approaches.</description>

      <title>Koopman Analysis of the Singularly-Perturbed van der Pol Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework holds promise for spectral analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems based on linear operators. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, so-called Koopman eigenvalues and Koopman eigenfunctions, respectively, mirror global properties of the system's flow. In this paper we perform the Koopman analysis of the singularly-perturbed van der Pol system. First, we show the spectral signature depending on singular perturbation: how two Koopman {principal} eigenvalues are ordered and what distinct shapes emerge in their associated Koopman eigenfunctions. Second, we discuss the singular limit of the Koopman operator, which is derived through the concatenation of Koopman operators for the fast and slow subsystems. From the spectral properties of the Koopman operator for the {singularly}-perturbed system and the singular limit, we suggest that the Koopman eigenfunctions inherit geometric properties of the singularly-perturbed system. These results are applicable to general planar singularly-perturbed systems with stable limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Auto-Multilift: Distributed Learning and Control for Cooperative Load Transportation With Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04858v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing motion control and planning algorithms for multilift systems remains challenging due to the complexities of dynamics, collision avoidance, actuator limits, and scalability. Existing methods that use optimization and distributed techniques effectively address these constraints and scalability issues. However, they often require substantial manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes Auto-Multilift, a novel framework that automates the tuning of model predictive controllers (MPCs) for multilift systems. We model the MPC cost functions with deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling fast online adaptation to various scenarios. We develop a distributed policy gradient algorithm to train these DNNs efficiently in a closed-loop manner. Central to our algorithm is distributed sensitivity propagation, which is built on fully exploiting the unique dynamic couplings within the multilift system. It parallelizes gradient computation across quadrotors and focuses on actual system state sensitivities relative to key MPC parameters. Extensive simulations demonstrate favorable scalability to a large number of quadrotors. Our method outperforms a state-of-the-art open-loop MPC tuning approach by effectively learning adaptive MPCs from trajectory tracking errors. It also excels in learning an adaptive reference for reconfiguring the system when traversing multiple narrow slots.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Learning Models for Bionic Robots: Non-Linear Transfer Function Identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control and modeling of robot dynamics have increasingly adopted model-free control strategies using machine learning. Given the non-linear elastic nature of bionic robotic systems, learning-based methods provide reliable alternatives by utilizing numerical data to establish a direct mapping from actuation inputs to robot trajectories without complex kinematics models. However, for developers, the method of identifying an appropriate learning model for their specific bionic robots and further constructing the transfer function has not been thoroughly discussed. Thus, this research introduces a comprehensive evaluation strategy and framework for the application of model-free control, including data collection, learning model selection, comparative analysis, and transfer function identification to effectively deal with the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) robotic data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shield Synthesis via State-Space Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19911v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of synthesizing safety strategies for control systems, also known as shields. Since the state space is infinite, shields are typically computed over a finite-state abstraction, with the most common abstraction being a rectangular grid. However, for many systems, such a grid does not align well with the safety property or the system dynamics. That is why a coarse grid is rarely sufficient, but a fine grid is typically computationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we show that appropriate state-space transformations can still allow to use a coarse grid at almost no computational overhead. We demonstrate in three case studies that our transformation-based synthesis outperforms a standard synthesis by several orders of magnitude. In the first two case studies, we use domain knowledge to select a suitable transformation. In the third case study, we instead report on results in engineering a transformation without domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>SustainDC -- Benchmarking for Sustainable Data Center Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Visual collective behaviors on spherical robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of collective motion, traditionally, disregard the limited sensing capabilities of an individual, to instead assuming an omniscient perception of the environment. This study implements a visual flocking model in a ``robot-in-the-loop'' approach to reproduce these behaviors with a flock composed of 10 independent spherical robots. The model achieves robotic collective motion by only using panoramic visual information of each robot, such as retinal position, optical size and optic flow of the neighboring robots. We introduce a virtual anchor to confine the collective robotic movements so to avoid wall interactions. For the first time, a simple visual robot-in-the-loop approach succeed in reproducing several collective motion phases, in particular, swarming, and milling. Another milestone achieved with by this model is bridging the gap between simulation and physical experiments by demonstrating nearly identical behaviors in both environments with the same visual model. To conclude, we show that our minimal visual collective motion model is sufficient to recreate most collective behaviors on a robot-in-the-loop system that is scalable, behaves as numerical simulations predict and is easily comparable to traditional models.</description>

      <title>Research on Enhancing C-V2X Communication via Danger-Aware Vehicular Networking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a protocol that optimizes message dissemination in C-V2X technology, crucial for advancing intelligent transportation systems (ITS) aimed at enhancing road safety. As vehicle density and velocity rise, the volume of data requiring communication significantly increases. By considering the risk levels that vehicles encounter and using inter-vehicle proximity as a key indicator of potential hazards, the proposed protocol prioritizes communication, allowing vehicles facing higher risks to transmit their messages first. Our results show that this prioritization effectively reduces the number of concurrent transmissions, leading to improved performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, latency, and lower probabilities of channel congestion and collision.</description>

      <title>Barycentric rational approximation for learning the index of a dynamical system from limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of data-driven identification of dynamical systems, specifically for systems whose behavior at large frequencies is non-standard, as encoded by a non-trivial relative degree of the transfer function or, alternatively, a non-trivial index of a corresponding realization as a descriptor system. We develop novel surrogate modeling strategies that allow state-of-the-art rational approximation algorithms (e.g., AAA and vector fitting) to better handle data coming from such systems with non-trivial relative degree. Our contribution is twofold. On one hand, we describe a strategy to build rational surrogate models with prescribed relative degree, with the objective of mirroring the high-frequency behavior of the high-fidelity problem, when known. The surrogate model's desired degree is achieved through constraints on its barycentric coefficients, rather than through ad-hoc modifications of the rational form. On the other hand, we present a degree-identification routine that allows one to estimate the unknown relative degree of a system from low-frequency data. By identifying the degree of the system that generated the data, we can build a surrogate model that, in addition to matching the data well (at low frequencies), has enhanced extrapolation capabilities (at high frequencies). We showcase the effectiveness and robustness of the newly proposed method through a suite of numerical tests.</description>
