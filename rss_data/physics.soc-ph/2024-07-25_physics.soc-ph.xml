      <title>Opinion dynamics on switching networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study opinion dynamics over a directed multilayer network. In particular, we consider networks in which the impact of neighbors of agents on their opinions is proportional to their in-degree. Agents update their opinions over time to coordinate with their neighbors. However, the frequency of agents' interactions with neighbors in different network layers differs. Consequently, the multilayer network's adjacency matrices are time-varying. We aim to characterize how the frequency of activation of different layers impacts the convergence of the opinion dynamics process.</description>

      <title>Context-aware knowledge graph framework for traffic speed forecasting using graph neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility is intricately influenced by urban contexts spatially and temporally, constituting essential domain knowledge in understanding traffic systems. While existing traffic forecasting models primarily rely on raw traffic data and advanced deep learning techniques, incorporating contextual information remains underexplored due to the lack of effective integration frameworks and the complexity of urban contexts. This study proposes a novel context-aware knowledge graph (CKG) framework to enhance traffic speed forecasting by effectively modeling spatial and temporal contexts. Employing a relation-dependent integration strategy, the framework generates context-aware representations from the spatial and temporal units of CKG to capture spatio-temporal dependencies of urban contexts. A CKG-GNN model, combining the CKG, dual-view multi-head self-attention (MHSA), and graph neural network (GNN), is then designed to predict traffic speed using these context-aware representations. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG's configuration significantly influences embedding performance, with ComplEx and KG2E emerging as optimal for embedding spatial and temporal units, respectively. The CKG-GNN model surpasses benchmark models, achieving an average MAE of $3.46\pm0.01$ and a MAPE of $14.76\pm0.09\%$ for traffic speed predictions from 10 to 120 minutes. The dual-view MHSA analysis reveals the crucial role of relation-dependent features from the context-based view and the model's ability to prioritize recent time slots in prediction from the sequence-based view. The CKG framework's model-agnostic nature suggests its potential applicability in various applications of intelligent transportation systems. Overall, this study underscores the importance of incorporating domain-specific contexts into traffic forecasting and merging context-aware knowledge graphs with neural networks to enhance accuracy.</description>

      <title>Revealing urban area from mobile positioning data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers face the trade-off between publishing mobility data along with their papers while simultaneously protecting the privacy of the individuals. In addition to the fundamental anonymization process, other techniques, such as spatial discretization and, in certain cases, location concealing or complete removal, are applied to achieve these dual objectives. The primary research question is whether concealing the observation area is an adequate form of protection or whether human mobility patterns in urban areas are inherently revealing of location. The characteristics of the mobility data, such as the number of activity records or the number of unique users in a given spatial unit, reveal the silhouette of the urban landscape, which can be used to infer the identity of the city in question. It was demonstrated that even without disclosing the exact location, the patterns of human mobility can still reveal the urban area from which the data was collected. The presented locating method was tested on other cities using different open data sets and against coarser spatial discretization units. While publishing mobility data is essential for research, it was demonstrated that concealing the observation area is insufficient to prevent the identification of the urban area. Furthermore, using larger discretization units alone is an ineffective solution to the problem of the observation area re-identification. Instead of obscuring the observation area, noise should be added to the trajectories to prevent user identification.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Coarse-Grained Socioeconomic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven machine-learning approach for modeling space-time socioeconomic dynamics. Through coarse-graining fine-scale observations, our modeling framework simplifies these complex systems to a set of tractable mechanistic relationships -- in the form of ordinary differential equations -- while preserving critical system behaviors. This approach allows for expedited 'what if' studies and sensitivity analyses, essential for informed policy-making. Our findings, from a case study of Baltimore, MD, indicate that this machine learning-augmented coarse-grained model serves as a powerful instrument for deciphering the complex interactions between social factors, geography, and exogenous stressors, offering a valuable asset for system forecasting and resilience planning.</description>

      <title>Identification of a time-varying SIR Model for Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout human history, epidemics have been a constant presence. Understanding their dynamics is essential to predict scenarios and make substantiated decisions. Mathematical models are powerful tools to describe an epidemic behavior. Among the most used, the compartmental ones stand out, dividing population into classes with well-defined characteristics. One of the most known is the $SIR$ model, based on a set of differential equations describing the rates of change of three categories over time. These equations take into account parameters such as the disease transmission rate and the recovery rate, which both change over time. However, classical models use constant parameters and can not describe the behavior of a disease over long periods. In this work, it is proposed a $SIR$ model with time-varying transmission rate parameter with a method to estimate this parameter based on an optimization problem, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors between the model and historical data. Additionally, based on the infection rates determined by the algorithm, the model's ability to predict disease activity in future scenarios was also investigated. Epidemic data released by the government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil was used to evaluate the models, where the models shown a very good forecasting ability, resulting in errors for predicting the total number of accumulated infected persons of 0.13% for 7 days ahead and 0.6% for 14 days ahead.</description>

      <title>Determination of the mean center of a region: A physics-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean center of a geographical region, including continents and countries, has been mostly determined to study the trend of population migration, the shift of economic hubs, and the spatial change of extreme climate events. However, the determination of the mean center is a formidable task as it deals with the curvature of the earth's surface. Here, we report a physics-based model to determine the mean center of a region. Our method provides the analytical expression for the location of the mean center for both flat and curved spaces, such as straight lines, circles, planes, three-dimensional space, cylinders, and spheres. Some of these expressions are often used to compute the center of mass of the physical system. Therefore, the implication of our model in the physical system extends the general validity of the model. Furthermore, we have computed various mean centers of India, such as the geographical, population, and crime centers. We have also assessed the year-wise movement of the crime center and found a spatial trend towards the north.</description>

      <title>A Non-Expert's Introduction to Data Ethics for Mathematicians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. I then briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary and some closing remarks.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>Brand Network Booster: A new system for improving brand connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new decision support system offered for an in-depth analysis of semantic networks, which can provide insights for a better exploration of a brand's image and the improvement of its connectivity. In terms of network analysis, we show that this goal is achieved by solving an extended version of the Maximum Betweenness Improvement problem, which includes the possibility of considering adversarial nodes, constrained budgets, and weighted networks - where connectivity improvement can be obtained by adding links or increasing the weight of existing connections. Our contribution includes a new algorithmic framework and the integration of this framework into a software system called Brand Network Booster (BNB), which supports brand connectivity evaluation and improvement. We present this new system together with three case studies, and we also discuss its performance. Our tool and approach are valuable to both network scholars and in facilitating strategic decision-making processes for marketing and communication managers across various sectors, be it public or private.</description>
