      <title>Amide Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange in Isotopically Mixed Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) of protein backbone amides provides a powerful probe of conformational dynamics. However, when experiments are performed in H2O/D2O mixtures, quantitative interpretation is hindered by back exchange and isotope effects not captured by the classical Linderstrom-Lang (LL) model. We introduce a generalized Linderstrom-Lang (GLL) framework that explicitly accounts for forward and reverse exchange and for changes in protection upon isotopic substitution. Analytical solutions describe equilibrium enrichment (fractionation) and protection factors in mixtures, reducing to the LL model in pure D2O. Application to HDX/NMR of the molecular chaperone DNAJB1 in 50% D2O demonstrates that the GLL model recovers protection factors at 100% D2O. Ignoring back exchange (i.e., using the LL model) causes protection factors to be systematically underestimated. A particularly powerful feature of our approach is that a single HDX experiment in a mixture (e.g., 50% D2O) simultaneously provides protection factors that report on conformational dynamics and local stability, and fractionation factors that are sensitive to the local hydrogen-bonding environment.</description>

      <title>FSIM: A Pedagogical and Extensible HPC Framework for the Hartree-Fock Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient computation of molecular integrals and Hartree-Fock energy remains a central topic in quantum-chemistry algorithm development. Although many sophisticated open-source packages are available, understanding their implementations from first principles can be difficult for students and developers alike. In this work, we present a concise overview and an extensible pedagogical framework that implements the Hartree-Fock method and the McMurchie-Davidson scheme for molecular integral evaluation. The implementation follows an object-oriented design in C++, emphasizing clarity and modularity. We also discuss strategies for parallel execution, including distributed computing with MPI and shared-memory parallelization with OpenMP. Beyond presenting a working reference, this work establishes a learning platform for further exploration, including suggested mini-projects for algorithmic optimization and HPC scalability. The accompanying open-source library, FSIM, described in this work, serves as a compact resource for teaching and research in computational chemistry and high-performance computing.</description>

      <title>Reactive capacitance of flat patches of arbitrary shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary shape to trap independent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the three-dimensional space. We focus on the total flux of particles onto the patch that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the respective roles of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive several bounds on the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with respect to the reactivity and the shape. Two probabilistic interpretations are presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for solving the associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose and validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit approximation for the reactive capacitance that depends only on the surface area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch. This approximation opens promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct applications of these results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are discussed.</description>

      <title>Cross Learning between Electronic Structure Theories for Unifying Molecular, Surface, and Inorganic Crystal Foundation Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating a single unified interatomic potential capable of attaining ab initio accuracy across all chemistry remains a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry and materials science. This work introduces a training protocol for foundation machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that bridge molecular, surface, and materials chemistry through cross-domain learning. First, we introduce enhancements to the MACE architecture that improve its performance on chemically diverse databases by increasing weight sharing across chemical elements and introducing non-linear factors into the tensor decomposition of the product basis. Second, we develop a multi-head replay post-training methodology that enables efficient knowledge transfer across diverse chemical domains. By fine-tuning on datasets at different levels of electronic structure theory, including inorganic crystals, molecular systems, surface chemistry, and reactive organic chemistry, we demonstrate that a single unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance across several chemical domains. Comprehensive benchmarking reveals superior cross-domain transferability compared with existing specialised and multi-task models, with notable improvements in molecular and surface properties while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in materials-property prediction.</description>

      <title>Vector-Based Approach to the Stoichiometric Analysis of Multicomponent Chemical Reactions: The Case of Black Powder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study demonstrates the capabilities of a vector-based approach for calculating stoichiometric coefficients in chemical equations, using black powder as an illustrative example. A method is proposed for selecting and constraining intermediate interactions between reactants, as well as for identifying final products. It is shown that even a small number of components can lead to a large number of final and intermediate products. Through concrete calculations, a correlation is established between the number of possible chemical equations and the number of reactants. A methodology is proposed for computing all possible chemical equations within a reaction system for arbitrary component ratios, enabling the derivation of all feasible chemical reactions. Additionally, a method is developed for calculating the chemical composition for a fixed set of reactants, allowing for the evaluation of the set of products resulting from all possible chemical interactions given a specified initial composition.</description>

      <title>A Vector-Based Algorithm for Generating Complete Balanced Reaction Sets with Arbitrary Numbers of Reagents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a vector-based method to balance chemical reactions. The algorithm builds candidates in a deterministic way, removes duplicates, and always prints coefficients in the lowest whole-number form. For redox cases, electrons and protons/hydroxide are treated explicitly, so both mass and charge are balanced. We also outline the basic principles of the vector formulation of stoichiometry, interpreting reactions as integer vectors in composition space, this geometric view supports compact visualizations of reagent-product interactions and helps surface distinct reaction families. The method enumerates valid balances for arbitrary user-specified species lists without special-case balancing rules or symbolic tricks, and it provides a clean foundation for developing new algorithmic variants (e.g., alternative objectives or constraints). On representative examples (neutralization, double displacement, decomposition, classical redox, small multicomponent sets) and a negative control, the method produced correct integer balances. When multiple balances exist, we report a canonical one - minimizing the total coefficient sum with a simple tie-breaker - without claiming global optimality beyond the solutions the search enumerates. The procedure applies per reaction and extends to reaction networks via consistent per-reaction application. We do not report runtimes, broader benchmarking and code/data release are planned.</description>

      <title>Molecular vibrational mid-IR radiation amplified by high-biased graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission resonating with molecular vibration is one of the important pathways to deliver heat energy required for various chemical reactions. However, its practical applications have been limited due to the lack of high-power large-area mid-IR sources so far. Here we report that graphene layers coupled with the vibrational excitation modes of substrates can generate intense mid-IR radiation at high bias. This is potentially related to the high-current driven nonequilibrium phenomena, where sonic-boom-like shock waves at the graphene/substrate interface can induce the overflow of excited molecular vibrations in substrates followed by spontaneous or stimulated transitions to ground states. The resulting mid-IR radiation is highly efficient in thermal energy generation and transfer, which is expected to significantly reduce power consumption in homes and industries.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Transferable Pauli Exchange-Repulsion for Molecules with the Anisotropic Valence Density Overlap Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli exchange-repulsion is the dominant short-range intermolecular interaction and it is an essential component of molecular force fields. Current approaches to modeling Pauli repulsion in molecular force fields often rely on over 20 atom types to achieve chemical accuracy. The number of parameters in these approaches hampers the development of force fields with quantum-chemical accuracy that are transferable across many chemical systems. We present the anisotropic valence density overlap (AVDO) model for exchange-repulsion. The model produces sub-kcal/mol accuracy for dimers of organic molecules from the S101x7 dataset, a representative set of the most common biologically relevant intermolecular interactions, and for acene dimers of increasing size. It uses a single universal parameter, related to an atomic cross-sectional area, that is transferable across chemical systems. Given recent progress in machine learning the electronic density, this model offers a promising path toward high-accuracy, next-generation machine-learned force fields.</description>

      <title>Extracting Spectral Diffusion in Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectra via the Projection Slice Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust and streamlined method is presented for efficiently extracting spectral diffusion from two-dimensional coherent spectra by employing the projection-slice theorem. The method is based on the optical Bloch equations for a single resonance that include a Frequency-Frequency Correlation Function (FFCF) in the time domain. Through the projection slice theorem (PST), analytical formulation of the diagonal and cross-diagonal projections of time-domain two-dimensional spectra are calculated that include the FFCF for arbitrary inhomogeneity. The time-domain projections are Fourier transformed to provide frequency domain slices that can be fit to slices of experimental spectra. Experimental data is used to validate our lineshape analysis and confirm the need for the inclusion of the FFCF for quantum wells that experience spectral diffusion.</description>

      <title>Classically Prepared, Quantumly Evolved: Hybrid Algorithm for Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to compute dynamical correlation functions and excitation spectra in many-body quantum systems, with a focus on molecular systems. The method combines classical preparation of a perturbed ground state with short-time quantum evolution of product states sampled from it. The resulting quantum samples define an effective subspace of the Hilbert space, onto which the Hamiltonian is projected to enable efficient classical simulation of long-time dynamics. This subspace-based approach achieves high-resolution spectral reconstruction using shallow circuits and few samples. Benchmarks on molecular systems show excellent agreement with exact diagonalization and demonstrate access to dynamical timescales beyond the reach of purely classical methods, highlighting its suitability for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Timescale Barrier: Generative Discovery of Conformational Free-Energy Landscapes and Transition Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular transitions -- such as protein folding, allostery, and membrane transport -- are central to biology yet remain notoriously difficult to simulate. Their intrinsic rarity pushes them beyond reach of standard molecular dynamics, while enhanced-sampling methods are costly and often depend on arbitrary variables that bias outcomes. We introduce Gen-COMPAS, a generative committor-guided path sampling framework that reconstructs transition pathways without predefined variables and at a fraction of the cost. Gen-COMPAS couples a generative diffusion model, which produces physically realistic intermediates, with committor-based filtering to pinpoint transition states. Short unbiased simulations from these intermediates rapidly yield full transition-path ensembles that converge within nanoseconds, where conventional methods require orders of magnitude more sampling. Applied to systems from a miniprotein to a ribose-binding protein to a mitochondrial carrier, Gen-COMPAS retrieves committors, transition states, and free-energy landscapes efficiently, uniting machine learning and molecular dynamics for broad mechanistic and practical insight.</description>

      <title>The Phase-Coupled Caldeira-Leggett Model: Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics beyond Linear Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \textit{Phase-Coupled Caldeira-Leggett} (PCL) model of quantum dissipation and develop an exact framework for its dynamics. Unlike the conventional Caldeira-Leggett model with linear system-bath coupling $H_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto\hat F$, the PCL model features an exponential interaction $H_{\mathrm{SB}}\propto e^{i\lambda \hat F}$, where $\hat F$ denotes the collective bath coordinate. This model unifies concepts from quantum Brownian motion and polaron physics, providing a general platform to study phase-mediated dissipation and decoherence beyond the linear-response regime. Despite its nonlinear system-bath coupling, the Gaussian nature of the environment allows a nonperturbative and non-Markovian treatment of PCL model within the algebra of dissipative quasiparticles. We obtain an exact closed-form equation of motion for the reduced density operator, and numerical simulations reveal distinctive dynamical behaviors that deviate markedly from those predicted by the conventional Caldeira-Leggett model.</description>

      <title>The Microscopic Nature of Orbital Disorder in LaMnO$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a revised atomistic picture of the order-disorder transition in the archetypal orbital-ordered perovskite material, LaMnO$_{3}$. Our study uses machine-learning-driven molecular-dynamics simulations which describe the temperature evolution of pair distribution functions in close agreement with experiment. We find the orbital-disordered phase in LaMnO$_{3}$ to comprise a mixture of differing structural distortions with and without inversion symmetry, implying a mixture of different orbital arrangements. These distortions are highly dynamic with an estimated lifetime of $\sim 40$ fs at 1,000 K, and their fluctuations converge with the timescales of conventional thermal motion in the high-$T$ phase - indicating that the electronic instability responsible for static Jahn-Teller distortions at low temperature instead drives phonon anharmonicity at high temperatures. Beyond LaMnO$_{3}$, our work opens an avenue for studying a wider range of correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Associative and Segregative Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation in Macromolecular Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and interfacial properties of two LLPS modes: associative (ALLPS) and segregative (SLLPS). Analytical expressions for the critical point (CP) and binodal boundaries are derived and show excellent agreement with self-consistent field (SCF) lattice computations. Distinct thermodynamic features differentiate ALLPS from SLLPS: (1) in ALLPS, polymers co-concentrate within a single dense phase coexisting with a solvent-rich phase, whereas in SLLPS each polymer forms a separate phase; (2) the attractive interaction per monomer in ALLPS is strongly dependent on solvent quality, but solvent-independent in SLLPS; and (3) ALLPS binodals exhibit near-universal behavior, largely independent of solvent content. SCF results further show that interfacial tension increases and interfacial width decreases with distance from the CP. We provide scaling relations for both quantities are provided. Compared with SLLPS, ALLPS displays higher interfacial tension and a thinner interface, reflecting distinct molecular organization at the liquid-liquid boundary.</description>

Abstract: The GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism is a well-established approach for calculating excitation energies and optical spectra of molecules, nanostructures, and crystalline materials. We implement GW-BSE in the CP2K code and validate the implementation for a standard organic molecular test set, obtaining excellent agreement with reference data, with a mean absolute error in excitation energies below 3 meV. We then study optical spectra of nanographenes of increasing length, showing excellent agreement with experiment. We further compute the size of the excitation of the lowest optically active excitation which converges to about 7.6 $\r{A}$ with increasing length. Comparison with time-dependent density functional theory using functionals of varying exact-exchange fraction shows that none reproduce both the size of the excitation and optical spectra of GW-BSE, underscoring the need for many-body methods for accurate description of electronic excitations in nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of actinide chemistry: towards scalable algorithms on trapped ion quantum computers</title>

Abstract: Due to the wide range of technical applications of actinide elements, a thorough understanding of their electronic structure could complement technological improvements in many different areas. Quantum computing could greatly aid in this understanding, as it can potentially provide exponential speedups over classical approaches, thereby offering insights into the complex electronic structure of actinide compounds. As a first foray into quantum computational chemistry of actinides, this paper compares the method of quantum computed moments (QCM) as a noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithm with a single-ancilla version of quantum phase estimation (QPE), a quantum algorithm expected to run on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We employ these algorithms to study the reaction energetics of plutonium oxides and hydrides. In order to enable quantum hardware experiments, we use several techniques to reduce resource requirements: screening individual Hamiltonian Pauli terms to reduce the measurement requirements of QCM and variational compilation to reduce the depth of QPE circuits. Finally, we derive electronic structure descriptions from a series of representative chemical models and compute the energetics from quantum experiments on Quantinuum's H-series ion trap devices using up to 19 qubits. We find our experiments to be in excellent agreement with results from classical electronic structure calculations and state vector simulations.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of seeded protein aggregation: theory and application</title>

Abstract: ``Seeding'' is the addition of preformed fibrils to a solution of monomeric protein to accelerate its aggregation into new fibrils. It is a versatile and widely-used tool for scientists studying protein aggregation kinetics, as it enables the isolation and separate study of discrete reaction steps contributing to protein aggregation, specifically elongation and secondary nucleation. However, the seeding levels required to achieve dominating effects on each of these steps separately have been established largely by trial-and-error, due in part to the lack of availability of integrated rate laws valid for moderate to high seeding levels and generally applicable to all common underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, we improve on a recently developed mathematical method based on Lie symmetries for solving differential equations, and with it derive such an integrated rate law. We subsequently develop simple expressions for the amounts of seed required to isolate each step. We rationalize the empirical observation that fibril seeds must often be broken up into small pieces to successfully isolate elongation. We also derive expressions for average fibril lengths at different times in the aggregation reaction, and explore different methods to break up fibrils. This paper will provide an invaluable reference for future experimental and theoretical studies in which seeding techniques are employed, and should enable more sophisticated analyses than have been performed to date.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has transformed our ability to investigate and understand electronic ground states. In its original formulation, however, DFT is not suited to addressing (e.g.) degenerate ground states, mixed states with different particle numbers, or excited states. All these issues can be handled, in principle exactly, via ensemble DFT (EDFT). This Perspective provides a detailed introduction to and analysis of EDFT, in an in-principle exact framework that is constructed to avoid uncontrolled errors and inconsistencies that may be associated with {\it ad hoc} extensions of conventional DFT. In particular, it focuses on the "ensemblization" of both exact and approximate density functionals, a term we coin to describe a rigorous approach that lends itself to the construction of novel approximations consistent with the general ensemble framework, yet applicable to practical problems where traditional DFT tends to fail or does not apply at all. Specifically, symmetry considerations and ensemble properties are shown to enable each other in shaping a practical DFT-based methodology that extends beyond the ground state and, in doing so, highlights the need to look outside the standard ground state Kohn-Sham treatment.</description>

      <title>Silk-Nano-Fibroin Aerogels: A Bio-Derived, Amine-Rich Platform for Rapid and Reversible CO2 Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01129v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in bio-based materials, rapid, low-temperature CO2 capture using amine-rich natural sorbents has received limited attention. In recent years, various porous solid sorbents have drawn significant research interest as promising carbon capture materials. However, high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, sluggish adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain major challenges for their practical implementation. Here, we present silk-nano-fibroin aerogels derived from natural mulberry silk as a sustainable, amine-rich, and support-free sorbent platform for energy-efficient CO2 capture. The aerogels exhibit a CO2 adsorption capacity competitive with state-of-the-art amino acid and amino acid ionic liquid-based solid sorbents. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms high thermal stability up to 250C, substantially higher than that of conventional amine sorbents, while complete sorbent regeneration occurs at only 60 C. Furthermore, the silk-nano-fibroin aerogels demonstrate rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, excellent multicycle stability, and full retention of CO2 adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Spectroscopic analyses (XPS, FTIR, Raman, and solid-state 13C NMR) confirm reversible CO2 chemisorption through intrinsic amine sites within the silk-fibroin backbone. Overall, this work establishes silk-nano-fibroin aerogels as a sustainable and low-cost route toward energy-efficient CO2 capture.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Direct Prediction of Molecular Dynamics Across Chemical Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of atomistic systems, but its reliance on sequential numerical integration limits simulation efficiency. We present a novel neural network architecture, MDtrajNet, and a pre-trained foundational model, MDtrajNet-1, that directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet combines equivariant neural networks with a transformer-based architecture to achieve strong accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated by MDtrajNet-1 for various known and unseen molecular systems are close to those of the conventional ab initio MD. The architecture's flexible design supports diverse application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary conditions, and interaction types. By overcoming the intrinsic speed barrier of conventional MD, MDtrajNet opens new frontiers in efficient and scalable atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Flow matching for reaction pathway generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating reaction mechanisms hinges on efficiently generating transition states (TSs), products, and complete reaction networks. Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.</description>

      <title>Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study many-body correlation functions within various Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) formulations and compare their predictions to Monte Carlo simulations of hard-sphere fluids. FMT accurately captures the qualitative behavior of three- and four-body structure, particularly at low and intermediate wavevectors. At higher wavevectors, the predictions of FMT vary in quantitative accuracy. We show that the dominant contributions to the four-point structure factor arise from direct triplet correlations, allowing the evaluation of four-point correlations to be greatly simplified. In glass-forming liquids at high volume fractions, FMT correctly reproduces deviations from the convolution approximation, highlighting FMT's ability to capture growing structural multipoint correlations upon supercooling.</description>

      <title>Seniority-zero Linear Canonical Transformation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for strongly correlated systems by applying a unitary transformation to reduce the complexity of the physical Hamiltonian. In particular, we seek a transformation that maps the Hamiltonian into the seniority-zero space: seniority-zero wavefunctions are computationally simpler, but still capture strong correlation within electron pairs. The unitary rotation is evaluated using the Baker Campbell Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, truncated to two-body operators through the operator decomposition strategy of canonical transformation (CT) theory, which rewrites higher-rank terms approximately in terms of one- and two-body operators. Unlike conventional approaches to CT theory, the generator is chosen to minimize the size of non-seniority-zero elements of the transformed Hamiltonian. Numerical tests reveal that this Seniority-zero Linear Canonical Transformation (SZ-LCT) method delivers highly accurate results, usually with submilliHartree error. The effective computational scaling of SZ-LCT is $\mathcal{O}(N^8/n_c)$ , where $n_c$ is the number of cores available for the computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale morphological evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no version of this approach that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. Leveraging molecular coarse-graining, we describe the formulation of an order parameter-based free energy functional appropriate for a phase-field description via the enhanced sampling of rare events. We demonstrate our approach on ice nucleation dynamics, achieving a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models and systematically bridges the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

      <title>To jump or not to jump: Adhesion and viscous dissipation dictate the detachment of coalescing wall-attached bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubble coalescence can promote bubble departure at much smaller sizes compared to buoyancy. This can critically enhance the efficiency of gas-evolving electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. In this study, we integrate high-speed imaging experiments and direct numerical simulations to dissect how and under which conditions bubble coalescence on surfaces leads to detachment. Our transparent electrode experiments provide new insights into contact line dynamics, demonstrating that the bubble neck generally does not contact the surface during coalescence. We reveal that whether coalescence leads to bubble departure or not is determined by the balance between surface energy, adhesion forces, and viscous dissipation. For the previously unexplored regime at low effective Ohnesorge number, a measure of viscosity that incorporates the effect of asymmetry between the coalescing bubbles, we identify a critical dimensionless adhesion energy threshold of $\approx$15% of the released surface energy, below which bubbles typically detach. We develop a global energy balance model that successfully predicts coalescence outcomes across diverse experimental conditions.</description>
