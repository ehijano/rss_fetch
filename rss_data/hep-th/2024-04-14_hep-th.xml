      <title>A non-Perturbative and Background-Independent Formulation of Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-perturbative and background-independent quantum formulation of quadratic gravity is provided. A canonical quantization procedure introduced in previous works, named after Dirac and Pauli, is here applied to quadratic gravity to obtain, as required by consistency, a well-defined Euclidean path integral. The theory is unitary: all probabilities are non negative and they sum up to one. We obtain path-integral expressions for the transition amplitudes, Green's functions and generic matrix elements of time-ordered products of the metric. As a byproduct, similar results are also obtained for a scalar-field four-derivative interacting model. In this way, among other things, previous perturbative and background-dependent calculations are justified. The (quantum) quadratic gravity effective action, whose field equations determine the vacuum expectation value of the metric in the presence of a generic energy-momentum tensor, is constructed. The classical limit of the effective action turns out to be equivalent to the starting classical action of quadratic gravity, whose runaway rates were previously shown to be slow enough to be compatible with observations. Finally, the constructed non-perturbative and background-independent quantum quadratic gravity is applied to quantum cosmology to obtain a path-integral expression for the wave function of the universe, which satisfies a sort of Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This application allows us to understand at the quantum level why our universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic.</description>

      <title>On the Class $\mathcal{S}$ Origin of Spindle Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the backreacted geometry corresponding to a stack of M5-branes wrapped on a spindle, with a view towards precision tests of the dual $\mathcal{N} = 1$ superconformal field theory. We carefully study the singular loci of the uplifted geometry and show that these correspond to $\mathbf{C}^3/\mathbf{Z}_n$ conical singularities. Therefore, these solutions present one of the first explicit realisations of honest locally $\mathcal{N} = 1$ preserving punctures in class $\mathcal{S}$. Additionally, we study the symmetries and anomalies of the dual field theory through anomaly inflow and compute a variety of holographic observables including dimensions of BPS operators. This work paves the way for advancements in the study and identification of the precise dual field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This introductory work combines bottom-up and top-down approaches towards understanding the underlying categorical structure of possible unifying theories descending from string theory. Guided by well-established developments in the realm of categorical algebraic geometry, we explain why abelianisation could potentially lead to furthering the understanding of how to embed Beyond the Standard Model scenarios in supersymmetric setups.</description>

      <title>Brane expansions for anti-symmetric line operator index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the D5-brane realization of Wilson line operators in anti-symmetric representations, we propose brane expansion formulas for $I_{N,k}$, the Schur index of ${\cal N}=4$ $U(N)$ SYM decorated by line operators in the anti-symmetric representation of rank $k$. For the large $N$ index $I_{\infty,k}$ we propose a double-sum expansion, and for finite $N$ index $I_{N,k}$ we propose a quadruple-sum expansion. Objects causing finite $k$ and finite $N$ corrections are disk D3-branes ending on the D5-brane.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

      <title>Floquet SYK wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>

      <title>Conformal field theory with composite defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore higher-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) in the presence of a conformal defect that itself hosts another sub-dimensional defect. We refer to this new kind of conformal defect as the composite defect. We elaborate on the various conformal properties of the composite defect CFTs, including correlation functions, operator expansions, and conformal block expansions. As an example, we present a free O(N) vector model in the presence of a composite defect. Assuming the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) does hold even for the defect systems, we conclude that some boundary conditions can be excluded. Our investigations shed light on the rich phenomenology arising from hierarchical defect structures, paving the way for a deeper understanding of critical phenomena in nature.</description>

      <title>A new SU(2/1) supergroup with determinant 1 explains many mysteries of the weak interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taken as a classification paradigm completing the standard model, a new compact form of the SU(2/1) supergroup explains many mysterious properties of the weak interactions: the maximal breaking of parity, the fractional charges of the quarks, the cancellation of the quantum field theory anomalies, and ties together the existence of the right neutrinos and of the heavier Fermions. This compact supergroup is constructed by exponentiating the matrices representing the leptons and the quarks which form a semi-direct sum of Kac modules of the real superalgebra su(2/1,R) such that the overall trace of the $U(1)$ weak-hypercharge $Y$ vanishes. Remarkably, all the elements of this supergroup have Berezinian 1 and determinant 1. In practice, $Tr(Y)=0$ simply means that the electric charge of the hydrogen atom is zero.</description>

      <title>See the lightning, hear the thunder: quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the ``thunder'') and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the ``lightning'') BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that modular symmetry may solve the strong CP problem without axions, by producing a vanishing QCD angle while generating a large quark CP violation phase. We extend this framework to finite modular groups, systematically identifying the allowed mass textures. We find quark fields must furnish 1D representations and scan the minimal model landscape.</description>

Abstract: We reveal that the information exchange between particle detectors and their ability to harvest correlations from a quantum field can interfere constructively and destructively. This allows for scenarios where the presence of entanglement in the quantum field is actually detrimental to the process of getting the two detectors entangled.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Quantum Many-body Chaos in the Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of simple operators is essential for the emergence of chaotic dynamics and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have proposed different measures, including the out-of-time-order correlator and Krylov complexity. It is established that the out-of-time-order correlator serves as the signature of quantum many-body chaos, while the Krylov complexity provides its upper bound. However, there exist non-chaotic systems in which Krylov complexity grows exponentially, indicating that the Krylov complexity itself is not a witness of many-body chaos. In this letter, we introduce the missing ingredient, named as the Krylov metric $K_{mn}$, which probes the size of the Krylov basis. We propose that the universal criteria for fast scramblers include (i) the exponential growth of Krylov complexity, (ii) the diagonal elements $K_{nn}\sim n^h$ with $h\in(0,1]$, and (iii) the negligibility of off-diagonal elements $K_{mn}$ with $m\neq n$. We further show that $h=\varkappa / 2\alpha$ is a ratio between the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\varkappa$ and the Krylov exponent $\alpha$. This proposal is supported by both generic arguments and explicit examples, including solvable SYK models, Luttinger Liquids, and many-body localized systems. Our results provide a refined understanding of how chaotic dynamics emerge from the Krylov space perspective.</description>

Abstract: We present a pedagogical treatment of the electroweak Higgs mechanism based solely on Feynman diagrams and S-matrix elements, without recourse to (gauge) symmetry arguments. Throughout, the emphasis is on Feynman rules and the Schwinger-Dyson equations; it is pointed out that particular care is needed in the treatment of tadpole diagrams and their symmetry factors.</description>

      <title>Influence of the cosmological constant on $\kappa$-deformed Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model of the neutron star in $\kappa$-deformed space-time in the presence of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$). The Einstein tensor and the energy-momentum tensor are generalized to $\kappa$-deformed space-time and we construct the field equations with the cosmological constant. Considering the interior of the star to be a perfect fluid as in the commutative case, we find the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with the inclusion of the cosmological constant in $\kappa$-deformed space-time. The behavior of the maximum allowed mass of the star and its radius are studied with the variation in the cosmological constant as well as the deformation parameter. We see that the non-commutativity enhances the mass of the star and its maximum mass increases with a decrease in the cosmological constant. The maximum mass varies from $3.44M_{\odot}$ to $3.68M_{\odot}$ as $\Lambda$ varies from $10^{-10}m^{-2}$ to $10^{-15}m^{-2}$. We also obtain the compactness factor and surface redshift of the star. We observe that the compactness of the star increases as the cosmological constant decreases, whereas the surface redshift of the star decreases with a decrease in the cosmological constant. The compactness factor and surface redshift corresponding to the maximum mass of the neutron star remains almost constant as $\Lambda$ decreases.</description>

      <title>Towards a spatial cat state of a massive pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experiment for constructing a spatial cat state of a suspended mirror with an order of $\mathcal{O}$(mg). The mirror is set at the center of two mirrors, creating two optical cavities and optical springs. The induced potential exhibits a double-well shape, and its deformation resembles a second-order phase transition as a function of laser power. We estimate an adiabatic condition for the ground state wave function to metamorphose from a localized state at the origin to a spatial cat state within the double-well potential, within a coherence time determined by mechanical and environmental noises. Our estimation suggests that such a construction is possible if we can provide an ultra-high finesse optical cavity with $F = 2.5 \times 10^5$ and a length of $0.3$ cm, along with a shot-noise-limited laser at $7.9$ nW. The necessary mechanical coherence time is approximately one second.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the concept of the curvature in the momentum space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the history of the curved momentum space from Max Born to the recent relative locality, \k{appa}-Poincare and noncommutative geometric proposals. We found that the concept of the curvature in the momentum space and motivations has been evolved during 80 years from the Max Born time. Motivations has been evolved from introducing general relativistic like equation for the momentum space to the relaxation of the concept of locality in special relativity and non-commutativity. This study can help us for a better understanding of this concept in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid pase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized dc conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arise under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from collapsing antimatter</title>

      <description>arXiv:1704.01750v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper a simple (i.e. free of fine-tuning, etc.) new mechanism for primordial black hole formation based on the collapse of large antimatter systems in the early Universe is introduced. A peculiarity of this process is that, compared to their material counterparts, the collapse of large antimatter systems takes much less time due to the reversed thermodynamics of antimatter, an idea which has been proposed in our earlier paper.
  This model has several testable predictions. The first is that the photon-baryon ratio is roughly computable and is equal to $1.95\times 10^9$ which is quite close to its experimentally confirmed value. The second is that the mass of black holes arising from this mechanism is at least $10^5$-$10^6M_\odot$ hence they contribute to the super- or hypermassive end of the primordial black hole mass spectrum. The third prediction is that these sort of primordial black holes constitute at least $20\%$ of dark matter. Last but not least the observed current asymmetry of matter and antimatter, even if their presence in the Universe was symmetric in the beginning, acquires a natural explanation, too.</description>

Abstract: Recently in arXiv:2012.05599 Rudenko presented a formula for the volume of hyperbolic orthoschemes in terms of alternating polylogarithms. We use this result to provide an explicit analytic result for the one-loop scalar n-gon Feynman integral in n dimensions, for even n, with massless or massive internal and external edges. Furthermore, we evaluate the general six-dimensional hexagon integral in terms of classical polylogarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the work of [2008.03319], we define a generally covariant max-entanglement wedge of a boundary region $B$, which we conjecture to be the bulk region reconstructible from $B$. We similarly define a covariant min-entanglement wedge, which we conjecture to be the bulk region that can influence the state on $B$. We prove that the min- and max-entanglement wedges obey various properties necessary for this conjecture, such as nesting, inclusion of the causal wedge, and a reduction to the usual quantum extremal surface prescription in the appropriate special cases. These proofs rely on one-shot versions of the (restricted) quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) that we conjecture to hold. We argue that these QFCs imply a one-shot generalized second law (GSL) and quantum Bousso bound. Moreover, in a particular semiclassical limit we prove this one-shot GSL directly using algebraic techniques. Finally, in order to derive our results, we extend both the frameworks of one-shot quantum Shannon theory and state-specific reconstruction to finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras, allowing nontrivial centers.</description>

      <title>Creation of Bound Half-Fermion Pairs by Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of topologically nontrivial bosonic field configurations, the fermion number operator may take on fractional eigenvalues, because of the existence of zero-energy fermion modes. The simplest examples of this occur in 1+1 dimensions, with zero modes attached to kink-type solitons. In the presence of a kink-antikink pair, the two associated zero modes bifurcate into positive and negative energy levels with energies $\pm ge^{-g\Delta}$, in terms of the Yukawa coupling $g\ll 1$ and the distance $\Delta$ between the kink and antikink centers. When the kink and antikink are moving, it seems that there could be Landau-Zener-like transitions between these two fermionic modes, which would be interpretable as the creation or annihilation of fermion-antifermion pairs; however, with only two solitons in relative motion, this does not occur. If a third solitary wave is introduced farther away to perturb the kink-antikink system, a movement of the faraway kink can induce transitions between the discrete fermion modes bound to the solitons. These state changes can be interpreted globally as creation or destruction of a novel type of pair: a half-fermion and a half-antifermion. The production of the half-integral pairs will dominate over other particle production channels as long as the solitary waves remain well separated, so that there is a manifold of discrete fermion states whose energies are either zero or exponentially close to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Superconformal anomalies from superconformal Chern-Simons polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the 4-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ Lie superconformal algebra and search for completely "symmetric" (in the graded sense) 3-index invariant tensors. The solution we find is unique and we show that the corresponding invariant polynomial cubic in the generalized curvatures of superconformal gravity vanishes. Consequently, the associated Chern-Simons polynomial is a non-trivial anomaly cocycle. We explicitly compute this cocycle to all orders in the independent fields of superconformal gravity and establish that it is BRST equivalent to the so-called superconformal $a$-anomaly. We briefly discuss the possibility that the superconformal $c$-anomaly also admits a similar Chern-Simons formulation and the potential holographic, 5-dimensional, interpretation of our results.</description>

Abstract: We continue the study of 4-dimensional Schwarzschild de Sitter black holes in the regime where the black hole mass is small compared with the de Sitter scale, following arXiv:2207.10724 [hep-th]. The de Sitter temperature is very low compared with that of the black hole. We consider the future boundary as the location where the black hole Hawking radiation is collected. Using 2-dimensional tools, we find unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy of radiation as the radiation region approaches the entire future boundary. Self-consistently including appropriate late time islands emerging just inside the black hole horizon leads to a reasonable Page curve. We also discuss other potential island solutions which show inconsistencies.</description>

Abstract: For QFTs in AdS the boundary correlation functions remain conformal even if the bulk theory has a scale. This allows one to constrain RG flows with numerical conformal bootstrap methods. We apply this idea to flows between two-dimensional CFTs, focusing on deformations of the tricritical and ordinary Ising model. We provide non-perturbative constraints for the boundary correlation functions of these flows and compare them with conformal perturbation theory in the vicinity of the fixed points. We also reproduce a completely general constraint on the sign of the $T\bar T$ deformation in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Dark Dimension, the Swampland, and the Dark Matter Fraction Composed of Primordial Near-Extremal Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent publication we studied the decay rate of primordial black holes perceiving the dark dimension, an innovative five-dimensional (5D) scenario that has a compact space with characteristic length-scale in the micron range. We demonstrated that the rate of Hawking radiation of 5D black holes slows down compared to 4D black holes of the same mass. Armed with our findings we showed that for a species scale of ${\cal O} (10^{9}~{\rm GeV})$, an all-dark-matter interpretation in terms of primordial black holes should be feasible for black hole masses in the range $10^{14} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$. As a natural outgrowth of our recent study, herein we calculate the Hawking evaporation of near-extremal 5D black holes. Using generic entropy arguments we demonstrate that Hawking evaporation of higher-dimensional near-extremal black holes proceeds at a slower rate than the corresponding Schwarzschild black holes of the same mass. Assisted by this result we show that if there were 5D primordial near-extremal black holes in nature, then a PBH all-dark-matter interpretation would be possible in the mass range $10^{7}\sqrt{\beta} \lesssim M/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$, where $\beta$ is a parameter that controls the difference between mass and charge of the associated near-extremal black hole.</description>

Abstract: We study correlation functions of spectrally-flowed vertex operators in bosonic string theory on $\text{AdS}_3\times X$ in the path integral formalism. By restricting the path integral to only include worldsheets which live near the asymptotic boundary, we compute correlation functions of spectrally-flowed vertex operators and find a precise agreement with the perturbative correlators in the recently-proposed dual CFT at all orders in conformal perturbation theory. We thus provide highly nontrivial evidence for the bulk/boundary duality.</description>

Abstract: We derive a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model from a non-local gauge theory and show that it has confining properties at low energies. In particular, we present an extended approach to non-local QCD and a complete revision of the technique of Bender, Milton and Savage applied to non-local theories, providing a set of Dyson--Schwinger equations in differential form. In the local case, we obtain closed form solutions in the simplest case of the scalar field and extend it to the Yang--Mills field. In general, for non-local theories, we use a perturbative technique and a Fourier series and show how higher-order harmonics are heavily damped due to the presence of the non-local factor. The spectrum of the theory is analysed for the non-local Yang--Mills sector and found to be in agreement with the local results on the lattice in the limit of the non-locality mass parameter running to infinity. In the non-local case, we confine ourselves to a non-locality mass that is sufficiently large compared to the mass scale arising from the integration of the Dyson--Schwinger equations. Such a choice results in good agreement, in the proper limit, with the spectrum of the local theory. We derive the gap equation for the fermions in the theory that gives some indication of quark confinement in the non-local NJL case as well. Confinement seems to be a rather ubiquitous effect that removes some degrees of freedom in the original action, favouring the appearance of new observable states, as seen, e.g.,\ for quantum chromodynamics at lower energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the Lorentzian gravitational path integral in the presence of non-vanishing torsion with the application of the Picard-Lefschetz theory for minisuperspaces corresponding to a number of phenomenological bouncing cosmological models as well as for the inflationary paradigm. It turns out that the semi-classical wave function derived from the saddle points of the path integral formalism coincides with the solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Intriguingly, our analysis showed that the relative probability, derived using these semi-classical wave functions favors universes with smaller values of torsion. Moreover, we find that in the inflationary case, non-zero values of a certain parity-violating component of the torsion enhance the power in the large physical length scales, which can have important observational implications. On the other hand, in the case of bouncing models, the power spectrum is characterized by an initial region of growth, an intermediate oscillatory region, and then again a final region of growth. The shape of the power spectrum in the initial and intermediate regions is sensitive to the abundance of the bounce-enabling matter and torsion, along with the initial wave function of the universe, while the final size modifies the behavior of the power spectrum in the smaller length scales.</description>

      <title>Constraining an Early Dark Energy Motivated Quintessential $\alpha$-Attractor Inflaton Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new model of quintessential $\alpha$ attractor inflation in conjunction with the features of non-oscillating early dark energy (EDE). Slow-roll plateau of this model is obtained, and analyzed in $k$-space, through the inflaton field and its first-order perturbation over a quasi de-Sitter metric fluctuation in the range $k=0.001-0.009$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The estimated cosmological parameters are found to obey Planck+BICEP2/Keck bounds with $68\%$ CL with the required trend of spectral tilts in the $n_s-r$ parametric space. We verify that, the inclusion of the EDE does not significantly affect the observed parameters. Its presence manifests in obtaining \textit{improved values} of the energy scale of inflation ($M$) and the present-day vacuum density ($V_{\Lambda}$). They are found to be $M=5.58\times 10^{-4}-4.57\times 10^{-3} M_P$ and $V_{\Lambda}=1.042\times 10^{-119}-4.688\times 10^{-116} M_P^4$.
  However, the $\alpha$-parameter is drastically constrained in two ways. Its lower end is fixed by the consistency analysis of the $k$-mode equations, while the upper end is evaluated as a derived expression of $\alpha$-cut-off through the aspects of EDE \textit{viz.,} the effects of \textit{Enhanced Symmetry Point} (ESP) in the potential during inflation. Improvised range of $\alpha$ is found to be $0.001\leq\alpha&lt;0.1$ for the model parameters $\gamma$ and $n$ lying within $0.01\leq\gamma\leq 0.09$ and $8\leq n\leq 10$ respectively. These ranges are shown to be essential for satisfying the COBE/Planck normalized energy scale of inflation and the Planck-value of present-day vacuum density. If we choose $\gamma=0.0818$ and $n=8$, then we get $0.001\leq\alpha\leq 0.0186$. Thus, the lower and upper limits of $\alpha$ are diminished substantially, compared with those in the earlier studies.</description>

Abstract: We study the origin of the global $B-L$ symmetry in a class of flavor-unified theories with gauge groups of ${\rm SU}(N\geq 6)$. In particular, we focus on the ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory which can minimally embed three-generational SM fermions non-trivially. A reformulation of the third law for the flavor sector proposed by Georgi is useful to manifest the underlying global symmetries. The 't Hooft anomaly matching and the generalized neutrality conditions for Higgs fields play the key roles in defining the $B-L$ symmetry. Based on the global $B-L$ symmetry, we count the Higgs fields that can develop the VEVs and the massless sterile neutrinos in the ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory. We also prove that a global $B-L$ symmetry can always be defined in any ${\rm SU}(N\geq 6)$ theory when it is spontaneously broken to the SM gauge symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general formulation of quantum statistical mechanics in terms of probability currents that satisfy continuity equations in the multi-particle position space, for closed and open systems with a fixed number of particles. The continuity equation for any closed or open system suggests a natural Bohmian interpretation in terms of microscopic particle trajectories, that make the same measurable predictions as standard quantum theory. The microscopic trajectories are not directly observable, but provide a general, simple and intuitive microscopic interpretation of macroscopic phenomena in quantum statistical mechanics. In particular, we discuss how various notions of entropy, proper and improper mixtures, and thermodynamics are understood from the Bohmian perspective.</description>

      <title>A study about black hole solutions with nonconstant transversal curvature and its conserved charges in Lovelock gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the analysis of some new static black hole solutions of Lovelock gravity with nonconstant curvature transverse section is presented. It will be shown that the finiteness of the charges and the action principle rely on the existence of constraints on the geometry of the transverse sections. Finally, in this context, some new sound solutions with nonconstant curvature transverse sections that deviate from the previously known geometries are discussed.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and scalar spectral index: Reconstructing inflation and reheating in a non-canonical theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we analyze the reconstruction of inflation in the framework of a non-canonical theory. In this sense, we study the viability of reconstructing the background variables assuming a non-lineal kinetic term given by $K(X,\phi)=X+g(\phi)X^2$, with $X$ the standard kinetic term associated to the scalar field $\phi$ and $g(\phi)$ an arbitrary coupling function. In order to achieve this reconstruction in the context of inflation, we assume the slow-roll approximation together with the parametrization of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of the number of $e-$folds $N$. By assuming the simplest parametrizations for $n_s-1=-2/N$ and $c_s\propto N^{-\beta}$ with $\beta$ a constant, we find the reconstruction of the effective potential $V(\phi)$ and the coupling function $g(\phi)$ in terms of the scalar field. Besides, we study the reheating epoch by considering a constant equation of state parameter, where we determine the temperature and number of $e-$folds during the reheating epoch in terms of the reconstructed variables and the observational parameters. In this way, the parameter-space related to the reconstructed inflationary model are constrained during the epochs of inflation and reheating by assuming the current astronomical data from Planck and BICEP/Keck results.</description>

      <title>On the entropy corrected thermal features of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the thermal properties of black holes using a new class of generalized entropy functions [K. Ourabah, Class. Quantum Grav., 41, 015010 (2024)]. At the fundamental level, these entropic forms are associated with alternative gravitational laws, within an entropic gravity framework. Our investigation revolves around three distinct entropy functions associated with the Yukawa Potential Correction, Non-local Gravity Correction, and Gradient Field Gravity Correction. Through comparative analysis, we study how such entropic constructs impact the thermodynamic behavior of black holes. For each case, we derive the stability thermodynamic conditions associated with the respective entropic constructs.</description>

      <title>Probing Baryogenesis in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of matter domination in the Universe is one of the most exciting open puzzles in particle physics and cosmology. Despite many theoretical developments, the actual reason behind baryon-antibaryon asymmetry is still unknown. Our aim here is to examine this phenomenon in the framework of modified gravity theories, which have impressively elucidated the contemporary accelerated expansion of the universe as well as the early phase. Consequently, this letter sets its sights on the task of constraining a specific variant of modified gravity, namely, $f(Q)$ gravity, in conjunction with gravitational baryogenesis. The Power Law model and recently proposed DGP-like $f(Q)$ models are considered to find the baryon-to-entropy ratio and compare them with the observed value, that is ${n_B}/s=9.42\times 10^{-11}$. Furthermore, we impose constraints on the additional degrees of freedom introduced by this modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain five popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$ indicating a beyond $2\sigma$ evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrink the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy implying that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and give a clue of massive sterile neutrinos via the $2\sigma$ constraint on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3.16^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ and the effective mass $m^{eff}_{\nu, sterile}&lt;0.52$ eV. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter, dark energy and neutrinos, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Isotropic Universe in RQM Analogy: the Cosmological Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>
