      <title>Advanced Digital Simulation for Financial Market Dynamics: A Case of Commodity Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decades of evolution, the financial system has increasingly deviated from an idealized framework based on theorems. It necessitates accurate projections of complex market dynamics and human behavioral patterns. With the development of data science and machine intelligence, researchers are trying to digitalize and automate market prediction. However, existing methodologies struggle to represent the diversity of individuals and are regardless of the domino effects of interactions on market dynamics, leading to the poor performance facing abnormal market conditions where non-quantitative information dominates the market. To alleviate these disadvantages requires the introduction of knowledge about how non-quantitative information, like news and policy, affects market dynamics. This study investigates overcoming these challenges through rehearsing potential market trends based on the financial large language model agents whose behaviors are aligned with their cognition and analyses in markets. We propose a hierarchical knowledge architecture for financial large language model agents, integrating fine-tuned language models and specialized generators optimized for trading scenarios. For financial market, we develop an advanced interactive behavioral simulation system that enables users to configure agents and automate market simulations. In this work, we take commodity futures as an example to research the effectiveness of our methodologies. Our real-world case simulation succeeds in rehearsing abnormal market dynamics under geopolitical events and reaches an average accuracy of 3.4% across various points in time after the event on predicting futures price. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively leverages diverse information to simulate behaviors and their impact on market dynamics through systematic interaction.</description>

      <title>From Deep Learning to LLMs: A survey of AI in Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative investment (quant) is an emerging, technology-driven approach in asset management, increasingy shaped by advancements in artificial intelligence. Recent advances in deep learning and large language models (LLMs) for quant finance have improved predictive modeling and enabled agent-based automation, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in this field. In this survey, taking alpha strategy as a representative example, we explore how AI contributes to the quantitative investment pipeline. We first examine the early stage of quant research, centered on human-crafted features and traditional statistical models with an established alpha pipeline. We then discuss the rise of deep learning, which enabled scalable modeling across the entire pipeline from data processing to order execution. Building on this, we highlight the emerging role of LLMs in extending AI beyond prediction, empowering autonomous agents to process unstructured data, generate alphas, and support self-iterative workflows.</description>
