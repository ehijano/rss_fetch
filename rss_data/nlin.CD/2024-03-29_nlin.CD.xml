      <title>Synchronization dynamics of phase oscillators on power grid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate topological and spectral properties of models of European and US-American power grids and of paradigmatic network models as well as their implications for the synchronization dynamics of phase oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies. We employ the complex-valued order parameter --~a widely-used indicator for phase ordering~-- to assess the synchronization dynamics and observe the order parameter to exhibit either constant or periodic or non-periodic, possibly chaotic temporal evolutions for a given coupling strength but depending on initial conditions and the systems' disorder. Interestingly, both topological and spectral characteristics of the power grids point to a diminished capability of these networks to support a temporarily stable synchronization dynamics. We find non-trivial commonalities between the synchronization dynamics of oscillators on seemingly opposing topologies.</description>

      <title>Optimization hardness constrains ecological transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. Here, we frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in a complex foodweb lead to harder ill-conditioned problems, manifesting as slow modes on a nearly-degenerate solution landscape. Common dimensionality reduction methods precondition ecological dynamics, by isolating fast relaxation from slow solving timescales that exhibit transient chaos for harder problem instances. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using complexity bounds for constrained optimization. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Constants of Motion for Conserved and Non-conserved Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper begins with a dynamical model that was obtained by applying a machine learning technique (FJet) to time-series data; this dynamical model is then analyzed with Lie symmetry techniques to obtain constants of motion. This analysis is performed on both the conserved and non-conserved cases of the 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators. For the 1D oscillator, constants are found in the cases where the system is underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. The novel existence of such a constant for a non-conserved model is interpreted as a manifestation of the conservation of energy of the {\em total} system (i.e., oscillator plus dissipative environment). For the 2D oscillator, constants are found for the isotropic and anisotropic cases, including when the frequencies are incommensurate; it is also generalized to arbitrary dimensions. In addition, a constant is identified which generalizes angular momentum for all ratios of the frequencies. The approach presented here can produce {\em multiple} constants of motion from a {\em single}, generic data set.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 1. Wavenumber interaction and Eckhaus instability in a narrow domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection in a vertical channel subjected to a horizontal temperature gradient is numerically investigated. Previous numerical simulations reveal a variety of behaviors: steady, time-periodic and chaotic. We extend previous numerical investigations by constructing stable and unstable branches of equilibria and periodic orbits of the underlying Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations by parametric continuation. In a narrow domain of vertical aspect ratio ten, the observed flow structures are dominated by the competition between three and four co-rotating rolls. We identify the invariant solution branches underlying the observed flow dynamics, characterize the bifurcations creating those branches and link the observed bifurcation scenarios to the symmetries of the primary branches. Specifically, we show that D4 symmetry dictates that several intermediate branches bifurcate simultaneously from the four-roll branch, while D3 symmetry requires that the intersection of these intermediate branches with the three-roll branch be transcritical. We observe other manifestations of the competition between three and four rolls, in which the symmetry in time or in the transverse direction is broken, leading to limit cycles or wavy rolls, respectively. Our work highlights the interest of combining numerical simulations, bifurcation theory, and group theory, in order to understand the transitions between and origin of flow patterns.</description>
