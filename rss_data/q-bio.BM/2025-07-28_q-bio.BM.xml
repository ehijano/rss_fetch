      <title>PKAG-DDI: Pairwise Knowledge-Augmented Language Model for Drug-Drug Interaction Event Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) arise when multiple drugs are administered concurrently. Accurately predicting the specific mechanisms underlying DDIs (named DDI events or DDIEs) is critical for the safe clinical use of drugs. DDIEs are typically represented as textual descriptions. However, most computational methods focus more on predicting the DDIE class label over generating human-readable natural language increasing clinicians' interpretation costs. Furthermore, current methods overlook the fact that each drug assumes distinct biological functions in a DDI, which, when used as input context, can enhance the understanding of the DDIE process and benefit DDIE generation by the language model (LM). In this work, we propose a novel pairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text generation. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting structural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to select pairwise biological functions from the knowledge set, and a pairwise knowledge integration strategy that matches and integrates the selected biological functions into the LM. Experiments on two professional datasets show that PKAG-DDI outperforms existing methods in DDIE text generation, especially in challenging inductive scenarios, indicating its practicality and generalization.</description>

      <title>Latent-X: An Atom-level Frontier Model for De Novo Protein Binder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional drug discovery relies on rounds of screening millions of candidate molecules with low success rates, making drug discovery time and resource intensive. To overcome this screening bottleneck, we introduce Latent-X, an all-atom protein design model that enables a new paradigm of precision AI design. Given a target protein epitope, Latent-X jointly generates the all atom structure and sequence of the protein binder and target, directly modelling the non-covalent interactions essential for specific binding. We demonstrate its efficacy across two therapeutically relevant modalities through extensive wet lab experiments, testing as few as 30-100 designs per target. For macrocyclic peptides, Latent-X achieves experimental hit rates exceeding 90% on all evaluated benchmark targets. For mini-binders, it consistently produces potent candidates against all evaluated benchmark targets, with binding affinities reaching the low nanomolar and picomolar range - comparable to those of approved therapeutics - whilst also being highly specific in mammalian display. In direct comparisons with the state-of-the-art models AlphaProteo, RFdiffusion and RFpeptides under identical conditions demonstrates, Latent-X generates binders with higher hit rates and better binding affinities, and uniquely creates structurally diverse binders, including complex beta-sheet folds. Its end-to-end process is an order of magnitude faster than existing multi-step computational pipelines. By drastically improving the efficiency and success rate of de novo design, Latent-X represents a significant advance towards push-button biologics discovery and a valuable tool for protein engineers. Latent-X is available at https://platform.latentlabs.com, enabling users to reliably generate de novo binders without AI infrastructure or coding.</description>

      <title>Advancing biomolecular understanding and design following human instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and designing biomolecules, such as proteins and small molecules, is central to advancing drug discovery, synthetic biology and enzyme engineering. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence have revolutionized biomolecular research, achieving remarkable accuracy in biomolecular prediction and design. However, a critical gap remains between artificial intelligence's computational capabilities and researchers' intuitive goals, particularly in using natural language to bridge complex tasks with human intentions. Large language models have shown potential to interpret human intentions, yet their application to biomolecular research remains nascent due to challenges including specialized knowledge requirements, multimodal data integration, and semantic alignment between natural language and biomolecules. To address these limitations, we present InstructBioMol, a large language model designed to bridge natural language and biomolecules through a comprehensive any-to-any alignment of natural language, molecules and proteins. This model can integrate multimodal biomolecules as the input, and enable researchers to articulate design goals in natural language, providing biomolecular outputs that meet precise biological needs. Experimental results demonstrate that InstructBioMol can understand and design biomolecules following human instructions. In particular, it can generate drug molecules with a 10% improvement in binding affinity and design enzymes that achieve an enzyme-substrate pair prediction score of 70.4. This highlights its potential to transform real-world biomolecular research. The code is available at https://github.com/HICAI-ZJU/InstructBioMol.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum and Classical Computing in Drug Design: Architecture Principles for Improved Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning offers a path to leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for drug discovery, but optimal model architectures remain unclear. We systematically optimize the quantum-classical bridge architecture of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for molecule discovery using multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Our optimized model (BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher than the classical baseline, while reducing parameter count by more than 60%. Key findings favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a minimum capacity. This work provides the first empirically-grounded architectural guidelines for hybrid models, enabling more effective integration of current quantum computers into pharmaceutical research pipelines.</description>
