      <title>Fair Volatility: A Framework for Reconceptualizing Financial Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatility is the canonical measure of financial risk, a role largely inherited from Modern Portfolio Theory. Yet, its universality rests on restrictive efficiency assumptions that render volatility, at best, an incomplete proxy for true risk. This paper identifies three fundamental inconsistencies: (i) volatility is path-independent and blind to temporal dependence and non-stationarity; (ii) its relevance collapses in derivative-intensive strategies, where volatility often represents opportunity rather than risk; and (iii) it lacks an absolute benchmark, providing no guidance on what level of volatility is economically ``fair'' in efficient markets. To address these limitations, we propose a new paradigm that reconceptualizes risk in terms of predictability rather than variability. Building on a general class of stochastic processes, we derive an analytical link between volatility and the Hurst-Holder exponent within the Multifractional Process with Random Exponent (MPRE) framework. This relationship yields a formal definition of ``fair volatility'', namely the volatility implied under market efficiency, where prices follow semi-martingale dynamics. Extensive empirical analysis on global equity indices supports this framework, showing that deviations from fair volatility provide a tractable measure of market inefficiency, distinguishing between momentum-driven and mean-reverting regimes. Our results advance both the theoretical foundations and empirical assessment of financial risk, offering a definition of volatility that is efficiency-consistent and economically interpretable.</description>

      <title>Sharp Large Deviations and Gibbs Conditioning for Threshold Models in Portfolio Credit Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain sharp large deviation estimates for exceedance probabilities in dependent triangular array threshold models with a diverging number of latent factors. The prefactors quantify how latent-factor dependence and tail geometry enter at leading order, yielding three regimes: Gaussian or exponential-power tails produce polylogarithmic refinements of the Bahadur-Rao $n^{-1/2}$ law; regularly varying tails yield index-driven polynomial scaling; and bounded-support (endpoint) cases lead to an $n^{-3/2}$ prefactor. We derive these results through Laplace-Olver asymptotics for exponential integrals and conditional Bahadur-Rao estimates for the triangular arrays. Using these estimates, we establish a Gibbs conditioning principle in total variation: conditioned on a large exceedance event, the default indicators become asymptotically i.i.d., and the loss-given-default distribution is exponentially tilted (with the boundary case handled by an endpoint analysis). As illustrations, we obtain second-order approximations for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, clarifying when portfolios operate in the genuine large-deviation regime. The results provide a transferable set of techniques-localization, curvature, and tilt identification-for sharp rare-event analysis in dependent threshold systems.</description>
