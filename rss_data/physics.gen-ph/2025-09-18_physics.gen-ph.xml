      <title>Accelerating Mirrors as a Physical Realization of the Kappa Plane-Wave Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kappa plane-wave vacuum is a family of kinematically defined quantum states whose thermal properties are well-understood, but whose physical origin has remained an open question. In this paper, we provide a concrete dynamical realization for this vacuum, demonstrating that it is physically and operationally equivalent to the quantum state produced by an accelerating Carlitz-Willey (CW) mirror on future null infinity. The equivalence is established through a three-pronged proof, showing that both systems exhibit identical Bogoliubov squeeze parameters, identical non-local thermal kernels in their Wightman functions, and identical Planckian responses in an Unruh-DeWitt detector. This result grounds an abstract kinematic construction in a well-understood dynamical model, identifying the parameter $\kappa$ with the mirror's physical acceleration. We further generalize our findings by deriving the complete class of mirror trajectories that reproduce the same asymptotic thermal state and show that only the pure exponential CW trajectory generates a constant, stationary flux.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Explanation of the Meissner-Ochsenfeld Effect in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamic principle of superfluid flow -- that the energy is minimized at constant entropy -- is applied to superconducting currents to derive the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in which magnetic fields are expelled from superconductors. The principle gives a modified form for the first London equation that does not trap magnetic fields within a superconductor. The physical mechanism by which a critical magnetic field destroys superconductivity is identified.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Emission from an Accelerated Detector with Gaussian Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a closed-form analysis of second-order two-photon emission from a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector with a smooth Gaussian switch and derivative coupling. The time-ordered Dyson integrals are evaluated exactly, yielding a single spectral amplitude that simultaneously covers all four channels--right-travelling/right-travelling (RR), left-travelling/left-travelling (LL), right-travelling/left-travelling (RL), and left-travelling/right-travelling (LR). The spectra are organized by narrow kinematic gates (sum-frequency for RR/LL, difference-frequency for RL/LR) and a causal resonant denominator encoded by the Faddeeva function. As the gate time increases, the Gaussian factors sharpen into delta constraints and recover the eternal-interaction response. We map scaling with acceleration, gap, and duration, and show that the single-particle marginal combines a sharp nonthermal resonance with an Unruh thermal tail.</description>

      <title>Post-Carrollian Mechanics, Ideal Gas, and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy and momentum in Newtonian mechanics have the familiar relations, ($\mathrm{E}=mv^2/2$) and ($\mathbf{P}=m\mathbf{v}$), derived from the non-relativistic limit of special relativity. In this study, we find the corresponding relations to formulate the so-called ``post-Carrollian mechanics'' by applying the ultra-relativistic limit to tachyon theory, resulting in ($\mathrm{E}={m\,c^{\,3}}/{v}$) and ($\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{\hat{v}}\,{m\,c^{\,3}}/{2\,v^{\,2}}$). Using these, we determine the energy-momentum relation and investigate the thermodynamics of an ideal gas composed of post-Carroll particles. Moreover, by applying the ultra-relativistic limit to Einstein's equations coupled to tachyon dust, we find the post-Carrollian gravitational potential. Finally, utilizing the geodesic equation, we determine the post-Carrollian gravitational field, which unlike the Newtonian case is found to be radially outward.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Prediction of Material Properties from Topological Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for predicting material properties often rely on empirical models or approximations that overlook the fundamental topological nature of quantum interactions. We introduce a topological framework based on string theory and graph geometry that resolves ultraviolet divergences as topological obstructions regularized via Calabi-Yau mappings while preserving symmetries and causal structures, where molecular and condensed matter systems are represented combinatorially through a graph where M-branes form vertices and open strings are twistor-valued edges, holomorphically encoding geometric data from the dynamical system. The resulting effective action is governed by a graph Laplacian whose spectrum dictates stability, excitations, and phase transitions. Applied to uniaxial nematic liquid crystals, the model not only recovers the phenomenological virtual volumes of the Jiron-Castellon model from first principles but also predicts anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients and refractive indices with precision exceeding 0.06\%. The quantitative agreement with experiment, achieved without fitted parameters, demonstrates that principles from quantum gravity and string theory can directly yield accurate predictions for complex materials.</description>
