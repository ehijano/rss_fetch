      <title>AI Models Still Lag Behind Traditional Numerical Models in Predicting Sudden-Turning Typhoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the interpretability, accuracy, and stability of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, current operational weather forecasting relies heavily on the NWP approach. In the past two years, the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has provided an alternative solution for medium-range (1-10 days) weather forecasting. Bi et al. (2023) (hereafter Bi23) introduced the first AI-based weather prediction (AIWP) model in China, named Pangu-Weather, which offers fast prediction without compromising accuracy. In their work, Bi23 made notable claims regarding its effectiveness in extreme weather predictions. However, this claim lacks persuasiveness because the extreme nature of the two tropical cyclones (TCs) examples presented in Bi23, namely Typhoon Kong-rey and Typhoon Yutu, stems primarily from their intensities rather than their moving paths. Their claim may mislead into another meaning which is that Pangu-Weather works well in predicting unusual typhoon paths, which was not explicitly analyzed. Here, we reassess Pangu-Weather's ability to predict extreme TC trajectories from 2020-2024. Results reveal that while Pangu-Weather overall outperforms NWP models in predicting tropical cyclone (TC) tracks, it falls short in accurately predicting the rarely observed sudden-turning tracks, such as Typhoon Khanun in 2023. We argue that current AIWP models still lag behind traditional NWP models in predicting such rare extreme events in medium-range forecasts.</description>

      <title>West Antarctic Meltwater can Prevent an AMOC Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and polar ice sheets are coupled tipping elements, allowing for potential cascading tipping events in which tipping is facilitated by their mutual interactions. However, while an AMOC destabilization driven by Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) meltwater release is well documented, the consequences of a West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) tipping on the AMOC remain unclear. In the Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity CLIMBER-X, we perform experiments where meltwater fluxes representing plausible tipping trajectories of the GIS and WAIS are applied. We find that WAIS meltwater input can increase the AMOC resilience to GIS meltwater. In particular, we show that this stabilizing effect can cause the AMOC recovery and, for the first time in a comprehensive model, totally prevent an AMOC collapse. Moreover, we find this stabilzation to occur for ice sheet tipping trajectories that are relevant under high future greenhouse gas emission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Observed circulation trends in boreal summer linked to two spatially distinct teleconnection patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various regions in the Northern Hemispheric midlatitudes have seen pronounced trends in upper-atmosphere summer circulation and surface temperature extremes over recent decades. Several of these regional trends lie outside the range of historic CMIP6 model simulations, and they might constitute a joined dynamic response that is missed by climate models. Here, we examine if the regional trends in circulation are indeed part of a coherent circumglobal wave pattern. Using ERA5 reanalysis data and CMIP6 historical simulations, we find that the observed upper-atmospheric circulation trends consist of at least two separate regional signatures: a US-Atlantic and a Eurasian trend pattern. The circulation trend in these two regions can explain up to 30% of the observed regional temperature trends. The circulation trend in the CMIP6 multi-model-mean does not resemble the observed trend pattern and is much weaker overall. Some individual CMIP6 models do show a resemblance to the observed pattern in ERA5, although still weak with a maximum pattern correlation of 0.47. The pattern correlation is higher for the two individual regions, reaching a maximum of 0.78. We show that both regional wave patterns in ERA5 are associated with distinct sea surface temperature and outgoing longwave radiation anomalies in the three weeks leading up to the atmospheric configuration, resembling known teleconnection patterns. CMIP6 models appear to lack these tropical-extra-tropical teleconnections. Our findings highlight the limitations of CMIP6 models in reproducing teleconnections and their associated regional imprint, creating deep uncertainty for regional climate projections on decadal to multi-decadal timescales.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization of Water Resource Allocation for Groundwater Recharge and Surface Runoff Management in Watershed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Land degradation and air pollution are primarily caused by the salinization of soil and desertification that occurs from the drying of salinity lakes and the release of dust into the atmosphere because of their dried bottom. The complete drying up of a lake has caused a community environmental catastrophe. In this study, we presented an optimization problem to determine the total surface runoff to maintain the level of salinity lake (Urmia Lake). The proposed process has two key stages: identifying the influential factors in determining the lake water level using sensitivity analysis approaches based upon historical data and optimizing the effective variable to stabilize the lake water level under changing design variables. Based upon the Sobol'-Jansen and Morris techniques, the groundwater level and total surface runoff flow are highly effective with nonlinear and interacting impacts of the lake water level. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, we found that it may be possible to effectively manage lake levels by adjusting total surface runoff. We used genetic algorithms, non-linear optimization, and pattern search techniques to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the lake level constraint is established based on a pattern as a constant number every month. In order to maintain a consistent pattern of lake levels, it is necessary to increase surface runoff by approximately 8.7 times during filling season. It is necessary to increase this quantity by 33.5 times during the draining season. In the future, the results may serve as a guide for the rehabilitation of the lake.</description>

      <title>Integrating Weather Station Data and Radar for Precipitation Nowcasting: SmaAt-fUsion and SmaAt-Krige-GNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, data-driven, deep learning-based approaches for precipitation nowcasting have attracted significant attention, showing promising results. However, many existing models fail to fully exploit the extensive atmospheric information available, relying primarily on precipitation data alone. This study introduces two novel deep learning architectures, SmaAt-fUsion and SmaAt-Krige-GNet, specifically designed to enhance precipitation nowcasting by integrating multi-variable weather station data with radar datasets. By leveraging additional meteorological information, these models improve representation learning in the latent space, resulting in enhanced nowcasting performance. The SmaAt-fUsion model extends the SmaAt-UNet framework by incorporating weather station data through a convolutional layer, integrating it into the bottleneck of the network. Conversely, the SmaAt-Krige-GNet model combines precipitation maps with weather station data processed using Kriging, a geo-statistical interpolation method, to generate variable-specific maps. These maps are then utilized in a dual-encoder architecture based on SmaAt-GNet, allowing multi-level data integration. Experimental evaluations were conducted using four years (2016--2019) of weather station and precipitation radar data from the Netherlands. Results demonstrate that SmaAt-Krige-GNet outperforms the standard SmaAt-UNet, which relies solely on precipitation radar data, in low precipitation scenarios, while SmaAt-fUsion surpasses SmaAt-UNet in both low and high precipitation scenarios. This highlights the potential of incorporating discrete weather station data to enhance the performance of deep learning-based weather nowcasting models.</description>

      <title>Update hydrological states or meteorological forcings? Comparing data assimilation methods for differentiable hydrologic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) enables hydrologic models to update their internal states using near-real-time observations for more accurate forecasts. With deep neural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM), using either lagged observations as inputs (called "data integration") or variational DA has shown success in improving forecasts. However, it is unclear which methods are performant or optimal for physics-informed machine learning ("differentiable") models, which represent only a small amount of physically-meaningful states while using deep networks to supply parameters or missing processes. Here we developed variational DA methods for differentiable models, including optimizing adjusters for just precipitation data, just model internal hydrological states, or both. Our results demonstrated that differentiable streamflow models using the CAMELS dataset can benefit strongly and equivalently from variational DA as LSTM, with one-day lead time median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) elevated from 0.75 to 0.82. The resulting forecast matched or outperformed LSTM with DA in the eastern, northwestern, and central Great Plains regions of the conterminous United States. Both precipitation and state adjusters were needed to achieve these results, with the latter being substantially more effective on its own, and the former adding moderate benefits for high flows. Our DA framework does not need systematic training data and could serve as a practical DA scheme for whole river networks.</description>
