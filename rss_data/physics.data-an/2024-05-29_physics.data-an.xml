      <title>Untangling Climate's Complexity: Methodological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we review the interdisciplinary techniques (borrowed from physics, mathematics, statistics, machine-learning, etc.) and methodological framework that we have used to understand climate systems, which serve as examples of "complex systems". We believe that this would offer valuable insights to comprehend the complexity of climate variability and pave the way for drafting policies for action against climate change, etc. Our basic aim is to analyse time-series data structures across diverse climate parameters, extract Fourier-transformed features to recognize and model the trends/seasonalities in the climate variables using standard methods like detrended residual series analyses, correlation structures among climate parameters, Granger causal models, and other statistical machine-learning techniques. We cite and briefly explain two case studies: (i) the relationship between the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and specific climate variables including Sea Surface Temperature (SST), El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), uncovering temporal shifts in correlations between SPI and these variables, and reveal complex patterns that drive drought and wet climate conditions in South-West Australia; (ii) the complex interactions of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, with SST and sea ice extent (SIE), potentially arising from positive feedback loops.</description>

      <title>Universal deterministic patterns in stochastic count data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of deterministic patterns in plots showing the relationship between the mean and the Fano factor (ratio of variance and mean) of stochastic count data. These patterns are found in a wide variety of datasets, including those from genomics, paper citations, commerce, ecology, disease outbreaks, and employment statistics. We develop a theory showing that the patterns naturally emerge when data sampled from discrete probability distributions is organised in matrix form. The theory precisely predicts the patterns and shows that they are a function of only one variable - the sample size.</description>

      <title>Is machine learning good or bad for the natural sciences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods are having a huge impact across all of the sciences. However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist - and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here, we identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology and epistemology are valuable. For example, when an expressive machine learning model is used in a causal inference to represent the effects of confounders, such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument calibration parameters, the model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the results more trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction of ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they introduce strong confirmation biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used to label datasets, those labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble analyses without taking on uncontrolled biases. The question in the title is being asked of all of the natural sciences; that is, we are calling on the scientific communities to take a step back and consider the role and value of ML in their fields; the (partial) answers we give here come from the particular perspective of physics.</description>
