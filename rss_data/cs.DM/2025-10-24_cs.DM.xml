      <title>Labeling and folding multi-labeled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1989 Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely showed that there is a bijection between (i) the set of rooted trees with $n+1$ vertices whose leaves are bijectively labeled with the elements of $[\ell]=\{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ for some $\ell \leq n$, and (ii) the set of partitions of $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. They established this via a labeling algorithm based on the anti-lexicographic ordering of non-empty subsets of $[n]$ which extends the labeling of the leaves of a given tree to a labeling of all of the vertices of that tree. In this paper, we generalize their approach by developing a labeling algorithm for multi-labeled trees, that is, rooted trees whose leaves are labeled by positive integers but in which distinct leaves may have the same label. In particular, we show that certain orderings of the set of all finite, non-empty multisets of positive integers can be used to characterize partitions of a multiset that arise from labelings of multi-labeled trees. As an application, we show that the recently introduced class of labelable phylogenetic networks is precisely the class of phylogenetic networks that are stable relative to the so-called folding process on multi-labeled trees. We also give a bijection between the labelable phylogenetic networks with leaf-set $[n]$ and certain partitions of multisets.</description>

      <title>Excluding a Line Minor via Design Matrices and Column Number Bounds for the Circuit Imbalance Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a real matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ with non-collinear columns, we show that $n \leq O(d^4 \kappa_A)$ where $\kappa_A$ is the \emph{circuit imbalance measure} of $A$. The circuit imbalance measure $\kappa$ is a real analogue of $\Delta$-modularity for integer matrices, satisfying $\kappa_A \leq \Delta_A$ for integer $A$. The circuit imbalance measure has numerous applications in the context of linear programming (see Ekbatani, Natura and V{\'e}gh (2022) for a survey). Our result generalizes the $O(d^4 \Delta_A)$ bound of Averkov and Schymura (2023) for integer matrices and provides the first polynomial bound holding for all parameter ranges on real matrices.
  To derive our result, similar to the strategy of Geelen, Nelson and Walsh (2021) for $\Delta$-modular matrices, we show that real representable matroids induced by $\kappa$-bounded matrices are minor closed and exclude a rank $2$ uniform matroid on $O(\kappa)$ elements as a minor (also known as a line of length $O(\kappa)$).
  As our main technical contribution, we show that any simple rank $d$ complex representable matroid which excludes a line of length $l$ has at most $O(d^4 l)$ elements. This complements the tight bound of $(l-3)\binom{d}{2} + d$ for $l \geq 4$, of Geelen, Nelson and Walsh which holds when the rank $d$ is sufficiently large compared to $l$ (at least doubly exponential in $l$).</description>

      <title>Partial Optimality in Cubic Correlation Clustering for General Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher-order correlation clustering problem for a graph $G$ and costs associated with cliques of $G$ consists in finding a clustering of $G$ so as to minimize the sum of the costs of those cliques whose nodes all belong to the same cluster. To tackle this NP-hard problem in practice, local search heuristics have been proposed and studied in the context of applications. Here, we establish partial optimality conditions for cubic correlation clustering, i.e., for the special case of at most 3-cliques. We define and implement algorithms for deciding these conditions and examine their effectiveness numerically, on two data sets.</description>

      <title>A Classification of Long-Refinement Graphs for Colour Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Colour Refinement algorithm is a classical procedure to detect symmetries in graphs, whose most prominent application is in graph-isomorphism tests. The algorithm and its generalisation, the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, evaluate local information to compute a colouring for the vertices in an iterative fashion. Different final colours of two vertices certify that no isomorphism can map one onto the other. The number of iterations that the algorithm takes to terminate is its central complexity parameter. For a long time, it was open whether graphs that take the maximum theoretically possible number of Colour Refinement iterations actually exist. Starting from an exhaustive search on graphs of low degrees, Kiefer and McKay proved the existence of infinite families of such long-refinement graphs with degrees 2 and 3, thereby showing that the trivial upper bound on the iteration number of Colour Refinement is tight. In this work, we provide a complete characterisation of the long-refinement graphs with low (or, equivalently, high) degrees. We show that, with one exception, the aforementioned families are the only long-refinement graphs with maximum degree at most 3, and we fully classify the long-refinement graphs with maximum degree 4. To this end, via a reverse-engineering approach, we show that all low-degree long-refinement graphs can be represented as compact strings, and we derive multiple structural insights from this surprising fact. Since long-refinement graphs are closed under taking edge complements, this also yields a classification of long-refinement graphs with high degrees. Kiefer and McKay initiated a search for long-refinement graphs that are only distinguished in the last iteration of Colour Refinement before termination. We conclude it in this submission by showing that such graphs cannot exist.</description>

      <title>Boundary vertices of Strongly Connected Digraphs with respect to `Sum Metric'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $D = (V, E)$ is a strongly connected digraph and $u, v \in V (D)$. Among the many metrics in graphs, the sum metric warrants further exploration. The sum distance $sd(u, v)$ defined as $sd(u, v) =\overrightarrow{d}(u, v)+\overrightarrow{d}(v, u)$ is a metric where $\overrightarrow{d}(u, v)$ denotes the length of the shortest directed $u - v$ path in $D$. The four main boundary vertices in the digraphs are ``boundary vertices, contour vertices, eccentric vertices'', and ``peripheral vertices'' and their relationships have been studied. Also, an attempt is made to study the boundary-type sets of corona product of (di)graphs. The center of the corona product of two strongly connected digraphs is established. All the boundary-type sets and the center of the corona product are established in terms of factor digraphs.</description>

      <title>Solving decision problems by distributed consensus with one-dimensional, binary, radius-$2$ cellular automata over cyclic configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the ability of automata networks to solve decision problems has received a continuous attention in the literature, and specially with the automata reaching the answer by distributed consensus, i.e., their all taking on a same state, out of two. In the case of binary automata networks, regardless of the kind of update employed, the networks should display only two possible attractors, the fixed points $0^L$ and $1^L$, for all cyclic configurations of size $L$. A previous investigation into the space of one-dimensional, binary, radius-2 cellular automata identified a restricted subset of rules as potential solvers of decision problems, but the reported results were incomplete and lacked sufficient detail for replication. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive reevaluation of the entire radius-2 rule space, by filtering it with all configuration sizes from 5 to 20, according to their basins of attraction being formed by only the two expected fixed points. A set of over fifty-four thousand potential decision problem solvers were then obtained. Among these, more than forty-five thousand were associated with 3 well-defined decision problems, and precise formal explanations were provided for over forty thousand of them. The remaining candidate rules suggest additional problem classes yet to be fully characterised. Overall, this work substantially extends the understanding of radius-2 cellular automata, offering a more complete picture of their capacity to solve decision problems by consensus.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for $h$-extra edge-connectivity reliability analysis of enhanced hypercubes $Q_{n,2}$ with exponentially many faulty links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The $(n, k)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,k}$, as a variation of the hypercube $Q_{n}$, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, $h$-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph $G,$ $\lambda_h(G),$ is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the $h$-extra edge-connectivity of the $(n,2)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,2}$. Suppose that the link malfunction of an interconnection network $Q_{n,2}$ does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than $h-1$ processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrates on a constant $2^{n-1}$ for each integer $\lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1}$ and $n\geq 9$. That is, for about $77.083\%$ of values where $h\leq2^{n-1},$ the corresponding $h$-extra edge-connectivity of $Q_{n,2}$, $\lambda_h(Q_{n,2})$, presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the lower and upper bounds of $h$ mentioned above are both tight.</description>

      <title>Depth-Bounds for Neural Networks via the Braid Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\Omega(\log\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, under our assumption, we provide a combinatorial proof that 3 hidden layers are necessary to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers.</description>

      <title>Catching Rats in $H$-minor-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every $H$-minor-free graph that also excludes a $(k \times k)$-grid as a minor has treewidth/branchwidth bounded from above by a function $f(t,k)$ that is linear in $k$ and polynomial in $t := |V(H)|$. Such a result was proven originally by [Demaine &amp; Hajiaghayi, Combinatorica, 2008], where $f$ was indeed linear in $k$. However the dependency in $t$ in this result was non-explicit (and huge). Later, [Kawarabayashi &amp; Kobayashi, JCTB, 2020] showed that this bound can be estimated to be $f(t,k)\in 2^{\mathcal{O}(t\log t)} \cdot k$. Wood recently asked whether $f$ can be pushed further to be polynomial, while maintaining the linearity on $k$. We answer this in a particularly strong sense, by showing that the treewidth/branchwidth of $G$ is in $\mathcal{O}(gk + t^{2304}),$ where $g$ is the Euler genus of $H$. This directly yields $f(t,k)= \mathcal{O}(t^2k + t^{2304})$.
  Our methods build on techniques for branchwidth and on new bounds and insights for the Graph Minor Structure Theorem (GMST) due to [Gorsky, Seweryn &amp; Wiederrecht, 2025, arXiv:2504.02532]. In particular, we prove a variant of the GMST that ensures some helpful properties for the minor relation. We further employ our methods to provide approximation algorithms for the treewidth/branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and every $t$-vertex graph $H$ with Euler genus $g$, we give a $(g + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the branchwidth of $H$-minor-free graphs running in $2^{\mathsf{poly}(t) / \varepsilon} \cdot \mathsf{poly}(n)$-time. Our algorithms explicitly return either an appropriate branch-decomposition or a grid-minor certifying a negative answer.</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes in the Lee Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes are a coding framework designed to minimize redundancy while ensuring that specific functions or computations of encoded data can be reliably recovered, even in the presence of errors. The choice of metric is crucial in designing such codes, as it determines which computations must be protected and how errors are measured and corrected. Previous work by Liu and Liu [6] studied function-correcting codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l},\ l\geq 2$ using the homogeneous metric, which coincides with the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. In this paper, we extend the study to codes over $\mathbb{Z}_m,$ for any positive integer $m\geq 2$ under the Lee metric and aim to determine their optimal redundancy. To achieve this, we introduce irregular Lee distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy by characterizing the shortest possible length of such codes. These general bounds are then simplified and applied to specific classes of functions, including Lee-local functions, Lee weight functions, and Lee weight distribution functions. We extend the bounds established by Liu and Liu [6] for codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ in the Lee metric to the more general setting of $\mathbb{Z}_m$.
  Additionally, we explicitly derive a Plotkin-like bound for linear function-correcting codes in the Lee metric. As the Lee metric coincides with the Hamming metric over the binary field, we demonstrate that our bound naturally reduces to a Plotkin-type bound for function-correcting codes under the Hamming metric over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.
  Furthermore, when the underlying function is bijective, function-correcting codes reduce to classical error-correcting codes. In parallel, our bound correspondingly reduces to the classical Plotkin bound for error-correcting codes, both for the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_m$ and for the Hamming metric over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Computing the VC-Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The VC-dimension is a well-studied and fundamental complexity measure of a set system (or hypergraph) that is central to many areas of machine learning. We establish several new results on the complexity of computing the VC-dimension. In particular, given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, we prove that the naive $2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|)}$-time algorithm is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We then prove that the problem admits a $1$-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We design a $2^{\mathcal{O}(\rm{tw}\cdot \log \rm{tw})}\cdot |V|$-time algorithm for any graph $G=(V,E)$ of treewidth $\rm{tw}$ (which, for a set system, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). This is in contrast with closely related problems that require a double-exponential dependency on the treewidth (assuming the ETH).</description>

      <title>Recommend-to-Match with Random Supply Rejections: Formulation, Approximation, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching demand with supply in crowd-sourcing logistics platforms must contend with uncertain worker participation. Motivated by this challenge, we study a two-stage ``recommend-to-match" problem under stochastic supplier rejections, where each demand is initially recommended to multiple potential suppliers prior to final matching decisions. We formulate a stochastic optimization model that explicitly captures uncertain supplier acceptance behavior. We show that an exact mixed-integer linear formulation is obtainable for the special case with homogeneous and independent acceptance responses, but the general problem does not admit an efficient formulation. Particularly, our analysis reveals that deterministic linear approximation methods can perform arbitrarily poorly in such settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approximation approach based on mixed-integer exponential cone programming (MIECP) and establish its parametric performance guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world freight data validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our MIECP-based solution achieves near-optimal matching performance while reducing computation time by over 90% compared to benchmark methods.</description>
