      <title>Energy decay for semilinear evolution equations with memory and time-dependent time delay feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study well-posedness and exponential stability for semilinear second order evolution equations with memory and time-varying delay feedback. The time delay function is assumed to be continuous and bounded. Under a suitable assumption on the delay feedback, we are able to prove that solutions corresponding to small initial data are globally defined and satisfy an exponential decay estimate.</description>

      <title>A two-phase problem with degenerate operator in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the study of a two-phase problem equipped with the $\Phi$-Laplacian operator
  $$ \Delta_\Phi u \coloneqq \mbox{div} \left(\phi(|\nabla u|)\dfrac{\nabla u}{|\nabla u|}\right),
  $$
  where
  $\Phi(s)=e^{s^2}-1$ and $\phi=\Phi'$. We obtain the existence, boundedness, and Log-Lipschitz regularity of the minimizers of the energy functional associated to the two-phase problem. Furthermore, we also prove that the phase change free boundaries of the minimizers possess a finite perimeter.</description>

      <title>Liouville type theorems for the 3D stationary MHD and Hall-MHD equations with non-zero constant vectors at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Liouville type theorems for the three-dimensional steady-state MHD or Hall-MHD system under some asymptotic assumptions at infinity. Firstly, for the Hall-MHD system we obtain that $u$ and $B$ are constant vectors for any fluid viscosity, magnetic resistivity or Hall-coefficient when the magnetic field $B$ tends to a non-zero constant vector at infinity while the velocity field $u$ tends to $0$. Secondly, it also follows that $u$ and $B$ are constant for the Hall-MHD system when the velocity field tends to a constant vector at infinity while the magnetic field tends to $0$ without any assumptions on viscosity, magnetic resistivity or Hall-coefficient. One main difficulty lies in the Hall term, and we obtain the $L^p$ estimates of a generalized Oseen system with some supercritical terms via Lizorkin's theory and prove that the operator is stable by exploring Kato's stability theorem. Moreover, some similar results for the degenerate fluid viscosity or magnetic resistivity for the MHD system are also obtained, which is independent of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we employ the relative energy method to obtain a weak-strong uniqueness principle for a Euler-Riesz system, as well as to establish its convergence in the high-friction limit towards a gradient flow equation. The main technical challenge in our analysis is addressed using a specific case of a Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality for Riesz potentials.</description>

      <title>Some three dimensional smooth transonic flows for the steady Euler equations with an external force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of some smooth accelerating transonic flows governed by the steady compressible Euler equations with an external force in cylinders with arbitrary cross sections, which include both irrotational flows and Beltrami flows with nonuniform proportionality factors. One of the key ingredients in the analysis of smooth transonic irrotational flows is the well-posedness theory for a linear elliptic-hyperbolic mixed second order differential equation of Keldysh type in cylinders, which is achieved by extending the problem to an auxiliary linear elliptic-hyberbolic-elliptic mixed problem in a longer cylinder where the governing equation becomes elliptic at the exit of the new cylinder, so that one can use the multiplier method and the cut-off techniques to derive the $H^2$ and higher order estimates in transonic regions. It is further shown that the energy estimate can be closed in the $H^4$ framework. For smooth transonic Beltrami flows, we solve a transport equation for the proportionality factor and a type-changing enlarged deformation-curl system with mixed boundary conditions. The compatibility conditions for the $H^4$ estimate to the enlarged deformation-curl system near the intersection between the entrance and the cylinder wall play a crucial role in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic well-posedeness for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the $2d$ sphere I: positive regularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the probabilistic well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the $2d$ sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. The initial data are distributed according to Gaussian measures with typical regularity $H^{s}(\mathbb{S}^{2})$, for $s&gt;0$. This level of regularity goes significantly beyond existing deterministic results, in a regime where the flow map cannot be extended uniformly continuously.</description>

      <title>The Second Picard iteration of NLS on the $2d$ sphere does not regularize Gaussian random initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Wick ordered cubic Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) posed on the two-dimensional sphere, with initial data distributed according to a Gaussian measure. We show that the second Picard iteration does not improve the regularity of the initial data in the scale of the classical Sobolev spaces. This is in sharp contrast with the Wick ordered NLS on the two-dimensional tori, a model for which we know from the work of Bourgain that the second Picard iteration gains one half derivative. Our proof relies on identifying a singular part of the nonlinearity. We show that this singular part is responsible for a concentration phenomenon on a large circle (i.e. a stable closed geodesic), which prevents any regularization in the second Picard iteration.</description>

      <title>Commutator estimates and Poisson bounds for Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator ${\cal N}$ associated with a general elliptic operator \[ {\cal A} u = - \sum_{k,l=1}^d \partial_k (c_{kl}\, \partial_l u) + \sum_{k=1}^d \Big( c_k\, \partial_k u - \partial_k (b_k\, u) \Big) +c_0\, u \in {\cal D}'(\Omega) \] with possibly complex coefficients. We study three problems:
  1) Boundedness on $C^\nu$ and on $L_p$ of the commutator $[{\cal N}, M_g]$, where $M_g$ denotes the multiplication operator by a smooth function $g$.
  2) H\"older and $L_p$-bounds for the harmonic lifting associated with ${\cal A}$.
  3) Poisson bounds for the heat kernel of ${\cal N}$.
  We solve these problems in the case where the coefficients are H\"older continuous and the underlying domain is bounded and of class $C^{1+\kappa}$ for some $\kappa &gt; 0$. For the Poisson bounds we assume in addition that the coefficients are real-valued. We also prove gradient estimates for the heat kernel and the Green function $G$ of the elliptic operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the damped wave semigroup on the tadpole graph ${\mathcal R}$. We first give a meticulous spectral analysis, followed by a judicious decomposition of the resolvent's kernel. As a consequence, and by showing that the generalized eigenfunctions form a Riesz basis of some subspace of the energy space $\mathcal{H}$, we establish the exponential decay of the corresponding energy, with the optimal decay rate dictated by the spectral abscissa of the relevant operator.</description>

      <title>$H^2$-regularity for stationary and non-stationary Bingham problems with perfect slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $H^2$-spatial regularity of stationary and non-stationary problems for Bingham fluids formulated with the pseudo-stress tensor is discussed. The problem is mathematically described by an elliptic or parabolic variational inequality of the second kind, to which weak solvability in the Sobolev space $H^1$ is well known. However, higher regularity up to the boundary in a bounded smooth domain seems to remain open. This paper indeed shows such $H^2$-regularity if the problems are supplemented with the so-called perfect slip boundary condition. For the stationary Bingham-Stokes problem, the key of the proof lies in a priori estimates for a regularized problem avoiding investigation of higher pressure regularity, which seems difficult to get in the presence of a singular diffusion term. The $H^2$-regularity for the stationary case is then directly applied to establish strong solvability of the non-stationary Bingham-Navier-Stokes problem, based on discretization in time and on the truncation of the nonlinear convection term.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a simple proof that any function in the Besov space $B^{m-a,1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ can be extended to a function in $W_{a}^{m+1,1}(\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1})$. In particular, utilizing the intrinsic seminorm in $B^{m-a,1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, we show that either a suitably scaled heat extension or the harmonic extension provides one with the desired lifting.</description>

Abstract: We study the diffusion limit of the strong solution to the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann (VMB) system with initial data near a global Maxwellian. By introducing a new decomposition of the solution to identify the essential components for generating the initial layer, we prove the convergence and establish the opitmal convergence rate of the classical solution to the VMB system to the solution of the Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system based on the spectral analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the following problem. \begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -{\Delta}u=\lambda I_\alpha*_\Omega u+|u|^{2^*-2}u\mbox{ in }\Omega ,\nonumber
u\in H_0^1(\Omega).\nonumber
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation} Here, $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\geq3$, $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$, $\lambda\in(0,N)$, $I_\alpha$ is the Riesz potential and \begin{align} I_\alpha*_\Omega u(x):=\int_\Omega \frac{\Gamma(\frac{N-\alpha}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{\alpha}{2})\pi^\frac{N}{2}2^\alpha|x-y|^{N-\alpha}} u(y)dy. \nonumber \end{align} We study the non-existence, existence and multiplicity results. Our argument combines Brezis-Nirenberg's method with the regularity results involving potential terms. Especially, we study the following nonlocal eigenvalue problem. \begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -{\Delta}u=\lambda I_\alpha*_\Omega u\mbox{ in }\Omega ,\nonumber
  \lambda\in\mathbb{R},\,u\in H_0^1(\Omega).\nonumber

      <title>Oscillations in Compressible Navier-Stokes and Homogenization in Phase Transition problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this article we present some exact solutions for special hyperbolic-parabolic systems with sustained oscillations induced by the initial data, most notably the compressible Navier-Stokes system with non-monotone pressure. This part complements \cite{Tzavaras23} where such examples are extensively studied. The second part deals with the problem of homogenization for one-dimensional models describing phase transitions for viscoelastic materials . Ideas from the kinetic formulation of conservation laws are employed to derive effective equations that describe the propagation of oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct examples of oscillating solutions with persistent oscillations for various hyperbolic-parabolic systems with singular diffusion matrices that appear in mechanics. These include, an example for the equations of nonlinear viscoelasticity of Kelvin-Voigt type with stored energy that violates rank-one convexity, which amounts to a time-dependent variant of twinning solutions. An example pertaining to the system of gas dynamics with thermal effects for a viscous, adiabatic gas. Finally, an example for the compressible Navier-Stokes system in one-space dimension with nonmonotone pressure function. We also study the existence of oscillating solutions for linear hyperbolic-parabolic systems with singular diffusion matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time asymptotic stability for one-dimensional relaxed compressible Navier-Stokes equations is studied. We show that the composite waves of viscous shock and rarefaction are asymptotically nonlinear stable with both small wave strength and small initial perturbations. Moreover, as the relaxation parameter goes to zero, the solutions of relaxed system are shown to converge globally in time to that of classical system. The methods are based on relative entropy, the a-contraction with shifts theory and basic energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Increasing resolution and instability for linear inverse scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the increasing resolution of linear inverse scattering problems at a large fixed frequency. We consider the problem of recovering the density of a Herglotz wave function, and the linearized inverse scattering problem for a potential. It is shown that the number of features that can be stably recovered (stable region) becomes larger as the frequency increases, whereas one has strong instability for the rest of the features (unstable region). To show this rigorously, we prove that the singular values of the forward operator stay roughly constant in the stable region and decay exponentially in the unstable region. The arguments are based on structural properties of the problems and they involve the Courant min-max principle for singular values, quantitative Agmon-H\"ormander estimates, and a Schwartz kernel computation based on the coarea formula.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence involving nonlocal gradients with varying horizon: Recovery of local and fractional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work revolves around the rigorous asymptotic analysis of models in nonlocal hyperelasticity. The corresponding variational problems involve integral functionals depending on nonlocal gradients with a finite interaction range $\delta$, called the horizon. After an isotropic scaling of the associated kernel functions, we prove convergence results in the two critical limit regimes of vanishing and diverging horizon. While the nonlocal gradients localize to the classical gradient as $\delta\to 0$, we recover the Riesz fractional gradient as $\delta\to \infty$, irrespective of the nonlocal gradient we started with. Besides rigorous convergence statements for the nonlocal gradients, our analysis in both cases requires compact embeddings uniformly in $\delta$ as a crucial ingredient. These tools enable us to derive the $\Gamma$-convergence of quasiconvex integral functionals with varying horizon to their local and fractional counterparts, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Gauss curvature flow approach to the p-harmonic measure of Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem of harmonic measures was first studied by Jerison \cite{JER1991}. Recently, Akman and Mukherjee \cite{AKM2023} studied the Minkowski problem corresponding to $p$-harmonic measures on convex domains and generalized Jerison's results. In this paper, we obtain the existence of the smooth solution of the $p$-harmonic measure Minkowski problem by method of the Gauss curvature flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we develop a mathematical model that describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and heat transfer in closed electrical contacts that arises when instantaneous explosion of the micro-asperity which involves vaporization zone and liquid, solid zones where temperature is defined by a generalized heat equation with Thomson effect. This model account for the nonlinear nature of the thermal coefficients and electrical conductivity depended on temperature. Our proposed solutions are based on similarity transformation which allows us to reduce a Stefan-type problem to a system of nonlinear integral equations whose existence of solution is proved by the fixed point theory in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Continuity of attractors of parabolic equations with nonlinear boundary conditions and rapidly varying boundaries. The case of a Lipschitz deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the continuity of attractors for nonlinear parabolic equations with nonlinear boundary conditions when the boundary of the domain varies very rapidly as a parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero. We want to consider the case which the boundary of the domain presents a highly oscillatory behavior as $\epsilon$ goes to zero. For the case where we have a Lipschitz deformation of the boundary with the Lipschitz constant uniformly bounded in $\epsilon$ but the boundaries do not approach in a Lipschitz sense, the solutions of these equations $E$-converge to the solution of a limit parabolic equation of the same type, where the boundary condition has a factor that captures the oscillations of the boundary. To address this problem, it is necessary to consider the notion of convergence of functions defined in varying domains and the convergence of a family of operators defined in different Banach spaces. Since the problems have nonlinear terms at the boundary, then it is necessary to extend these concepts to the case of spaces with negative exponents and to operators defined between these spaces.</description>

      <title>Stocking and Harvesting Effects in Advection-Reaction-Diffusion Model: Exploring Decoupled Algorithms and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a time-dependent Advection Reaction Diffusion (ARD) $N$-species competition model to investigate the Stocking and Harvesting (SH) effect on population dynamics. For ongoing analysis, we explore the outcomes of a competition between two competing species in a heterogeneous environment under no-flux boundary conditions, meaning no individual can cross the boundaries. We establish results concerning the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the solution. As a continuation, we propose, analyze, and test two novel fully discrete decoupled linearized algorithms for a nonlinearly coupled ARD $N$-species competition model with SH effort. The time-stepping algorithms are first and second order accurate in time and optimally accurate in space. Stability and optimal convergence theorems of the decoupled schemes are proved rigorously. We verify the predicted convergence rates of our analysis and the efficacy of the algorithms using numerical experiments and synthetic data for analytical test problems. We also study the effect of harvesting or stocking and diffusion parameters on the evolution of species population density numerically and observe the coexistence scenario subject to optimal stocking or harvesting.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity of the ballistic-conductive model of heat conduction: the reverse side of the coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heat equation, based on Fourier's law, is commonly used for description of heat conduction. However, Fourier's law is valid under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, which is violated in very small dimensions and short timescales, and at low temperatures. In the paper R. Kovacs and P. Van, Generalized heat conduction in heat pulse experiments, Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 83:613-620, 2015, a ballistic-conductive (BC) model of heat conduction was developed. In this paper, we study the behavior of solutions to an initial value problem (IVP) in 1D in the framework of the linearized ballistic-conductive (BC) model. As a result of the study, an unphysical effect has been found when part of the initial thermal energy does not spread anywhere.</description>

      <title>On instability of the Taylor-Green vortex in 2D Euler flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Euler flows on two-dimensional (2D) periodic domain and are interested in the stability, both linear and nonlinear, of a simple equilibrium given by the 2D Taylor-Green vortex. As the first main result, numerical evidence is provided for the fact that such flows possess unstable eigenvalues embedded in the band of the essential spectrum of the linearized operator, which suggests that passage from linear to non-linear instability in the energy metric is likely for such flows. The latter is confirmed numerically as well by demonstrating exponential transient growth of the nonlinear dynamics with the rate given by the real part of the unstable eigenvalue. However, the unstable eigenfunction is a distribution, rather than a smooth function, and is unbounded in the neighbourhood of the hyperbolic stagnation points of the base flow. As the second main result, we illustrate a fundamentally different, nonmodal, growth mechanism involving a continuous family of uncorrelated functions, instead of an eigenfunction of the linearized operator. Constructed by solving a suitable PDE optimization problem, the resulting flows saturate the known estimates on the growth of the semigroup related to the essential spectrum of the linearized Euler operator as the numerical resolution is refined. These findings are contrasted with the results of earlier studies of a similar problem conducted in a slightly viscous setting where only the modal growth of instabilities was observed. This highlights the special stability properties of equilibria in inviscid flows.</description>

      <title>Estimation of uncertainties in the density driven flow in fractured porous media using MLMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Multi Level Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainties in a Henry-like salt water intrusion problem with a fracture. The flow is induced by the variation of the density of the fluid phase, which depends on the mass fraction of salt. We assume that the fracture has a known fixed location but an uncertain aperture. Other input uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields and the recharge. In our setting, porosity and permeability vary spatially and recharge is time-dependent. For each realisation of these uncertain parameters, the evolution of the mass fraction and pressure fields is modelled by a system of non-linear and time-dependent PDEs with a jump of the solution at the fracture. The uncertainties propagate into the distribution of the salt concentration, which is an important characteristic of the quality of water resources. We show that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is able to reduce the overall computational cost compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by balancing discretisation and statistical errors. Multiple scenarios are evaluated at different spatial and temporal mesh levels. The deterministic solver ug4 is run in parallel to calculate all stochastic scenarios.</description>

      <title>A support preserving homotopy for the de Rham complex with boundary decay estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the de Rham complex of relative differential forms on compact manifolds with boundary. Chain homotopies for this complex are highly non-unique, and different homotopies can have different analytic properties, particularly near the boundary. We construct a chain homotopy that has desirable support propagation properties, and that satisfies estimates relative to weighted Sobolev norms, where the weights measure decay at the boundary. The estimates are optimal given the homogeneity properties of the de Rham differential under boundary dilation, and are obtained by showing that the homotopy is a b-pseudodifferential operator. As a corollary we obtain a right inverse of the divergence operator on Euclidean space that preserves support on large balls around the origin, and satisfies estimates that measure decay at infinity. Such a support preserving right inverse was constructed before by Bogovskii, but its mapping properties are not optimal with respect to decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We produce examples of solutions to the non-abelian gravitating vortex equations, which are a dimensional reduction of the K\"aher-Yang-Mills- Higgs equations. These are equations for a K\"ahler metric and a metric on a vector bundle. We consider a symmetric situation on a sphere with a relationship between the parameters involved (criticality), and perform a non-trivial reduction of the problem to a system of ordinary differential equations on the real line with complicated boundary conditions at infinity. This system involves a parameter whose dependence on the volume of the K\"ahler metric is non-explicit. We prove existence to this system using the method of continuity. We then prove that the parameter can be varied to make sure that all possible admissible volumes are attained.</description>

      <title>Interface motion from Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics of non-gradient type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on a $d$-dimensional periodic lattice of size $N$, that is, a stochastic time evolution of particles performing random walks with interaction subject to the exclusion rule (Kawasaki part), in general, of non-gradient type, together with the effect of the creation and annihilation of particles (Glauber part) whose rates are set to favor two levels of particle density, called sparse and dense. We then study the limit of our dynamics under the hydrodynamic space-time scaling, that is, $1/N$ in space and a diffusive scaling $N^2$ for the Kawasaki part and another scaling $K=K(N)$, which diverges slower, for the Glauber part in time. In the limit as $N\to\infty$, we show that the particles autonomously make phase separation into sparse or dense phases at the microscopic level, and an interface separating two regions is formed at the macroscopic level and evolves under an anisotropic curvature flow.
  In the present article, we show that the particle density at the macroscopic level is well approximated by a solution of a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlinear diffusion term of divergence form and a large reaction term. Furthermore, by applying the results of Funaki, Gu and Wang [arXiv:2404.12234] for the convergence rate of the diffusion matrix approximated by local functions, we obtain a quantitative hydrodynamic limit as well as the upper bound for the allowed diverging speed of $K=K(N)$.
  The above result for the derivation of the interface motion is proved by combining our result with that in a companion paper by Funaki and Park [arXiv:2403.01732], in which we analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the reaction-diffusion equation obtained in the present article and derived an anisotropic curvature flow in the situation where the macroscopic reaction term determined from the Glauber part is bistable and balanced.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Approximation of the Fractional Porous Medium Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a finite element method for the numerical solution of a fractional porous medium equation on a bounded open Lipschitz polytopal domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $d = 2$ or $3$. The pressure in the model is defined as the solution of a fractional Poisson equation, involving the fractional Neumann Laplacian in terms of its spectral definition. We perform a rigorous passage to the limit as the spatial and temporal discretization parameters tend to zero and show that a subsequence of the sequence of finite element approximations defined by the proposed numerical method converges to a bounded and nonnegative weak solution of the initial-boundary-value problem under consideration. This result can be therefore viewed as a constructive proof of the existence of a nonnegative, energy-dissipative, weak solution to the initial-boundary-value problem for the fractional porous medium equation under consideration, based on the Neumann Laplacian. The convergence proof relies on results concerning the finite element approximation of the spectral fractional Laplacian and compactness techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations, together with properties of the equation, which are shown to be inherited by the numerical method. We also prove that the total energy associated with the problem under consideration exhibits exponential decay in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the nondegenerate case is well-known, there are only few results on the existence of strong solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs with coefficients of Nemytskii-type in the degenerate case. We consider a broad class of degenerate nonlinear Fokker-Planck(-Kolmogorov) equations with coefficients of Nemytskii-type. This includes, in particular, the classical porous medium equation perturbed by a first-order term with initial datum in a subset of probability densities, which is dense with respect to the topology inherited from $L^1$, and, in the one-dimensional setting, the classical porous medium equation with initial datum in an arbitrary point $x\in\mathbb{R}$. For these kind of equations the existence of a Schwartz-distributional solution $u$ is well-known. We show that there exists a unique strong solution to the associated degenerate McKean-Vlasov SDE with time marginal law densities $u$. In particular, every weak solution to this equation with time marginal law densities $u$ can be written as a functional of the driving Brownian motion.
  Moreover, plugging any Brownian motion into this very functional yields a weak solution with time marginal law densities $u$.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the hyperbolic-parabolic coupled system, arising from the generalized thermoelastic coupled system, in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$. We study some qualitative properties for an energy term by diagonalization procedures, and for the solution by the WKB analysis. Particularly, we derive new large time asymptotic profiles with the regularity-loss structure (from the biharmonic parabolic equation and the diffusion wave equation with the Riesz potential operator) and optimal decay estimates with suitable higher regularities for the Cauchy data. Finally, we discover that the wave equation with the Riesz potential dissipation is a large time approximated model of our hyperbolic-parabolic coupled system.</description>

      <title>Existence results for variational-hemivariational inequality systems with nonlinear couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a system of coupled inequalities consisting of a variational-hemivariational inequality and a quasi-hemivariational inequality on Banach spaces. The approach is topological, and a wide variety of existence results is established for both bounded and unbounded constraint sets in real reflexive Banach spaces. The main point of interest is that no linearity condition is imposed on the coupling functional, therefore making the system fully nonlinear. Applications to Contact Mechanics are provided in the last section of the paper. More precisely, we consider a contact model with (possibly) multivalued constitutive law whose variational formulation leads to a coupled system of inequalities. The weak solvability of the problem is proved via employing the theoretical results obtained in the previous section. The novelty of our approach comes from the fact that we consider two potential contact zones and the variational formulation allows us to determine simultaneously the displacement field and the Cauchy stress tensor.</description>

(CSS) is a self-dual $L^{2}$-critical equation having pseudoconformal invariance and solitons. In this paper, we show that any $m$-equivariant, $m\geq1$, $H^{3}$ finite-time blow-up solution to (CSS) is a pseudoconformal blow-up solution. More precisely, such a solution decomposes into the sum of one modulated soliton that contracts at the pseudoconformal rate $\lambda(t)\sim T-t$, and a radiation. Applying the pseudoconformal transform in reverse, we also obtain a refined soliton resolution theorem for $m$-equivariant, $m\geq1$, $H^{3,3}$ solutions: any such solutions blow up in the pseudoconformal regime, scatter (to $0$), or scatter to a modulated soliton with some fixed scale and phase. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the full classification of the dynamics of arbitrary smooth and spatially decaying solutions, including the dynamics of scale and phase, in the class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations which are not known to be completely integrable.
  Our analysis not only builds upon the previous works, especially the soliton resolution theorem by the author, Kwon, and Oh, but also refines all steps of the arguments typically employed in the forward construction of blow-up dynamics. The key feature of the proof is that we can identify the singular and regular parts of any $H^{3}$ finite-time blow-up solutions, such that the evolution of the singular part is governed by a universal modulation dynamics while the regular part is kept $H^{3}$-bounded even up to the blow-up time. As a byproduct, we also observe that the asymptotic profile has a universal singular structure.</description>

      <title>Higher order Boundary Schauder Estimates in Carnot Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his seminal 1981 study D. Jerison showed the remarkable negative phenomenon that there exist, in general, no Schauder estimates near the characteristic boundary in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb H^n$. On the positive side, by adapting tools from Fourier and microlocal analysis, he developed a Schauder theory at a non-characteristic portion of the boundary, based on the non-isotropic Folland-Stein H\"older classes. On the other hand, the 1976 celebrated work of Rothschild and Stein on their lifting theorem established the central position of stratified nilpotent Lie groups (nowadays known as Carnot groups) in the analysis of H\"ormander operators but, to present date, there exists no known counterpart of Jerison's results in these sub-Riemannian ambients. In this paper we fill this gap. We prove optimal $\Gamma^{k,\alpha}$ ($k\geq 2$) Schauder estimates near a $C^{k,\alpha}$ non-characteristic portion of the boundary for $\Gamma^{k-2, \alpha}$ perturbations of horizontal Laplacians in Carnot groups.</description>

      <title>On bilinear estimates and critical uniqueness classes for Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with bilinear estimates and uniqueness of mild solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations in critical spaces. For that, we construct general settings in which estimates for the bilinear term of the mild formulation hold true without using auxiliary norms such as Kato time-weighted ones. We first obtain necessary conditions in abstract critical spaces and then consider further structures to obtain the estimates in general classes of Besov, Morrey and Besov-Morrey spaces based on Banach spaces. Examples of applications are provided in different spaces as well as for other PDEs. In particular, as far as we know, the bilinear estimate and the uniqueness property obtained in the framework of Besov-weak-Herz spaces are not available in the existing literature. The proofs are mainly based on characterizations and estimates on the corresponding predual spaces.</description>

      <title>On Laplacian eigenvalue equation with constant Neumann boundary data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded Lipshcitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and we study boundary behaviors of solutions to the Laplacian eigenvalue equation with constant Neumann data. \begin{align}
  \label{cequation0} \begin{cases} -\Delta u=cu\quad &amp;\mbox{in $\Omega$}\\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=-1\quad &amp;\mbox{on $\partial \Omega$}. \end{cases} \end{align}First, by using properties of Bessel functions and proving new inequalities on elementary symmetric polynomials, we obtain the following inequality for rectangular boxes, balls and equilateral triangles: \begin{align} \label{bbb}
  \lim_{c\rightarrow \mu_2^-}c\int_{\partial \Omega}u_c\, d\sigma\ge \frac{n-1}{n}\frac{P^2(\Omega)}{|\Omega|}, \end{align}with equality achieved only at cubes and balls. In the above, $u_c$ is the solution to the eigenvalue equation and $\mu_2$ is the second Neumann Laplacian eigenvalue. Second, let $\kappa_1$ be the best constant for the Poincar\'e inequality with mean zero on $\partial \Omega$, and we prove that $\kappa_1\le \mu_2$, with equality holds if and only if $\int_{\partial \Omega}u_c\, d\sigma&gt;0$ for any $c\in (0,\mu_2)$. As a consequence, $\kappa_1=\mu_2$ on balls, rectangular boxes and equilateral triangles, and balls maximize $\kappa_1$ over all Lipschitz domains with fixed volume. As an application, we extend the symmetry breaking results from ball domains obtained in Bucur-Buttazzo-Nitsch[J. Math. Pures Appl., 2017], to wider class of domains, and give quantitative estimates for the precise breaking threshold at balls and rectangular boxes. It is a direct consequence that for domains with $\kappa_1&lt;\mu_2$, the above boundary limit inequality is never true, while whether it is valid for domains on which $\kappa_1=\mu_2$ remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behaviour of a run and tumble model which is a kinetic-transport equation describing bacterial movement under the effect of a chemical stimulus. The experiments suggest that the non-uniform tumbling kernels are physically relevant ones as opposed to the uniform tumbling kernel which is widely considered in the literature to reduce the complexity of the mathematical analysis. We consider two cases: (i) the tumbling kernel depends on the angle between pre- and post-tumbling velocities, (ii) the velocity space is unbounded and the post-tumbling velocities follow the Maxwellian velocity distribution. We prove that the probability density distribution of bacteria converges to an equilibrium distribution with explicit (exponential for (i) and algebraic for (ii)) convergence rates, for any probability measure initial data. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first results concerning the long-time behaviour of run and tumble equations with non-uniform tumbling kernels.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of regular solutions for 3-D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate viscosities and heat conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the degenerate viscous and heat conductive compressible fluids, the momentum equations and the energy equation are degenerate both in the time evolution and spatial dissipation when vacuum appears, and then the physical entropy S behaves singularly, which make it challenging to study the corresponding well-posedness of regular solutions with high order regularities of S near the vacuum. In this paper, for the physically important case that the coefficients of viscosities and heat conductivity depend on the absolute temperature \theta in a power law of Chapman-Enskog, we identify a class of initial data admitting a local-in-time regular solution with far field vacuum to the Cauchy problem of the 3-D full CNS, and such a solution possesses the uniformly high order regularities for S near the vacuum. The key idea here is to study the vacuum problem in terms of the mass density \rho, velocity u and S instead of (\rho, u,\theta), which makes it possible to compare the orders of the degeneracy of the time evolution and the spatial dissipations near the vacuum in terms of the powers of \rho. However, for heat conductive fluids, both a degenerate spatial dissipation and a source term related to \triangle \rho^{\gamma-1}, will appear in the time evolution equation for S, which makes it formidable to study the propagation of regularities of S. Fortunately, based on some elaborate analysis of the intrinsic degenerate-singular structures of the 3-D full CNS, we can choose proper weights to control the behaviors of (\rho, u,S) by introducing an enlarged reformulated system, which includes a singular parabolic system for u, and one degenerate-singular parabolic equation for S. Then one can carry out a series of weighted energy estimates carefully designed for this reformulated system, which provides an effective propagation mechanism for S's high order regularities near the vacuum.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider two types of damped wave equations: the weakly damped equation and the strongly damped equation. We recover the initial velocity from the trace of the solution on a space-time cylinder. This inverse problem is related to Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT), a hybrid medical imaging technique. PAT is based on generating acoustic waves inside of an object of interest and one of the mathematical problem in PAT is reconstructing the initial velocity from the solution of the wave equation measured on the outside of object. Using the spherical harmonics and spectral theorem, we demonstrate a way to recover the initial velocity.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the stability of an abstract thermoelastic system with Cattaneo's law, which describes finite heat propagation speed in a medium. We introduce a parameters region containing coupling, thermal dissipation, and possible inertial characteristics. The parameters region is partitioned into distinct subregions based on the spectral properties of the infinitesimal generator of the corresponding semigroup. By a careful estimation of the resolvent, we obtain distinct polynomial decay rates for systems with parameters located in different subregions. Furthermore, the optimality of these decay rates is proved. Finally, we apply our results to several coupled systems of partial differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate traveling wave solutions for a nonlinear system of two coupled reaction-diffusion equations characterized by double degenerate diffusivity: \[n_t= -f(n,b), \quad b_t=[g(n)h(b)b_x]_x+f(n,b).\] These systems mainly appear in modeling spatial-temporal patterns during bacterial growth. Central to our study is the diffusion term $g(n)h(b)$, which degenerates at $n=0$ and $b=0$; and the reaction term $f(n,b)$, which is positive, except for $n=0$ or $b=0$. Specifically, the existence of traveling wave solutions composed by a couple of strictly monotone functions for every wave speed in a closed half-line is proved, and some threshold speed estimates are given. Moreover, the regularity of the traveling wave solutions is discussed in connection with the wave speed.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Incompressible Limit of Current-Vortex Sheets with Surface Tension in Compressible Ideal MHD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current-vortex sheet is one of the characteristic discontinuities in ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The motion of current-vortex sheets is described by a free-interface problem of two-phase MHD flows with magnetic fields tangential to the interface. This model has been widely used in both solar physics and controlled nuclear fusion. This paper is the first part of the two-paper sequence, which aims to present a comprehensive study for compressible current-vortex sheets with or without surface tension. We prove the local well-posedness and the incompressible limit of current-vortex sheets with surface tension. The key observation is a hidden structure of Lorentz force in the vorticity analysis which motivates us to establish the uniform estimates in anisotropic-type Sobolev spaces with weights of Mach number determined by the number of tangential derivatives. Besides, we develop a robust framework for iteration and approximation to prove the local existence of vortex-sheet problems. Our method does not rely on Nash-Moser iteration nor tangential smoothing.</description>

      <title>Vanishing viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations in a horizontally periodic strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish vanishing viscosity limit of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a horizontally periodic strip. On the vertical direction, the horizontal component of the velocity is subjected to two different types of boundary conditions: at the lower boundary, we give the degenerate zero boundary condition, while at the upper boundary, a small smooth perturbation of non-zero constant is prescribed. Due to this different boundary condition setting, the boundary layer effects are different near the lower and upper boundaries, which result in different thickness of boundary layer and different leading order boundary layer equations. We will construct an approximate solution to this 2D Navier-Stokes equations by using higher order asymptotic approximation and show the validity of the boundary layer expansion. The leading order of the Euler solution is the Couette flow $(Ay,0)$ for some suitable constant $A$, which is determined by using the principle of the Prandtl-Batchelor theory.</description>

Abstract: We propose a systematic elementary approach based on trajectories to prove Poincar\'e inequalities for hypoelliptic equations with an arbitrary number of H\"ormander commutators, both in the local and in the non-local case. Our method generalises and simplifies the method introduced in Guerand-Mouhot (2022) in the local case with one commutator, and extended in Loher (2024) to the non-local case with one commutator. It draws inspiration from the paper Niebel-Zacher (2022), although we use different trajectories. We deduce Harnack inequalities and H\"older regularity along the line of the De Giorgi method. Our results recover those in Anceschi-Rebucci (2022) in the local case, and are new in the non-local case.</description>

      <title>Stability of fronts in the diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model in the situation when the prey diffuses at the rate much smaller than that of the predator. In a certain parameter regime, the existence of fronts in the system is known: the underlying dynamical system in a singular limit is reduced to a scalar Fisher-KPP equation and the fronts supported by the full system are small perturbations of the Fisher-KPP fronts. The existence proof is based on application of the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory with respect to two small parameters. This paper is focused on the stability of the fronts. We analyze the stability by means of energy estimates, exponential dichotomies, the Evans function calculation, and a technique that involves constructing the unstable augmented bundles. The energy estimates provide bounds on the unstable spectrum which depend on the small parameters of the system; the bounds are inversely proportional to these parameters. We further improve these estimates by showing that the eigenvalue problem is a small perturbation of some limiting (as the modulus of the eigenvalue parameter goes to infinity) system, and that the limiting system has exponential dichotomies. Persistence of the exponential dichotomies then leads to bounds uniform in the small parameters. The main novelty of this approach is related to the fact that the limit of the eigenvalue problem is not autonomous. We then use the concept of the unstable augmented bundles and by treating these as multiscale topological structures with respect to the same two small parameters consequently as in the existence proof, we show that the stability of the fronts is also governed by the scalar Fisher-KPP equation.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets in a pointed closed convex cone was proposed and a weak solution to this problem was provided. In smooth setting, this problem is equivalent to solving the Dirichlet problem for a class of Monge-Amp\`ere type equations. In this paper, we show the existence, regularity and uniqueness of solutions to this Monge-Amp\`ere type equation in the case $p\geq 1$ by studying variational properties for a family of Monge-Amp\`ere functionals. Moreover, the existence and optimal global H\"older regularity in the case $p&lt;1$ and $q\geq n$ is also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-degeneracy, stability and symmetry for the fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality states that $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{(u(x)-u(y))^2}{|x|^\alpha |x-y|^{n+2s} |y|^\alpha} \mathrm{d} x \, \mathrm{d} y
  \geq \Lambda_{n, s, p, \alpha,\beta}
  \|u |x|^{-\beta}\|_{L^p}^2, $$ for $0&lt;s&lt;\min\{1, n/2\}$, $2&lt;p&lt;2^*_s$, and $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb R$ so that $\beta-\alpha = s - n\big(\frac12 - \frac1p\big)$ and $-2s &lt; \alpha &lt; \frac{n-2s}{2}$.
  Continuing the program started in Ao et al. (2022), we establish the non-degeneracy and sharp quantitative stability of minimizers for $\alpha\ge 0$. Furthermore, we show that minimizers remain symmetric when $\alpha&lt;0$ for $p$ very close to $2$.
  Our results fit into the more ambitious goal of understanding the symmetry region of the minimizers of the fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality.
  We develop a general framework to deal with fractional inequalities in $\mathbb R^n$, striving to provide statements with a minimal set of assumptions. Along the way, we discover a Hardy-type inequality for a general class of radial weights that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>$C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of variational problems with a convexity constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the interior $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity of minimizers of a class of functionals with a convexity constraint, which includes the principal-agent problems studied by Figalli-Kim-McCann (\textit{J. Econom. Theory} \textbf{146} (2011), no. 2, 454-478). The $C^{1,1}$ regularity was previously proved by Caffarelli-Lions in an unpublished note when the cost is quadratic, and recently extended to the case where the cost is uniformly convex with respect to a general preference function by McCann-Rankin-Zhang(\textit{arXiv:2303.04937v3}). Our main result does not require the uniform convexity assumption on the cost function. In particular, we show that the solutions to the principal-agent problems with $q$-power cost are $C^{1,\frac{1}{q-1}}$ when $q &gt; 2$ and $C^{1,1}$ when $1&lt;q\leq 2$. Examples can show that this regularity is optimal when $q\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Fischer decompositions for entire functions of sufficiently low order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of decompositions of the form $f=P\cdot q+r$ with $P_k^{\ast}\left( D\right) r=0 $, where $f$ is entire, $P$ a polynomial and $P^{\ast}_k$ the principal part of $P$ with its coefficients conjugated, was achieved in \cite{AlRe23} under certain restrictions on the order of $f$. Here we prove uniqueness, thereby obtaining Fischer decompositions, under conditions that sometimes match those required for existence, and sometimes are more restrictive, depending on the parameters involved.</description>

      <title>Uniform vorticity depletion and inviscid damping for periodic shear flows in the high Reynolds number regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations linearized around a shear flow on a (non-square) torus which possesses exactly two non-degenerate critical points. We obtain linear inviscid damping and vorticity depletion estimates for the linearized flow that are uniform with respect to the viscosity, and enhanced dissipation type decay estimates. The main task is to understand the associated Rayleigh and Orr-Sommerfeld equations, under the natural assumption that the linearized operator around the shear flow in the inviscid case has no discrete eigenvalues. The key difficulty is to understand the behavior of the solution to Orr-Sommerfeld equations in three distinct regimes depending on the spectral parameter: the non-degenerate case when the spectral parameter is away from the critical values, the intermediate case when the spectral parameter is close to but still separated from the critical values, and the most singular case when the spectral parameter is inside the viscous layer.</description>

      <title>Normalized grounded states for a coupled nonlinear schr\"{o}dinger system on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of normalized ground states to the system of coupled Schr\"odinger equations: \begin{equation}\label{eq:0.1}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_1 + \lambda_1 u_1 = \mu_1 |u_1|^{p_1-2}u_1 + \beta r_1|u_1|^{r_1-2}u_1|u_2|^{r_2} &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{3},
  -\Delta u_2 + \lambda_2 u_2 = \mu_2|u_2|^{p_2-2}u_2 + \beta r_2|u_1|^{r_1}|u_2|^{r_2-2}u_2 &amp; \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^3,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation} subject to the constraints $\mathcal{S}_{a_1} \times \mathcal{S}_{a_2} = \{(u_1 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_1^2 dx = a_1^2\} \times \{(u_2 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3))|\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} u_2^2 dx = a_2^2\}$, where $\mu_1, \mu_2 &gt; 0$, $r_1, r_2 &gt; 1$, and $\beta \geq 0$. Our focus is on the coupled mass super-critical case, specifically, $$\frac{10}{3} &lt; p_1, p_2, r_1 + r_2 &lt; 2^* = 6.$$ We demonstrate that there exists a $\tilde{\beta} \geq 0$ such that equation (\ref{eq:0.1}) admits positive, radially symmetric, normalized ground state solutions when $\beta &gt; \tilde{\beta}$. Furthermore, this result can be generalized to systems with an arbitrary number of components, and the corresponding standing wave is orbitally unstable.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the Prandtl number and slip-length, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>

Abstract: We consider periodic homogenisation problems for gPAM, $\Phi^{4}_{3}$ and modified KPZ equations. Using Littlewood-Paley blocks, we establish para-products and commutator estimates for generalised Besov spaces associated with self-adjoint elliptic operators. With this, we show that, the homogenisation and renormalisation procedures commute in aforementioned models under suitable assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the viscous incompressible fluids in a three-dimensional horizontally periodic domain bounded below by a fixed smooth boundary and above by a free moving surface. The fluid dynamics are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations with the effect of gravity and surface tension on the free surface. We develop a global well-posedness theory by a nonlinear energy method in low regular Sobolev spaces with several techniques, including: the horizontal energy-dissipation estimates, a new tripled bootstrap argument inspired by Guo and Tice [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal.(2018)]. Moreover, the solution decays asymptotically to the equilibrium in an exponential rate.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity III: Early-Time Asymptotics for Higher $\ell$-Modes of Linear Waves on a Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.00035v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the early-time asymptotics for fixed-frequency solutions $\phi_\ell$ to the wave equation $\Box_g \phi_\ell=0$ on a fixed Schwarzschild background ($M&gt;0$) arising from the no incoming radiation condition on $\mathcal I^-$ and polynomially decaying data, $r\phi_\ell\sim t^{-1}$ as $t\to-\infty$, on either a timelike boundary of constant area radius (I) or an ingoing null hypersurface (II). In case (I), we show that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ along outgoing null hypersurfaces near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms at order $r^{-3-\ell}\log r$. In contrast, in case (II), we obtain that the asymptotic expansion of $\partial_v(r\phi_\ell)$ near spacelike infinity $i^0$ contains logarithmic terms already at order $r^{-3}\log r$ (unless $\ell=1$).
  These results suggest an alternative approach to the study of late-time asymptotics near future timelike infinity $i^+$ that does not assume conformally smooth or compactly supported Cauchy data: In case (I), our results indicate logarithmic modifications to Price's law for each $\ell$-mode. On the other hand, the data of case (II) lead to much stronger deviations from Price's law. In particular, we conjecture that compactly supported scattering data on $\mathcal H^-$ and $\mathcal I^-$ lead to solutions that exhibit the same late-time asymptotics on $\mathcal I^+$ for each $\ell$: $r\phi_\ell|_{\mathcal I^+}\sim u^{-2}$ as $u\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a piecewise-polynomial interpolant $u \mapsto \Pi u$ for functions $u:\Omega \setminus \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a Lipschitz polyhedron and $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ is a possibly non-manifold $(d-1)$-dimensional hypersurface. This interpolant enjoys approximation properties in relevant Sobolev norms, as well as a set of additional algebraic properties, namely, $\Pi^2 = \Pi$, and $\Pi$ preserves homogeneous boundary values and jumps of its argument on $\Gamma$. As an application, we obtain a bounded discrete right-inverse of the "jump" operator across $\Gamma$, and an error estimate for a Galerkin scheme to solve a second-order elliptic PDE in $\Omega$ with a prescribed jump across $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of the visual MacKay effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modelling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modelling the visual MacKay effect [Mackay, Nature 1957]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in Mackay's psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay's funnel pattern "MacKay rays". From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation's exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modelling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity IV: Linearised Gravity Around Schwarzschild -- An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the fourth in a series dedicated to the mathematically rigorous asymptotic analysis of gravitational radiation under astrophysically realistic setups. It provides an overview of the physical ideas involved in setting up the mathematical problem, the mathematical challenges that need to be overcome once the problem is posed, as well as the main new results we obtain in the companion paper [KM24].
  From the physical perspective, this includes a discussion of how Post-Newtonian theory provides a prediction on the gravitational radiation emitted by $N$ infalling masses from the infinite past in the intermediate zone, i.e. up to some finite advanced time.
  From the mathematical perspective, we then take this prediction, together with the condition that there be no incoming radiation from $\mathcal{I}^-$, as a starting point to set up a scattering problem for the linearised Einstein vacuum equations around Schwarzschild and near spacelike infinity, and we outline how to solve this scattering problem and obtain the asymptotic properties of the scattering solution near $i^0$ and $\mathcal{I}^+$.
  The full mathematical details are presented in the companion paper [KM24].</description>

      <title>Bayesian sampling using interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian sampling is an important task in statistics and machine learning. Over the past decade, many ensemble-type sampling methods have been proposed. In contrast to the classical Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, these new methods deploy a large number of interactive samples, and the communication between these samples is crucial in speeding up the convergence. To justify the validity of these sampling strategies, the concept of interacting particles naturally calls for the mean-field theory. The theory establishes a correspondence between particle interactions encoded in a set of coupled ODEs/SDEs and a PDE that characterizes the evolution of the underlying distribution. This bridges numerical algorithms with the PDE theory used to show convergence in time. Many mathematical machineries are developed to provide the mean-field analysis, and we showcase two such examples: The coupling method and the compactness argument built upon the martingale strategy. The former has been deployed to show the convergence of ensemble Kalman sampler and ensemble Kalman inversion, and the latter will be shown to be immensely powerful in proving the validity of the Vlasov-Boltzmann simulator.</description>

      <title>On Courant and Pleijel theorems for sub-Riemannian Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the number of nodal domains of eigenfunctions of sub-Laplacians on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we investigate the validity of Pleijel's theorem, which states that, as soon as the dimension is strictly larger than 1, the number of nodal domains of an eigenfunction corresponding to the k-th eigenvalue is strictly (and uniformly, in a certain sense) smaller than k for large k.
  In the first part of this paper we reduce this question from the case of general sub-Riemannian manifolds to that of nilpotent groups.
  In the second part, we analyze in detail the case where the nilpotent group is a Heisenberg group times a Euclidean space. Along the way we improve known bounds on the optimal constants in the Faber-Krahn and isoperimetric inequalities on these groups.</description>
