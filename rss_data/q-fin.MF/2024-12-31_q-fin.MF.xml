      <title>Rough differential equations for volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a canonical way of performing the joint lift of a Brownian motion $W$ and a low-regularity adapted stochastic rough path $\mathbf{X}$, extending [Diehl, Oberhauser and Riedel (2015). A L\'evy area between Brownian motion and rough paths with applications to robust nonlinear filtering and rough partial differential equations]. Applying this construction to the case where $\mathbf{X}$ is the canonical lift of a one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (possibly correlated with $W$) completes the partial rough path of [Fukasawa and Takano (2024). A partial rough path space for rough volatility]. We use this to model rough volatility with the versatile toolkit of rough differential equations (RDEs), namely by taking the price and volatility processes to be the solution to a single RDE. We argue that our framework is already interesting when $W$ and $X$ are independent, as correlation between the price and volatility can be introduced in the dynamics. The lead-lag scheme of [Flint, Hambly, and Lyons (2016). Discretely sampled signals and the rough Hoff process] is extended to our fractional setting as an approximation theory for the rough path in the correlated case. Continuity of the solution map transforms this into a numerical scheme for RDEs. We numerically test this framework and use it to calibrate a simple new rough volatility model to market data.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational Equitable Climate Change Mitigation: Negative Effects of Stochastic Interest Rates; Positive Effects of Financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's decisions on climate change mitigation affect the damage that future generations will bear. Discounting future benefits and costs of climate change mitigation is one of the most critical components of assessing efficient climate mitigation pathways. We extend the DICE model with stochastic discount rates to reflect the uncertain nature of discount rates. Stochastic rates give rise to a stochastic mitigation strategy, resulting in all model quantities becoming stochastic.
  We show that the optimization procedure of the DICE model induces intergenerational inequality: lacking a mechanism to regulate burden, future generations have to bear higher costs from abatement and damage relative to GDP.
  Further, we show that considering uncertainty of discount rates and their feedback to abatement policies, which can be interpreted as successive re-calculation, increases intergenerational inequality (and adds additional risks). Motivated by this, we consider additional financing risks by investigating two modifications of DICE. We find that allowing financing of abatement costs and considering non-linear financing effects for large damages improves intergenerational effort sharing. To conclude our discussion of options to improve intergenerational equity in an IAM, we propose a modified optimization to keep costs below 3% of GDP, resulting in more equal distribution of efforts between generations.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical CEV Option Pricing Model: an Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to obtain closed form solutions for the semiclassical (or WKB) approximation of the heat kernel propagator of the diffusion equation defined by the constant elasticity variance (CEV) option pricing model. One of the key points is that our calculations are based on the Van Vleck-Morette determinant instead of the Van Vleck determinant used by other authors. In fact, we compute this determinant in two different ways: by means of the solution of the classical Hamiltonian equations, and by solving the variational equations. Furthermore, the calculation reveals an exponential factor in the prefactor of the kernel not considered in previous works.</description>

      <title>Functional Limit Theorems for Hawkes Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the long-run behavior of Hawkes processes is fully determined by the average number and the dispersion of child events. For subcritical processes we provide FLLNs and FCLTs under minimal conditions on the kernel of the process with the precise form of the limit theorems depending strongly on the dispersion of child events. For a critical Hawkes process with weakly dispersed child events, functional central limit theorems do not hold. Instead, we prove that the rescaled intensity processes and rescaled Hawkes processes behave like CIR-processes without mean-reversion, respectively integrated CIR-processes. We provide the rate of convergence by establishing an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of rescaled Hawkes process and the corresponding limit process. By contrast, critical Hawkes process with heavily dispersed child events share many properties of subcritical ones. In particular, functional limit theorems hold. However, unlike subcritical processes critical ones with heavily dispersed child events display long-range dependencies.</description>
