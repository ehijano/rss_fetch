      <title>Novel indium phosphide charged particle detector characterization with a 120 GeV proton beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin film detectors which incorporate semiconductor materials other than silicon have the potential to build upon their unique material properties and offer advantages such as faster response times, operation at room temperature, and radiation hardness. To explore the possibility, promising candidate materials were selected, and particle tracking detectors were fabricated. An indium phosphide detector with a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure has been fabricated for particle tracking. The detector was tested using radioactive sources and a high energy proton beam at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. In addition to its simplistic design and fabrication process, the indium phosphide particle detector showed a very fast response time of hundreds of picoseconds for the 120 GeV protons, which are comparable to the ultra-fast silicon detectors. This fast-timing response is attributed to the high electron mobility of indium phosphide. Such material properties can be leveraged to build novel detectors with superlative performance.</description>

      <title>Development of Two-Dimensional Neutron Imager with a Sandwich Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a two-dimensional neutron imager based on a semiconductor pixelated sensor, especially designed for experiments measuring of a spatial and a temporal behavior of quantum bound states of ultra-cold neutrons. Through these measurements, we expect to measure the ratio between the inertial and gravitational masses of neutrons and to test the equivalence principle in the quantum regime. As one of the principal neutron imagers, we fabricated a sensor with a sandwich configuration, named 10B-INTPIX4-sw, and tested its response to ultra-cold neutrons at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). We observed simultaneous events on both sandwiching sensors without significant loss of detection efficiency. The efficiency was evaluated to be about 16%, relative to the 10B/ZnS reference detector. The coincidence condition reduces its efficiency by a factor of about 3.</description>

      <title>Testbeam results of irradiated SiGe BiCMOS monolithic silicon pixel detector without internal gain layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Samples of the monolithic silicon pixel ASIC prototype produced in 2022 within the framework of the Horizon 2020 MONOLITH ERC Advanced project were irradiated with 70 MeV protons up to a fluence of 1 x 1016 neq/cm2, and then tested using a beam of 120 GeV/c pions. The ASIC contains a matrix of 100 \mu m pitch hexagonal pixels, readout out by low noise and very fast frontend electronics produced in a 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology process. The dependence on the proton fluence of the efficiency and the time resolution of this prototype was measured with the frontend electronics operated at a power density between 0.13 and 0.9 W/cm2. The testbeam data show that the detection efficiency of 99.8% measured at sensor bias voltage of 200 V before irradiation becomes 96.5% after a fluence of 1 x 1016 neq/cm2. An increase of the sensor bias voltage to 300 V provides an efficiency to 99.5% at that proton fluence. The timing resolution of 20 ps measured before irradiation rises for a proton fluence of 1 x 1016 neq/cm2 to 48 and 44 ps at HV = 200 and 300 V, respectively.</description>

      <title>All-in-one Quantum Diamond Microscope for Sensor Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a leading modality for magnetic sensing and imaging under ambient conditions. However, these sensors suffer from degraded performance due to paramagnetic impurities and regions of stress in the diamond crystal lattice. This work demonstrates a quantum diamond microscope (QDM) for simultaneous mapping and spatial correlation of key properties of a millimeter-scale NV-diamond sensor chip, including: NV ensemble photoluminescence (PL) amplitude, spin-lattice relaxation time (T$_1$), and homogeneous and inhomogeneous spin coherence lifetimes (T$_2$ and T$_2^*$), as well as lattice stress/strain, birefringence magnitude, and birefringence angle of the diamond crystal.</description>

      <title>Near-Quantum-limited Haloscope Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter Enhanced by a High-Q Superconducting Cavit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new experimental results on the search for dark photons based on a near-quantum-limited haloscope equipped with a superconducting cavity. The loaded quality factor of the superconducting cavity is $6\times10^{5}$, so that the expected signal from dark photon dark matter can be enhanced by more than one order compared to a copper cavity. A Josephson parametric amplifier with a near-quantum-limited noise temperature has been utilized to minimize the noise during the search. Furthermore, a digital acquisition card based on field programmable gate arrays has been utilized to maximize data collection efficiency with a duty cycle being 100$\%$. This work has established the most stringent constraints on dark photons at around 26.965 $\mu$eV. In the future, our apparatus can be extended to search for other dark matter candidates, such as axions and axion-like particles, and scrutinize new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Radon Removal Commissioning of the PandaX-4T Cryogenic Distillation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T distillation system, designed for the removal of krypton and radon from xenon, is evaluated for its radon removal efficiency using a $^{222}$Rn source during the online distillation process. The PandaX-4T dark matter detector is employed to monitor the temporal evolution of radon activity. To determine the radon reduction factor, the experimental data of radon atoms introduced into and bypassed the distillation system is compared. The results indicate that the PandaX-4T distillation system achieves a radon reduction factor exceeding 190 at the flow rate of 10 slpm and the reflux ratio of 1.44. Gas-only online distillation process of a flow rate of 20 slpm is also conducted without observing significant reduction of radon levels in the detector. This observation suggests that the migration flow of radon atoms from the liquid phase to the gas phase is limited, and the flow rate of gas circulation and duration of the process are insignificant compared to the total xenon mass of 5.6 tons in the detector. This study provides the experimental data to support the efficient removal of radon at $\sim$Bq level using the PandaX-4T distillation system, which is the prerequisite of the radon background control in the detector. The further operation with higher flow rate will be applied for the upcoming science run in PandaX-4T.</description>
