      <title>Computationally efficient method for calculating electron-phonon coupling for high-throughput superconductivity search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a computationally inexpensive frozen phonon approach we have developed a technique which can be used to screen large unit cell materials and systems for enhanced superconducting critical temperatures. The method requires only density functional theory (DFT) calculated electronic band structures of phonon modes corresponding to atomic displacements for various materials. We have applied this method to well known conventional superconductors including MgB$_2$, H$_{3}$S and other hydrides as examples.</description>

      <title>Renormalized and iterative formalism of the Andreev levels within large multi-parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attain a renormalized and iterative expression of the Andreev level in a quantum-dot Josephson junction, which is bound to have significant implications due to several significant advantages. The renormalized form of the Andreev level not only allows us to extend beyond the limitations of small tunnel coupling, quantum dot energy, magnetic field, and mean-field Coulomb interaction but also enables the capturing of subgap levels that leak out of the superconducting gap into the continuous spectrum. Furthermore, the iterative form of the Andreev level provides an intuitive understanding of the spin-split and superconducting proximity effects of the superconducting leads. We find a singlet-doublet quantum phase transition (QPT) in the ground state due to the intricate competition between the superconducting and spin-split proximity effects, that differs from the typical QPT arising from the competition between the superconducting proximity effect (favoring singlet phase) and the quantum dot Coulomb interaction (favoring doublet phase). This QPT has a diverse phase diagram owing to the spin-split proximity effects which favors the doublet phase akin to the quantum-dot Coulomb interaction but can be also enhanced by the tunneling coupling like the superconducting proximity effect. Unlike the typical QPT, where tunnel coupling prefers singlet ground state, this novel QPT enables strong tunnel coupling to suppress the singlet ground state via the spin-split proximity effect, allowing a singlet-doublet-singlet transition with increasing tunnel coupling. Our renormalized and iterative formalism of the Andreev level is crucial for the electrostatic gate, external flux, and magnetic field modulations of the Andreev qubits.</description>

      <title>Calculated Unconventional Superconductivity via Charge Fluctuations in Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons on Kagome lattice exhibit a wealth of features including Dirac points, van Hove singularities and flatbands. When the Fermi level is placed at the van Hove saddle point, the Fermi surface is perfectly nested and a rich variety of electronic instabilities is known to occur. The material realization of such scenario is a recently discovered Kagome system CsV3Sb5 whose superconductivity near charge-density wave instability at low temperatures points to an unconventional, non-electron-phonon, pairing mechanism. Here we use a recently developed combination of density functional theory with momentum and frequency-resolved self-energies deduced from the so-called fluctuational-exchange-type random phase approximation to study charge fluctuation mediated pairing tendencies in CsV3Sb5. Based on our numerical diagonalization of the BCS gap equation, two competing solutions emerge from these calculations with A_{1g} (anisotropic s-wave-like) and B_{2g} (d_{x2-y2},d_{xy}-like) symmetries of the superconducting order parameter. Our evaluated Eliashberg spectral functions {\alpha}2F({\omega}) are purely due to electronic correlations; they were found to be strongly peaked in the vicinity of frequency 7 meV that sets the scale of charge fluctuations. The superconducting coupling constants for the leading pairing channels are estimated as a function of the nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction V, a well-known prime parameter of the extended Hubbard model. They were found in the range of 0.2-0.4 depending on V. We evaluate the superconducting T_{c} close to the values that are observed experimentally that point to the charge fluctuations to provide a substantial contribution to the pairing mechanism in CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Flux-Tunable Regimes and Supersymmetry in Twisted Cuprate Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals assembly allows for the creation of Josephson junctions in an atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) flakes that are twisted relative to each other. In a narrow range of angles close to $45^\circ$, the junction exhibits a regime where time-reversal symmetry can be spontaneously broken and it can be used to encode an inherently protected qubit called flowermon. In this work we investigate the physics emerging when two such junctions are integrated in a SQuID circuit threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the flowermon qubit regime is maintained up to a finite critical value of the magnetic field and, under appropriate conditions, it is protected against both charge and flux noise. For larger external fluxes, the interplay between the inherent twisted d-wave nature of the order parameter and the external magnetic flux enables the implementation of different artificial atoms, including a flux-biased protected qubit and a supersymmetric quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Physical properties and electronic structure of the two-gap superconductor V$_{2}$Ga$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of the physical properties and superconductivity of the binary intermetallic V2Ga5. Electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements show that V2Ga5 enters its superconducting state below Tsc = 3.5 K, with a critical field of Hc2,perp c(Hc2,para c) = 6.5(4.1) kOe. With H perp c, the peak effect was observed in resistivity measurements, indicating the ultrahigh quality of the single crystal studied. The resistivity measurements under high pressure reveal that the Tsc is suppressed linearly with pressure and reaches absolute zero around 20 GPa. Specific heat and muon spin relaxation measurements both indicate that the two-gap s-wave model best describes the superconductivity of V2Ga5. The spectra obtained from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements suggest that two superconducting gaps open at the Fermi surface around the Z and {\Gamma} points. These results are verified by first-principles band structure calculations. We therefore conclude that V2Ga5 is a phonon-mediated two-gap s-wave superconductor</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic equations for a U(N) invariant superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the appropriate set of hydrodynamic equations in a U(N) invariant superfluid that couple the dynamics of superflow and magnetization. In the special case when both the superfluid and normal velocities are zero, the hydrodynamic equations reduce to a generalized version of Landau-Lifshitz equation for ferromagnetism with U(N) symmetry. When both velocities are non-zero, there appears couplings between the superflow and magnetization dynamics, and the superfluid velocity no longer satisfies the irrotational condition. On the other hand, the magnitude of magnetization is no longer a constant of motion as was the case for the standard Landau-Lifshitz theory. In comparison with the simple superfluid, the first sound and second sounds are modified by a non-zero magnetization through various thermodynamic functions. For U(2) invariant superfluid, we get both (zero-) sound wave and a spin wave at zero temperature. It is found that the dispersion of spin wave is always quadratic, which is consistent with detailed microscopic analysis. In the Appendix, we show that the hydrodynamic equation for a U(N) invariant superfluid can be obtained from the general hydrodynamic equation with arbitrary internal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in ultraclean graphene Andreev interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium Andreev resonances in a voltage-biased graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (JJ). We observe periodic oscillations of resistance with maxima at multiples of the magnetic flux quantum (noninversion regime). As we increase the bias voltage, we further observe a transition point beyond which oscillations exhibit a $\pi$ phase shift (inversion regime) with maxima of resistance occuring at multiples of half-flux quantum. At this transition point, the frequency of the oscillations is doubled. We develop a model based on the coupling of the static Andreev bound states (ABSs) to the nonequilibrium Fermi surface of graphene to explain the observed noninversion to inversion crossovers. Our model associates these crossovers to microscopic phase-sensitive Andreev reflections which couple the normal and superfluid components of the current. Our findings show that multiterminal JJs can be used to engineer unconventional energy-phase relations such as those expected in the $\pi$-shifted ABSs without relying on quartet and Floquet physics. These nonequilibrium ABSs could potentially find applications in superconducting $\pi$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Fundamental role of nonlocal orders in 1D Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal order parameters capture the presence of correlated fluctuations between specific degrees of freedom, in otherwise disordered quantum matter. Here we provide a further example of their fundamental role, deriving the ground state phase diagram of the filling one extended Bose Hubbard model exclusively in terms of their ordering. By means of a density matrix renormalization group numerical analysis, we show that besides the (even) parity order characteristic of the Mott insulating phase, and the string order non vanishing in the Haldane insulator, the recently proposed odd parity order completes the picture, becoming nonvanishing at the transition from the normal superfluid to the paired superfluid phase. The above three nonlocal parameters capture all the distinct phases, including the density wave phase which local order is seen as the simultaneous presence of correlated fluctuations in different channels. They provide a unique tool for the experimental observation of the full phase diagram of strongly correlated quantum matter, by means of local density measurements.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in selected Binary Tree States: Dicke/Total spin states, particle number projected BCS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Tree States (BTS) are states whose decomposition on a quantum register basis formed by a set of qubits can be made sequentially. Such states sometimes appear naturally in many-body systems treated in Fock space when a global symmetry is imposed, like the total spin or particle number symmetries. Examples are the Dicke states, the eigenstates of the total spin for a set of particles having individual spin $1/2$, or states obtained by projecting a BCS states onto particle number, also called projected BCS in small superfluid systems. Starting from a BTS state described on the set of $n$ qubits or orbitals, the entanglement entropy of any subset of $ k$ qubits is analyzed. Specifically, a practical method is developed to access the $k$ qubits/particles von Neumann entanglement entropy of the subsystem of interest. Properties of these entropies are discussed, including scaling properties, upper bounds, or how these entropies correlate with fluctuations. Illustrations are given for the Dicke state and the projected BCS states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate topological superconductivity in the Rashba-Hubbard model, describing heavy-atom superlattice and van der Waals materials with broken inversion. We focus in particular on fillings close to the van Hove singularities, where a large density of states enhances the superconducting transition temperature. To determine the topology of the superconducting gaps and to analyze the stability of their surface states in the presence of disorder and residual interactions, we employ an fRG+MFT approach, which combines the unbiased functional renormalization group (fRG) with a real-space mean-field theory (MFT). Our approach uncovers a cascade of topological superconducting states, including $A_1$ and $B_1$ pairings, whose wave functions are of dominant $p$- and $d$-wave character, respectively, as well as a time-reversal breaking $A_1 + i B_1$ pairing. While the $A_1$ and $B_1$ states have first order topology with helical and flat-band Majorana edge states, respectively, the $A_1 + i B_1$ pairing exhibits second-order topology with Majorana corner modes. We investigate the disorder stability of the bulk superconducting states, analyze interaction-induced instabilites of the edge states, and discuss implications for experimental systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the effective low-energy fermionic theory of the Kondo-Kitaev model to leading order in the Kondo coupling. Our main goal is to understand the nature of the superconducting instability induced in the proximate metal due to its coupling to spin fluctuations of the spin liquid. The special combination of the low-energy modes of a graphene-like metal and the form of the interaction induced by the Majorana excitations of the spin liquid furnish chiral superconducting order with $p_x + \mathrm{i} p_y$ symmetry. Computing its response to a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge field moreover shows that this superconducting state is topologically non-trivial, characterized by a first Chern number of $\pm 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair-breaking edges of $d$-wave superconductors feature Andreev bound states at the Fermi energy. Since these states are energetically highly unfavorable they are susceptible to effects that shift them to finite energy. We investigate the free energy of two different mechanisms: spontaneous phase gradients in the superconducting order parameter and surface ferromagnetism caused by Fermi liquid interaction effects. We find that the surface magnetization appears at lower temperatures than the spontaneous current flow of the phase-crystal state. The magnetic state can, however, be energetically favorable at lower temperatures for sufficiently strong Fermi liquid effects. As a result, first-order transitions between the two states are possible, suggesting a rich low-temperature phase diagram in $d$-wave superconductors.</description>

Abstract: In this Reply we respond to the comment by Antipov et al. from Microsoft Quantum on Hess et al., PRL 130, 207001 (2023). Antipov et al. reported only a single simulation and claimed it did not pass the Microsoft Quantum topological gap protocol (TGP). They have provided no parameters or data for this simulation (despite request). Regardless, in this reply we demonstrate that the trivial bulk gap reopening mechanism outlined in Hess et al., in combination with trivial ZBPs, passes the TGP and therefore can result in TGP false positives.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium finite frequency resonances in differential quantum noise driven by Majorana interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium quantum noise $S^&gt;(\omega,V)$ measured at finite frequencies $\omega$ and bias voltages $V$ probes Majorana bound states in a host nanostructure via fluctuation fingerprints unavailable in average currents or static shot noise. When Majorana interference is brought into play, it enriches nonequilibrium states and makes their nature even more unique. Here we demonstrate that an interference of two Majorana modes via a nonequilibrium quantum dot gives rise to a remarkable finite frequency response of the differential quantum noise $\partial S^&gt;(\omega,V,\Delta\phi)/\partial V$ driven by the Majorana phase difference $\Delta\phi$. Specifically, at low bias voltages there develops a narrow resonance of width $\hbar\Delta\omega\sim\sin^2\Delta\phi$ at a finite frequency determined by $V$, whereas for high bias voltages there arise two antiresonances at two finite frequencies controlled by both $V$ and $\Delta\phi$. We show that the maximum and minimum of these resonance and antiresonances have universal fractional values, $3e^3/4h$ and $-e^3/4h$. Moreover, detecting the frequencies of the antiresonances provides a potential tool to measure $\Delta\phi$ in nonequilibrium experiments on Majorana finite frequency quantum noise.</description>
