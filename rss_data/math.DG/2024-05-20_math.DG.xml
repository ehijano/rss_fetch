      <title>A convergence result for Mean Curvature Flow of totally real submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a convergence result for the mean curvature flow starting from a totally real submanifold which is "almost minimal" in a precise, quantitative sense. This extends, and makes effective, a result of H. Li for the Lagrangian mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent Lie algebras obtained by quivers and Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nilpotent Lie groups with left-invariant metrics provide non-trivial examples of Ricci solitons. One typical example is given by the class of two-step nilpotent Lie algebras obtained from simple directed graphs. In this paper, however, we focus on the use of quivers to construct nilpotent Lie algebras. A quiver is a directed graph that allows loops and multiple arrows between two vertices. Utilizing the concept of paths within quivers, we introduce a method for constructing nilpotent Lie algebras from finite quivers without cycles. We prove that for all these Lie algebras, the corresponding simply-connected nilpotent Lie groups admit left-invariant Ricci solitons. The method we introduce constructs a broad family of Ricci soliton nilmanifolds with arbitrarily high degrees of nilpotency.</description>

      <title>Half-dimensional immersions into the para-complex projective space and Ruh-Vilms type theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study isometric immersions $f:M^n \to {\mathbb {C}^{\prime}}\!P^n$ of an $n$-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold $M^n$ into the $n$-dimensional para-complex projective space ${\mathbb {C}^{\prime}}\!P^n$. We study the immersion $f$ by means of a lift $\mathfrak f$ of $f$ into a quadric hypersurface in ${S^{2n+1}_{n+1}}$. We find the frame equations and compatibility conditions. We specialize these results to dimension $n = 2$ and a definite metric on $M^2$ in isothermal coordinates and consider the special cases of Lagrangian surface immersions and minimal surface immersions. We characterize surface immersions with special properties in terms of primitive harmonicity of the Gauss maps.</description>

      <title>Godbillon-Vey type functional for almost contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many contact metric manifolds are critical points of curvature functionals restricted to spaces of associated metrics. The Godbillon-Vey functional has never been considered in a variational context in contact geometry. Recently we extended this functional from foliations to arbitrary plane fields on a 3-dimensional manifold, so, the following question arises: can one use the Godbillon-Vey functional to find optimal almost contact manifolds? In the paper, we introduce a Godbillon-Vey type functional for a 3-dimensional almost contact manifold and find its Euler-Lagrange equations for all variations preserving the Reeb vector field. We construct critical (for our functional) 3-dimensional almost contact manifolds having a double-twisted product structure, these solutions belong to the class $C_{5}\oplus C_{12}$ according to Chinea-Gonzalez classification.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the area functional on spaces with lower Ricci bounds and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove convergence results w.r.t. the area functional on metric measure spaces with a lower Ricci curvature bound. The paper can be divided in two parts. In the first part, we show that the heat flow provides good approximation properties for the area functional on $RCD(K,\infty)$ spaces, implying that in this setting the area formula for functions of bounded variation holds and that the area functional coincides with its relaxation. Moreover, we obtain partial regularity and uniqueness results for functions whose epigraphs are perimeter minimizing. In the second part of the paper, we consider Ricci limit spaces (and also finite dimensional $RCD(K,N)$ spaces for some results) and we show that, thanks to the previously obtained properties, minimizers of the area functional can be approximated with minimizers along the converging sequence of manifolds. As a first application, we show that minimizers of the area functional on non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces are locally Lipschitz and satisfy a-priori gradient estimates. Secondly, we obtain a Bernstein-type result for area minimizers with sublinear growth at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact K\"ahler manifold with no non-trivial holomorphic vector field, assume it admits a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric. Fix finitely many points, we show the existence of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics of Poincar\'e type on the complement of these points in the compact manifold.</description>

      <title>The sign of scalar curvature on K\"ahler blowups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $(M,\omega)$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold with positive/negative scalar curvature, then the blowup of $M$ at any point also furnishes a positive/negative scalar curvature K\"ahler metric in classes which make the exceptional divisor small. In the case of K\"ahler surfaces with positive scalar curvature, this extends a result of N. Hitchin to surfaces and answers a conjecture of C. LeBrun in the affirmative, as a result completing the classification of such surfaces.</description>

      <title>On ergodic properties of geodesic flows on uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on ergodic properties of the geodesic flow on a $C^\infty$ uniform visibility manifold $M$ without conjugate points. If $M$ is a closed surface of genus at least two without conjugate points, and with continuous Green bundles and bounded asymptote, we study the geometric properties of singular geodesics and show that if all singular geodesics are closed, then there are at most finitely many isolated singular closed geodesics and finitely many generalized strips. In particular, the geodesic flow is ergodic with respect to Liouville measure under the above assumption.
  Let $(M,g)$ be a closed uniform visibility manifold without conjugate points and $X$ its universal cover. Under the entropy gap assumption, the geodesic flow has a unique measure of maximal entropy (MME for short) by \cite[Theorem 1.2]{MR}. We develop a Patterson-Sullivan construction of this unique MME and show that it has local product structure, is fully supported, and has the Bernoulli property.
  If we assume further that $M$ has continuous Green bundles and the geodesic flow has a hyperbolic periodic point, using the nonuniform hyperbolic structure on an open dense subset and the symbolic approach developed in \cite{LP}, we show that for any H\"{o}lder continuous function, the equilibrium state is unique under the pressure gap condition.
  Under the same conditions above, we apply the mixing properties of the MME to count the number of free-homotopy classes containing a closed geodesic, as well as the volume asymptotics of Riemannian balls in the universal cover. We then obtain some rigidity results involving the Margulis function.
  Finally, for a uniform visibility manifold $M=X/\Gamma$ (not necessarily compact) without conjugate points, we show that if $\Gamma$ is non-elementary and contains an expansive isometry, then the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy holds.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Tangent Spaces on Causal Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand on previous work describing partial derivatives and metric component estimators to define tangent spaces on causal sets. Partial derivative operators are the basis vectors of the tangent space, and the metric defines the inner product. First, we use partial derivatives of the metric components to define the connection and partial derivatives of the connection to define the curvature. Numerical results show that both of these approach the expected values for a flat spacetime as density increases. Then we used the connection to define parallel transport and geodesics.</description>

      <title>Linear Singer-Hopf conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Singer-Hopf conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, {P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf ${P}$ on $X$.
  To prove the main result, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms. Then using techniques from non-abelian Hodge theories in both archimedean and non-archimedean settings, we deduce the desired positivity from the geometry of pure and mixed period maps.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives an alternate, elementary proof of a result of Magnani: maps between Carnot groups that are continuously differential in horizontal directions in the Euclidean sense are continuously Pansu differentiable. Our proof involves primarily Euclidean arguments. We simultaneously reprove Magnani's mean value estimate for continuously Pansu differentiable maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.12497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry and partial differential equations arising from the consideration of group-determinants, and representation theory. The simplest and most striking such example is undoubtedly that of the Humbert operator, associated with the cyclic group Z/3Z. This operator appears as a natural extension of the Laplacian in dimension 2. Another originality of our work is to show that the spectral theory of operators associated with Frobenius determinants is closely linked to finite Fourier transform theory.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study several closely related invariants associated to Dirac operators on odd-dimensional manifolds with boundary with an action of the compact group $H$ of isometries. In particular, the equality between equivariant winding numbers, equivariant spectral flow, and equivariant Maslov indices is established. We also study equivariant $\eta$-invariants which play a fundamental role in the equivariant analog of Getzler's spectral flow formula. As a consequence, we establish a relation between equivariant $\eta$-invariants and equivariant Maslov triple indices in the splitting of manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.09424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let the circle group act on a compact oriented manifold $M$ with a non-empty discrete fixed point set. Then the dimension of $M$ is even. If $M$ has one fixed point, $M$ is the point. In any even dimension, such a manifold $M$ with two fixed points exists, a rotation of an even dimensional sphere. Suppose that $M$ has three fixed points. Then the dimension of $M$ is a multiple of 4. Under the assumption that each isotropy submanifold is orientable, we show that if $\dim M=8$, then the weights at the fixed points agree with those of an action on the quaternionic projective space $\mathbb{HP}^2$, and show that there is no such 12-dimensional manifold $M$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that any bubble-sheet oval for the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^4$, up to scaling and rigid motion, either is the $\textrm{O}(2)\times \textrm{O}(2)$-symmetric ancient oval constructed by Hershkovits and the fourth author, or belongs to the one-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2\times \textrm{O}(2)$-symmetric ancient ovals constructed by the third and fourth author. In particular, this seems to be the first instance of a classification result for geometric flows that are neither cohomogeneity-one nor selfsimilar.</description>

      <title>Generic mean curvature flows with cylindrical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the dynamics of mean curvature flow as it approaches a cylindrical singularity. We reveal the mechanism for the isolatedness of cylindrical singularities in terms of the normal form of the asymptotic expansion of the rescaled mean curvature flow and formulate the notion of nondegeneracy of a cylindrical singularity.
  Our findings show that, generically, such a non-degenerate singularity is robust and isolated. In the presence of more complicated singularity sets such as in the example of a marriage ring, we demonstrate how to make the first-time singularity set a singleton by an arbitrarily small initial perturbation. These discoveries have implications for the level set flows' generic low regularity and the type-I nature of generic rotational MCFs. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of a ``firecracker'' type singularity and its significance in studying the isolatedness of cylindrical singularities. The research combines techniques and concepts from geometric flows, dynamical systems, and semilinear heat equations.</description>

Abstract: A new class of Riemannian metrics, called octonionic K\"ahler, is introduced and studied on a certain class of 16-dimensional manifolds. It is an octonionic analogue of K\"ahler metrics on complex manifolds and of HKT-metrics of hypercomplex manifolds. Then for this class of metrics an octonionic version of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation is introduced and solved under appropriate assumptions. The latter result is an octonionic version of the Calabi-Yau theorem from K\"ahler geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate metric Jordan algebras, and follow the lines of the paper (J. Milnor: Curvatures of left invariant metrics on Lie groups. Adv. Math. (1976)). Firstly, we define the Jordan-Levi-Civita connection, then we show that every metric Jordan algebra admits a unique Jordan-Levi-Civita connection. Secondly, using the Jordan-Levi-Civita connection, we introduce three natural curvature tensors on metric Jordan algebras, and obtain the corresponding curvature formulas. Thirdly, based on these curvature formulas, we prove that every formally real Jordan algebra admits both a metric of non-positive Jordan curvature, and a Jordan-Einstein metric of negative Jordan scalar curvature. Besides, for nilpotent Jordan algebras, we prove that they admit no Jordan-Einstein metrics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new volume comparison theorem for a complete manifold with a function $\rho(x)$ as the lower bound of the Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature bounds. As applications, we obtain a new volume rigidity result of the gradient Ricci almost soliton. Furthermore, we extend the results of Cao and Zhou \cite{CZ} to shrinking Ricci almost solitons and get the maximal volume rigidity result.</description>

      <title>Stability of Llarull's theorem in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Llarull's theorem characterizes the round sphere $S^n$ among all spin manifolds whose scalar curvature is bounded from below by $n(n-1)$. In this paper we show that if the scalar curvature is bounded from below by $n(n-1)-\varepsilon$, the underlying manifold is $C^0$-close to a finite number of spheres outside a small bad set. This completely solves Gromov's spherical stability problem.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean analogue of the space of valuations on convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two decades a number of structures on the classical space of translation invariant valuations on convex bodies were discovered, e.g. product, convolution, a Fourier type transform. In this paper a non-Archimedean analogue of the space of such (even) valuations with similar structures is constructed. It is shown that, like in the classical case, the new space equipped with either product or convolution satisfies Poincar\'e duality and hard Lefschetz theorem.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Lorentzian and Flat Affine Geometry of $\mathsf{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the geometry of the connected unit component of the real general linear Lie group $4$ dimensional $G_0$ as a Lorentzian and flat affine manifold. As the group $G_0$ is naturally equipped with a bi-invariant Hessian metric $k^+$, relative to a bi-invariant flat affine structure $\nabla$, we examine both structures and the relationships between them. Both structures are defined using the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, the first one through the trace $k(u,v):=\mathrm{trace}(u\circ v)$ and the second by the composition $\nabla_{u^+}v^+:=(u\circ v)^+$, where $u,v\in\mathfrak{g}$. The curvatures, tidal force, and Jacobi vector fields of $(G_0, k^+)$ are determined in Section 1. Section 2 discusses the causal structure of $k^+$, while Section 3 focuses on the developed map relative to $\nabla$ in the sense of C. Ehresmann.</description>

      <title>Zimmer's conjecture for non-uniform lattices: escape of mass and growth of cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish finiteness of low-dimensional actions of lattices in higher-rank semisimple Lie groups and establish Zimmer's conjecture for many such groups. This builds on previous work of the authors handling the case of actions by cocompact lattices and of actions by $\Sl(n,\Z)$. While the results are not sharp in all cases, they do dramatically improve all known results. The key difficulty overcome in this paper concerns escape of mass when taking limits of sequences of measures. Due to a need to control Lyapunov exponents for unbounded cocycles when taking such limits, quantitative controls on the concentration of mass at infinity are need and novel techniques are introduced to avoid ``escape of Lyapunov exponent."</description>

      <title>Almost periodic and Asymptotically Almost Periodic Navier-Stokes flows on non-compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic (AP-) and asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies negative and bounded conditions on Ricci curvature tensor. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of AP- and AAP- mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the ones for Navier-Stokes equations obtained in \cite{Xuan2022}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give applications of equivariant Gromov--Hausdorff convergence in various contexts. Namely, using equivariant Gromov--Hausdorff convergence, we prove a stability result in the setting of compact finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces. Moreover, we introduce the notion of an \emph{almost commutative diagram} and show that its use simplifies both exposition and argument.</description>
