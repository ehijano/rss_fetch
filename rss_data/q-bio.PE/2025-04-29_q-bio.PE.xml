      <title>PhyloProfile v2 -- Exploring multi-layered phylogenetic profiles at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic profiles visualize the presence-absence pattern of genes across taxa and are essential for delineating the evolutionary fate of genes and gene families. Integrating phylogenetic profiles across many genes and taxa reveals patterns of coevolution, aiding the predictions of gene functions and interactions. The surge of genome sequences generated by biodiversity genomics projects allows to compile phylogenetic profiles at an unprecedented scale. PhyloProfile v2 was designed to cope with the novel challenges of visualizing and analyzing phylogenetic profiles comprising millions of pairwise orthology relationships. By providing the ability to interact with the visualization and dynamically filter the data, PhyloProfile v2 facilitates a seamless transition from survey analyses across thousands of genes and taxa down to the feature architecture comparison of two ortholog pairs within the same analysis. As one key innovation, PhyloProfile v2 allows the display of phylogenetic profiles in 2D or 3D using dimensionality reduction techniques. This novel perspective eases, for example, the identification of taxa with similar presence/absence patterns of genes irrespective of their phylogenetic relationships. PhyloProfile v2 is available as an R package at Bioconductor https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.PhyloProfile.

      <title>Warming demands extensive tropical but minimal temperate management in plant-pollinator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anthropogenic warming impacts ecological communities and disturbs species interactions, particularly in temperature sensitive plant pollinator networks. While previous assessments indicate that rising mean temperatures and shifting temporal variability universally elevate pollinator extinction risk, many studies often overlook how plant-pollinator networks of different ecoregions require distinct management approaches. Here, we integrate monthly near-surface temperature projections from various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways of CMIP6 Earth System Models with region-specific thermal performance parameters to simulate population dynamics in 11 plant pollinator networks across tropical, temperate, and Mediterranean ecosystems. Our results show that tropical networks, already near their thermal limits, face pronounced (50 percent) pollinator declines under high-emissions scenarios (SSP5-8.5). Multi-species management targeting keystone plants emerges as a critical strategy for stabilizing these high risk tropical systems, boosting both pollinator abundance and evenness. In contrast, temperate networks remain well below critical temperature thresholds, with minimal (5 percent) pollinator declines and negligible gains from any intensive management strategy. These findings challenge single-species models and uniform-parameter frameworks, which consistently underestimate tropical vulnerability while overestimating temperate risk. We demonstrate that explicitly incorporating complex network interactions, region-specific thermal tolerances, and targeted multi species interventions is vital for maintaining pollination services. By revealing when and where limited interventions suffice versus extensive management becomes indispensable, our study provides a clear blueprint for adaptive, ecosystem specific management under accelerating climate change.</description>

      <title>Stochastic epidemic models with varying infectivity and waning immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04667v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an individual-based stochastic epidemic model in which infected individuals become susceptible again following each infection. In contrast to classical compartment models, after each infection, the infectivity is a random function of the time elapsed since one's infection. Similarly, recovered individuals become gradually susceptible after some time according to a random susceptibility function. We study the large population asymptotic behaviour of the model, by proving a functional law of large numbers (FLLN) and investigating the endemic equilibria properties of the limit. The limit depends on the law of the susceptibility random functions but only on the mean infectivity functions. The FLLN is proved by constructing a sequence of i.i.d. auxiliary processes and adapting the approach from the theory of propagation of chaos. The limit is a generalisation of a PDE model introduced by Kermack and McKendrick, and we show how this PDE model can be obtained as a special case of our FLLN limit.% for a particular set of infectivity and susceptibility random functions and initial conditions. For the endemic equilibria, if $ R_0 $ is lower than (or equal to) some threshold, the epidemic does not last forever and eventually disappears from the population, while if $ R_0 $ is larger than this threshold, the epidemic will not disappear and there exists an endemic equilibrium. The value of this threshold turns out to depend on the harmonic mean of the susceptibility a long time after an infection, a fact which was not previously known.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion conditioned on a single ancestral founder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the distributional properties of a Feller diffusion $(X(\tau))_{\tau \in [0, t]}$ conditioned on the current population $X(t)$ having a single ancestor at time zero. The approach is novel and is based on an interpretation of Feller's original solution according to which the current population is comprised of a Poisson number of exponentially distributed families, each descended from a single ancestor. The distribution of the number of ancestors at intermediate times and the joint density of coalescent times is determined under assumptions of initiation of the process from a single ancestor at a specified time in the past, including infinitely far in the past, and for the case of a uniform prior on the time since initiation. Also calculated are the joint distribution of the time since the most recent common ancestor of the current population and the contemporaneous population size at that time under different assumptions on the time since initiation. In each case exact solutions are given for supercritical, critical and subcritical diffusions. For supercritical diffusions asymptotic forms of distributions are also given in the limit of unbounded exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-inspired PDE model for airborne infectious disease transmission: analysis and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE) models for infectious disease have received renewed interest in recent years. Most models of this type extend classical compartmental formulations with additional terms accounting for spatial dynamics, with Fickian diffusion being the most common such term. However, while diffusion may be appropriate for modeling vector-borne diseases, or diseases among plants or wildlife, the spatial propagation of airborne diseases in human populations is heavily dependent on human contact and mobility patterns, which are not necessarily well-described by diffusion. By including an additional chemotaxis-inspired term, in which the infection is propagated along the positive gradient of the susceptible population (from regions of low- to high-density of susceptibles), one may provide a more suitable description of these dynamics. This article introduces and analyzes a mathematical model of infectious disease incorporating a modified chemotaxis-type term. The model is analyzed mathematically and the well-posedness of the resulting PDE system is demonstrated. A series of numerical simulations are provided, demonstrating the ability of the model to naturally capture important phenomena not easily observed in standard diffusion models, including propagation over long spatial distances over short time scales and the emergence of localized infection hotspots</description>

      <title>Epidemic outbreaks in structured host populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a heterogeneous host population, the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease, $\cR_0$, is defined as the spectral radius of the next generation operator (NGO). The threshold properties of the basic reproduction number are typically established by imposing conditions that make $\cR_0$ an eigenvalue of the NGO associated with a positive eigenvector and a positive eigenfunctional (eigenvector of the dual of the NGO). More general results can be obtained by imposing conditions that associate $\cR_0$ just with a positive eigenfunctional. The next generation operator is conveniently expressed by a measure kernel or a Feller kernel which enables the use of analytic rather than functional analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Societies via Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are typically constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. We propose a methodology that enables simulating populations of Reinforcement Learning agents at evolutionary scale. More specifically, we derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Policy Gradient (PG) and Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), tailored for evolutionary simulations where agents undergo random pairwise interactions in stateless normal-form games. We demonstrate our approach by simulating the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. In our experiments, 200,000 PG or LOLA agents evolve in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game provides distinct insights into how populations evolve under both naive and advanced MARL rules, including compelling ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects social evolution.</description>

      <title>Phenotype-structuring of non-local kinetic models of cell migration driven by environmental sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of cells to form surface extensions to non-locally probe the surrounding environment plays a key role in cell migration. The existing mathematical models for migration of cell populations driven by this non-local form of environmental sensing rely on the simplifying assumption that cells in the population share the same cytoskeletal properties, and thus form surface extensions of the same size. To overcome this simplification, we develop a kinetic modelling framework wherein a population of migrating cells is structured by a continuous phenotypic variable that captures variability in structural properties of the cytoskeleton. This framework provides a multiscale representation of cell migration, from single-cell dynamics to population-level behaviours, as we start with a microscopic model that describes the dynamics of single cells in terms of stochastic processes. Next, we formally derive the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which consists of a phenotype-structured kinetic equation that features a phenotype-dependent non-locality. Then, considering an appropriately rescaled version of this kinetic equation, we formally derive the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a partial differential equation for the cell number density. To validate the formal procedures employed to derive the macroscopic model from the microscopic model, through the mesoscopic one, we first compare the results of numerical simulations of the two models. We then compare numerical solutions of the macroscopic model with the results of cell locomotion assays, to test the ability of the model to recapitulate qualitative features of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>

      <title>Heterogenous graph neural networks for species distribution modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) are necessary for measuring and predicting occurrences and habitat suitability of species and their relationship with environmental factors. We introduce a novel presence-only SDM with graph neural networks (GNN). In our model, species and locations are treated as two distinct node sets, and the learning task is predicting detection records as the edges that connect locations to species. Using GNN for SDM allows us to model fine-grained interactions between species and the environment. We evaluate the potential of this methodology on the six-region dataset compiled by National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) for benchmarking SDMs. For each of the regions, the heterogeneous GNN model is comparable to or outperforms previously-benchmarked single-species SDMs as well as a feed-forward neural network baseline model.</description>
