      <title>A Sharper Upper Bound for the Separating Words Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any two distinct words $ s_1, s_2 $ over an arbitrary alphabets, there exists a deterministic finite automaton with $ O(\log^2 n) $ states that accepts $ s_1 $ and rejects $ s_2 $. This improves the previous upper bound of $O(n^{1/3}\log^7 n)$</description>

      <title>Determinization of Min-Plus Weighted Automata is Decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the determinization problem for min-plus (tropical) weighted automata is decidable, thus resolving this long-standing open problem. In doing so, we develop a new toolbox for analyzing and reasoning about the run-structure of nondeterministic automata.</description>

      <title>The 2-Token Theorem: Recognising History-Deterministic Parity Automata Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: History-determinism is a restricted notion of nondeterminism in automata, where the nondeterminism can be successfully resolved based solely on the prefix read so far. History-deterministic automata still allow for exponential succinctness in automata over infinite words compared to deterministic automata (Kuperberg and Skrzypczak, 2015), allow for canonical forms unlike deterministic automata (Abu Radi and Kupferman, 2019 and 2020; Ehlers and Schewe, 2022), and retain some of the algorithmic properties of deterministic automata, for example for reactive synthesis (Henzinger and Piterman, 2006; Ehlers and Khalimov, 2024).
  Despite the topic of history-determinism having received a lot of attention over the last decade, the complexity of deciding whether a parity automaton is history-deterministic has, up till now, remained open. We show that history-determinism for a parity automaton with a fixed parity index can be checked in PTIME, thus improving upon the naive EXPTIME upper bound of Henzinger and Piterman that has stood since 2006. More precisely, we show that the so-called 2-token game, which can be solved in PTIME for parity automata with a fixed parity index, characterises history-determinism for parity automata. This game was introduced by Bagnol and Kuperberg in 2018, who showed that to decide if a B\"uchi automaton is history-determinism, it suffices to find the winner of the 2-token game on it. They conjectured that this 2-token game based characterisation extends to parity automata. Boker, Kuperberg, Lehtinen, and Skrzypcak showed in 2020 that this conjecture holds for coB\"uchi automata as well. We prove Bagnol and Kuperberg's conjecture that the winner of the 2-token game characterises history-determinism on parity automata.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic analysis of systems with affine input and polynomial state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide exact and terminating algorithms for the formal analysis of deterministic continuous-time control systems with affine input and polynomial state dynamics (in short, polynomial systems). We consider the following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input independence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess series, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems via their formal generating series.
  Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic properties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on generating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial systems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear generalisation of Sch\"utzenberger's rational series which has recently been studied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We exploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite series (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the semantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for polynomial systems. Some of our analyses rely on a novel technical contribution, namely that shuffle-finite series are closed under support restrictions with commutative regular languages, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound on Unambiguous Context Free Grammars via Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent connections to factorised databases, we analyse the efficiency of representations by context free grammars (CFGs). Concretely, we prove a recent conjecture by Kimelfeld, Martens, and Niewerth (ICDT 2025), that for finite languages representations by general CFGs can be doubly-exponentially smaller than those by unambiguous CFGs. To do so, we show the first exponential lower bounds for representation by unambiguous CFGs of a finite language that can efficiently be represented by CFGs. Our proof first reduces the problem to proving a lower bound in a non-standard model of communication complexity. Then, we argue similarly in spirit to a recent discrepancy argument to show the required communication complexity lower bound. Our result also implies that a finite language may admit an exponentially smaller representation as a nondeterministic finite automaton than as an unambiguous CFG.</description>

      <title>On linguistic subsets of groups and monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study subsets of groups and monoids defined by language-theoretic means, generalizing the classical approach to the word problem. We expand on results by Herbst from 1991 to a more general setting, and for a class of languages $\mathbf{C}$ we define the classes of $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat and $\mathbf{C}^\exists$-flat groups. We prove several closure results for these classes of groups, prove a connection with the word problem, and characterize $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat groups for several classes of languages. In general, we prove that the class of $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flat groups is a strict subclass of the class of groups with word problem in $\mathbf{C}$, including for the class $\mathbf{REC}$ of recursive languages, for which $\mathbf{C}^\forall$-flatness for a group resp. monoid is proved to be equivalent to the decidability of the subgroup membership problem resp. the submonoid membership problem. We provide a number of examples, including the Tarski monsters of Ol'shanskii, showing the difficulty of characterizing $\mathbf{C}^\exists$-flat groups. As an application of our general methods, we also prove in passing that if $\mathbf{C}$ is a full semi-$\mathrm{AFL}$, then the class of epi-$\mathbf{C}$ groups is closed under taking finite index subgroups. This answers a question recently posed by Al Kohli, Bleak &amp; Elliott.</description>
