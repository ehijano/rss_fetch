      <title>Sensitivity of Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering observables to GPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) are multidimensonal structure functions that encode the information about the internal structure of hadrons. Using privileged channels such as Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) or Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS), it is possible to make direct measurements at points where the momentum fraction of the parton equals the respective scaling variable. Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) is a not yet measured and promising channel for GPD studies as it allows to perform more general measurements at independent momentum fraction and scaling variable values. GPDs are extracted from Compton Form Factors which arise naturally in experimental observables from different combinations of beam and target configurations. In the context of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and the Electron Ion Collider (EIC), we report the results of an exhaustive study of the DDVCS observables from polarized electron and positron beams directed to a polarized proton target. The study focuses on the sensitivity of the observables to the parton helicity conserving proton GPDs, particularly the consequences for GPDs measurements via DDVCS at CEBAF and EIC based on the VGG and GK19 model predictions.</description>

      <title>Advancing Tritium Self-Sufficiency in Fusion Power Plants: Insights from the BABY Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of fusion power, achieving tritium self-sufficiency stands as a pivotal challenge. Tritium breeding within molten salts is a critical aspect of next-generation fusion reactors, yet experimental measurements of \gls{tbr} have remained elusive. Here we present the results of the \gls{baby} experiment, which represents a pioneering effort in tritium research by utilizing high-energy (\SI{14}{\mega\electronvolt}) neutron irradiation of molten salts, a departure from conventional low-energy neutron approaches. Using a small-scale (\SI{100}{\milli\litre}) molten salt tritium breeding setup, we not only simulated, but also directly measured a \gls{tbr}. This innovative approach provides crucial experimental validation, offering insights unattainable through simulation alone. Moreover, our findings reveal a surprising outcome: tritium was predominantly collected as HT, contrary to the expected TF. This underscores the complexity of tritium behavior in molten salts, highlighting the need for further investigation. This work lays the foundation for a more sophisticated experimental setup, including increasing the volume of the breeder, enhancing neutron detection, and refining tritium collection systems. Such improvements are crucial for advancing our understanding of fusion reactor feasibility and paving the way for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Overview of the latest ALICE UPC and photonuclear results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) are events characterised by large impact parameters between the two projectiles, larger than the sum of their radii. In UPCs, the protons and ions accelerated by the LHC do not interact via the strong interaction and can be regarded as sources of quasireal photons. Using the Run 2 data, the ALICE Collaboration has carried out various measurements of different final-state systems, such as exclusive four pion photoproduction as well as photoproduction of $K^+K^-$ pairs, measured for the first time in ultra-peripheral collisions. In addition, vector meson production in Pb--Pb provides the unique opportunity to carry out an analogy of the double-slit experiment at femtometre scales, owing to the interference between the production sources of the two lead nuclei. These results and prospects for UPC measurements using Run 3 data will be presented.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Shell Structure at $N=32$ and 34: Insights from Realistic Nuclear Forces and the Role of Tensor Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of nuclear shell structures at $N=32$ and 34 are studied in nuclei far from the stability line using effective interactions derived from realistic nuclear forces. The state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} in-medium similarity renormalization group method is used for this purpose. The calculated results are consistent with experimental observations, and predictions are made where experimental data are unavailable. The shell gaps are analyzed from the evolution of effective single-particle energies, and various facets of nuclear interaction, such as central, spin-orbit, and tensor parts, are addressed by spin-tensor decomposition of the effective interactions. The roles played by these components in the development of shell closure, particularly by the tensor components, were highlighted throughout the study. Then, we discussed the low-lying structure of the exotic $N=32$ isotones below Ca. The present work demonstrates essential components of nuclear force in shaping magic numbers far from stability and provides deeper insights into the structure of exotic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal angle correlations of muons produced via heavy-flavor decays in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular correlations between heavy-quarks provide a unique probe of the quark-gluon plasma created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Results are presented of a measurement of the azimuthal angle correlations between muons originating from semileptonic decays of heavy-quarks produced in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at the LHC. The muons are measured with transverse momenta and pseudorapidities satisfying $p_{\mathrm{T}}^\mu &gt; 4$ GeV and $|\eta^\mu|&lt;2.4$, respectively. The distributions of azimuthal angle separation, $\Delta\phi$, for muon pairs having pseudorapidity separation $|\Delta\eta|&gt;0.8$, are measured in different Pb+Pb centrality intervals and compared to the same distribution measured in $pp$ collisions at the same center-of-mass energy. Results are presented separately for muon pairs with opposite-sign charges, same-sign charges, and all pairs. A clear peak is observed in all $\Delta\phi$ distributions at $\Delta\phi\sim\pi$, consistent with the parent heavy-quark pairs being produced via hard-scattering processes. The widths of that peak, characterized using Cauchy-Lorentz fits to the $\Delta\phi$ distributions, are found to not vary significantly as a function of Pb+Pb collision centrality and are similar for $pp$ and Pb+Pb collisions. This observation will provide important constraints on theoretical descriptions of heavy-quark interactions with the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the production and elliptic flow of (anti)nuclei in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.44 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19826</link>

Abstract: Measurements of (anti)deuteron and (anti)$^3$He production in the rapidity range $ |y| &lt; $ 0.5 as a function of the transverse momentum and event multiplicity in Xe$-$Xe collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon$-$nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.44 TeV are presented. The coalescence parameters $B_2$ and $B_3$ are measured as a function of the transverse momentum per nucleon. The ratios between (anti)deuteron and (anti)$^3$He yields and those of (anti)protons and pions are reported as a function of the mean charged-particle multiplicity density, and compared with two implementations of the statistical hadronization model and with coalescence predictions. The elliptic flow of (anti)deuterons is measured for the first time in Xe$-$Xe collisions and shows features similar to those already observed in Pb$-$Pb collisions, i.e., the mass ordering at low transverse momentum and the meson$-$baryon grouping at intermediate transverse momentum. The production of nuclei is particularly sensitive to the chemical freeze-out temperature of the system created in the collision, which is extracted from a grand-canonical-ensemble-based thermal fit, performed for the first time including light nuclei along with light-flavor hadrons in Xe$-$Xe collisions. The extracted chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\rm chem}$ = (154.2 $\pm$ 1.1) MeV in Xe$-$Xe collisions is similar to that observed in Pb$-$Pb collisions and close to the crossover temperature predicted by lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations.</description>

      <title>Measurement of beauty production via non-prompt charm hadrons in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production cross sections of $\mathrm {D^0}$, $\mathrm {D^+}$, and $\mathrm {\Lambda_{c}^{+}}$ hadrons originating from beauty-hadron decays (i.e. non-prompt) were measured for the first time at midrapidity in proton$-$lead (p$-$Pb) collisions at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV. Nuclear modification factors ($R_{\mathrm {pPb}}$) of non-prompt $\mathrm {D^0}$, $\mathrm {D^+}$, and $\mathrm {\Lambda_{c}^{+}}$ are calculated as a function of the transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm T}$) to investigate the modification of the momentum spectra measured in p$-$Pb collisions with respect to those measured in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at the same energy. The $R_{\mathrm {pPb}}$ measurements are compatible with unity and with the measurements in the prompt charm sector, and do not show a significant $p_{\mathrm T}$ dependence. The $p_{\mathrm T}$-integrated cross sections and $p_{\mathrm T}$-integrated $R_{\mathrm {pPb}}$ of non-prompt $\mathrm {D^0}$ and $\mathrm {D^+}$ mesons are also computed by extrapolating the visible cross sections down to $p_{\mathrm T}$ = 0. The non-prompt D-meson $R_{\mathrm {pPb}}$ integrated over $p_{\mathrm T}$ is compatible with unity and with model calculations implementing modification of the parton distribution functions of nucleons bound in nuclei with respect to free nucleons. The non-prompt $\mathrm {\Lambda_{c}^{+}/D^{0}}$ and $\mathrm{D^+/D^0}$ production ratios are computed to investigate hadronisation mechanisms of beauty quarks into mesons and baryons. The measured ratios as a function of $p_{\mathrm T}$ display a similar trend to that measured for charm hadrons in the same collision system.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of charged-particle intra-jet properties in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first measurement of the multiplicity dependence of intra-jet properties of leading charged-particle jets in proton-proton (pp) collisions is reported. The mean charged-particle multiplicity and jet fragmentation distributions are measured in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using the ALICE detector. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles produced in the midrapidity region ($|\eta|&lt;0.9$) using the sequential recombination anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with jet resolution parameters $R=0.2$, 0.3, and 0.4 for the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) interval 5-110 GeV/$c$. High-multiplicity events are selected by the forward V0 scintillator detectors. The mean charged-particle multiplicity inside the leading jet cone rises monotonically with increasing jet $p_{\rm T}$ in qualitative agreement with previous measurements at lower energies. The distributions of jet fragmentation function variables $z^{\rm ch}$ and $\xi^{\rm ch}$ are measured for different jet-$p_{\rm T}$ intervals. Jet-$p_{\rm T}$ independent fragmentation of leading jets is observed for wider jets except at high- and low-$z^{\rm ch}$. The observed hump-backed plateau structure in the $\xi^{\rm ch}$ distribution indicates suppression of low-$p_{\rm T}$ particles. In high-multiplicity events, an enhancement of the fragmentation probability of low-$z^{\rm ch}$ particles accompanied by a suppression of high-$z^{\rm ch}$ particles is observed compared to minimum-bias events. This behavior becomes more prominent for low-$p_{\rm T}$ jets with larger jet radius. The results are compared with predictions of QCD-inspired event generators, PYTHIA 8 with Monash 2013 tune and EPOS LHC. It is found that PYTHIA 8 qualitatively reproduces the jet modification in high-multiplicity events except at high jet $p_{\rm T}$. These measurements provide important constraints to models of jet fragmentation.</description>

      <title>A Nuclear Interferometer for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or clouds of atoms have the potential to complement advanced very-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons in the future. Nuclear interferometry may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to the QCD sector via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance existing and proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction of well-motivated parameter space.</description>

      <title>Role of octupole shape degree of freedom in neutron-rich odd-mass xenon isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Influences of the octupole shape degree of freedom on low-energy spectra of neutron-rich odd-mass xenon isotopes are studied within the interacting boson-fermion model that is based on the nuclear density functional theory. The interacting-boson Hamiltonian describing low-energy quadrupole and octupole collective states of the even-even nuclei $^{140,142,144}$Xe, single-particle energies, and occupation probabilities for an unpaired neutron in the odd-mass nuclei $^{141,143,145}$Xe, are determined based on the axially symmetric quadrupole-octupole deformation-constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations with a choice of the energy density functional and pairing interaction. Strength parameters of the boson-fermion interactions are empirically determined to reproduce a few low-lying levels of each odd-mass nucleus. The mean-field calculation predicts for $^{142}$Xe a potential energy surface that is notably soft in the octupole deformation with a non-zero octupole global minimum. The octupole correlations are shown to be relevant in positive-parity excited states of $^{143,145}$Xe.</description>
