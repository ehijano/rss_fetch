      <title>Escape cascades as a behavioral contagion process with adaptive network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex behavioral contagion in collective evasion of mobile animal groups can be predicted by reconstructing quantitative interaction networks. Based on the assumption of time-scale separation between a fast contagion process and a slower movement response, the underlying interaction networks have been previously assumed to be static, determined by the spatial structure at the onset of the collective escape response. This idealization does not account for the temporal evolution of the spatial network structure, which may have a major impact on the behavioral contagion dynamics. Here, we propose a spatially-explicit, agent-based model for the coupling between behavioral contagion and the network dynamics originating from the spreading movement response. We explore the impact of movement parameters (startle speed, initial directionality, and directional noise) on average cascade size. By conducting numerical simulations for different density levels, we show that increasing escape speed suppresses the cascade size in most cases, that the cascade size depends strongly on the movement direction of the initially startled individual, and that large variability in the direction of individual escape movements (rotational noise) will typically promote the spread of behavioral contagion through spatial groups. Our work highlights the importance of accounting for movement dynamics in behavioral contagion, and facilitates our understanding of rapid coordinated response and collective information processing in animal groups.</description>

      <title>Impact of directionality on the emergence of Turing patterns on m-directed higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We hereby develop the theory of Turing instability for reaction-diffusion systems defined on m-directed hypergraphs, the latter being generalization of hypergraphs where nodes forming hyperedges can be shared into two disjoint sets, the head nodes and the tail nodes. This framework encodes thus for a privileged direction for the reaction to occur: the joint action of tail nodes is a driver for the reaction involving head nodes. It thus results a natural generalization of directed networks. Based on a linear stability analysis we have shown the existence of two Laplace matrices, allowing to analytically prove that Turing patterns, stationary or wave-like, emerges for a much broader set of parameters in the m-directed setting. In particular directionality promotes Turing instability, otherwise absent in the symmetric case. Analytical results are compared to simulations performed by using the Brusselator model defined on a m-directed d-hyperring as well as on a m-directed random hypergraph.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Framework for Quantifying Emergent Effects in Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent effect is crucial to the understanding of the properties of complex systems that do not appear in their basic units, but there has been a lack of theories to measure and understand its mechanisms. In this paper, we established a framework based on homological algebra that encodes emergence as the mathematical structure of cohomologies and then applied it to network models to develop a computational measure of emergence. This framework ties the emergence of a system to its network topology and local structures, paving the way to predict and understand the cause of emergent effects. We show in our numerical experiment that our measure of emergence correlates with the existing information-theoretic measure of emergence.</description>
