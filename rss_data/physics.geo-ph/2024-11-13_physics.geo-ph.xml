      <title>Do Inner Greenland's Melt Rate Dynamics Approach Coastal Ones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Greenland Ice Sheet may be nearing a tipping point, transitioning to permanent melting. This article analyses two melt rate time series using the Bayesian Langevin estimation (BLE), providing further evidence for destabilizing melt dynamics, along with new insights from the method's nonlinear parameterisation. Comparing the results for Western Central Greenland and the Nuussuaq peninsula suggests that inland melt dynamics may approach less stable coastal dynamics on slow and fast scales. Both datasets show a significant increase in fast-scale amplitudes since the 1970s, possibly driven by large-scale atmospheric fluctuations. Additionally, the BLE's nonlinear drift proves crucial for obtaining these results, as a linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process fails to capture these dynamics due to the oversimplification of a strictly positive autocorrelation function.</description>

      <title>Realization of a clock-based global height system: A simulation study for Europe and South America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing efforts aim to achieve a globally uniform and consistent International Height Reference System (IHRS), as a global standard for accurately determining physical (height-)coordinates worldwide. Near the Earth's surface, two stationary standard clocks separated by 1 cm in height have a redshift of about 10^-18 according to Einstein's theory of general relativity. Thus, clock comparison allows for accurate height determination in high-performance clock networks. In such networks, frequency differences observed between clock sites and corresponding gravity potential differences can be derived. The heights can be represented as geopotential numbers and measured potential differences between clock locations in a dedicated clock network can be used to estimate the transformation parameters between regional/national height reference frames and resolve distortions in individual height systems. Our study employs chronometric levelling in closed-loop simulations across two different regions, Europe and Brazil. A set of realistic offsets and tilts in the local height data is assumed by considering, e.g., systematic tilts in latitude and longitude direction, errors related to the distance from the tide gauges, the elevation of levelling points, and the presence of noisy levelling lines. External effects such as tidal effects (solid earth tide, ocean load tide, pole tide), propagation errors due to fibre and space link uncertainties, random noise, and outliers are included in the simulation of the unification process. The best configuration is determined by analyzing the standard deviations of the estimated error parameters, which vary based on the spatial distribution of the clocks. An optimal setup includes placing clocks at corners, tide gauges, and the highest points of the local height systems. The added value of chronometric levelling is demonstrated for the realization of an IHRS.</description>

      <title>Librations and obliquity of the largest moons of Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the discovery of several ocean worlds in the solar system, and the selection of Uranus as the highest priority objective by the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032, the five largest moons of Uranus (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon) have been receiving renewed attention as they may also harbor a subsurface ocean. We assess how rotation measurements could help confirm the internal differentiation of the bodies and detect internal oceans if any. Because of the time-varying gravitational torque of Uranus on the flattened shape of its synchronous satellites, the latter librate with respect to their mean rotation and precess with a non zero obliquity. For a range of interior models with a rocky core surrounded by a hydrosphere, either solid or divided into an outer ice shell with a liquid ocean underneath, we compute their diurnal libration amplitude and obliquity.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of Geomechanical Deformation, Fluid Flow and Reactive Transport in Shale Rough-Walled Microfractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving hydrocarbon production with hydraulic fracturing from unconventional reservoirs requires investigating transport phenomena at the single fracture level. In this study, we simulated geomechanical deformation, fluid flow, and reactive transport to understand the effect of hydraulic fracturing treatment on permeability evolution in shale rough-walled fractures. Using concepts of fractional Brownian motion and surface roughness characterizations with laser profilometer, we first generated three rough-walled microfractures consistent with three laboratory experiments (i.e., E4, E5 and E6). After that, the generated microfractures were subjected to a confining pressure in accord with experimental conditions, and geomechanical deformation was simulated. We used the OpenFOAM software package to simulate the fluid flow and permeability. By comparing the simulated permeability values with the experimentally measured ones we found relative errors equal to 28, 15 and 200% respectively for the experiments E4, E5 and E6. After calibration, however, the relative error dropped below 4%. We next simulated the reactive transport using the GeoChemFOAM solver and investigated permeability evolution in the deformed microfractures. We found that after 10 hrs of reactive transport simulations, permeability increased by 47%, on average, in all cases studied here.</description>

      <title>Magnetic signals from oceanic tides: new satellite observations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal flow of seawater across the Earth's magnetic field induces electric currents and magnetic fields within the ocean and solid Earth. The amplitude and phase of the induced fields depends on electrical properties of both the seawater and the solid Earth, thus can be used as a proxy to study seabed properties or potentially for monitoring long-term trends in the global ocean climatology. This paper presents new global oceanic tidal magnetic field models and their uncertainties for four tidal constituents, including $M_2, N_2, O_1$ and $Q_1$, which was not reliably retrieved previously. Models are obtained through a robust least-squares analysis of magnetic field observations from the \textit{Swarm} and CHAMP satellites using a specially designed data selection scheme. We compare the retrieved magnetic signals with several alternative models reported in the literature. Additionally, we validate them using a series of high-resolution global 3-D electromagnetic simulations and place constraints on the conductivity of sub-oceanic mantle for all tidal constituents, revealing an excellent agreement between all tidal constituents and the oceanic upper mantle structure.</description>

      <title>Application of first- and second-order adjoint methods to glacial isostatic adjustment incorporating rotational feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits and extends the adjoint theory for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) of Crawford et al. (2018). Rotational feedbacks are now incorporated, and the application of the second-order adjoint method is described for the first time. The first-order adjoint method provides an efficient means for computing sensitivity kernels for a chosen objective functional, while the second-order adjoint method provides second-derivative information in the form of Hessian kernels. These latter kernels are required by efficient Newton-type optimisation schemes and within methods for quantifying uncertainty for non-linear inverse problems. Most importantly, the entire theory has been reformulated so as to simplify its implementation by others within the GIA community. In particular, the rate-formulation for the GIA forward problem introduced by Crawford et al. (2018) has been replaced with the conventional equations for modelling GIA in laterally heterogeneous earth models. The implementation of the first- and second-order adjoint problems should be relatively easy within both existing and new GIA codes, with only the inclusions of more general force terms being required.</description>

      <title>Information theory, Signal Analysis and Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book is intended for teaching Signal Analysis methods and Inverse Problems theory. It is completely open access and will remain free. It is currently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in geophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main idea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and throughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points need to be corrected in this English version. A French version is also available. The MATLAB codes we used can be found at the following address: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6tedk1xyquswmh0vcekfi/matlab_book.zip?rlkey=cbj5ura63qy6u57ij2yzgggkw&amp;st=8gp4gddd&amp;dl=0</description>

      <title>When Geoscience Meets Foundation Models: Towards General Geoscience Artificial Intelligence System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06799v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced Earth sciences, yet its full potential in to comprehensively modeling Earth's complex dynamics remains unrealized. Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</description>
