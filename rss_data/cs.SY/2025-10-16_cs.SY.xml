      <title>Control of dynamical systems with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control problems frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications, where the objective is to steer a dynamical system from an initial state to a desired target state. Recent advances in deep learning and automatic differentiation have made applying these methods to control problems increasingly practical. In this paper, we examine the use of neural networks and modern machine-learning libraries to parameterize control inputs across discrete-time and continuous-time systems, as well as deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We highlight applications in multiple domains, including biology, engineering, physics, and medicine. For continuous-time dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) offer a useful approach to parameterizing control inputs. For discrete-time systems, we show how custom control-input parameterizations can be implemented and optimized using automatic-differentiation methods. Overall, the methods presented provide practical solutions for control tasks that are computationally demanding or analytically intractable, making them valuable for complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent Load Profile Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion for LV Distribution Network Scenario Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional power distribution network planning and operations.</description>

      <title>ExaModelsPower.jl: A GPU-Compatible Modeling Library for Nonlinear Power System Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As GPU-accelerated mathematical programming techniques mature, there is growing interest in utilizing them to address the computational challenges of power system optimization. This paper introduces ExaModelsPower.jl, an open-source modeling library for creating GPU-compatible nonlinear AC optimal power flow models. Built on ExaModels.jl, ExaModelsPower.jl provides a high-level interface that automatically generates all necessary callback functions for GPU solvers. The library is designed for large-scale problem instances, which may include multiple time periods and security constraints. Using ExaModelsPower.jl, we benchmark GPU and CPU solvers on open-source test cases. Our results show that GPU solvers can deliver up to two orders of magnitude speedups compared to alternative tools on CPU for problems with more than 20,000 variables and a solution precision of up to $10^{-4}$, while performance for smaller instances or tighter tolerances may vary.</description>

      <title>A Wideband Composite Sequence Impedance Model for Evaluation of Interactions in Unbalanced Power-Electronic-Based Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a wideband composite sequence impedance model (WCSIM)-based analysis method to evaluate the interactions in power-electronic-based power systems subjected to unbalanced grid faults or with unbalanced loads. The WCSIM-based method intuitively assesses the impact of the small-signal interconnection among the positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence circuits on the interaction stability of unbalanced power systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using a permanent magnet synchronous generator-based weak grid system under a single-line-to-ground fault (SLGF). Frequency scanning results and controller hardware-in-loop tests validate both the correctness of the WCSIM and the effectiveness of the WCSIM-based analysis method.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Distribution Steering in Nonlinear Dynamics with Conjugate Unscented Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In highly nonlinear systems such as the ones commonly found in astrodynamics, Gaussian distributions generally evolve into non-Gaussian distributions. This paper introduces a method for effectively controlling non-Gaussian distributions in nonlinear environments using optimized linear feedback control. This paper utilizes Conjugate Unscented Transformation to quantify the higher-order statistical moments of non-Gaussian distributions. The formulation focuses on controlling and constraining the sigma points associated with the uncertainty quantification, which would thereby reflect the control of the entire distribution and constraints on the moments themselves. This paper develops an algorithm to solve this problem with sequential convex programming, and it is demonstrated through a two-body and three-body example. The examples show that individual moments can be directly controlled, and the moments are accurately approximated for non-Gaussian distributions throughout the controller's time horizon in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Profit and CO2 Mitigation: Commercial Direct Air Capture Design and Operation with Power Market Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current decarbonization efforts are falling short of meeting the net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emission target, highlighting the need for substantial carbon dioxide removal methods such as direct air capture (DAC). However, integrating DACs poses challenges due to their enormous power consumption. This study assesses the commercial operation of various DAC technologies that earn revenue using monetized carbon incentives while purchasing electricity from wholesale power markets. We model four commercial DAC technologies and examine their operation in three representative locations including California, Texas, and New York. Our findings reveal that commercial DAC operations can take financial advantage of the volatile power market to operate only during low-price periods strategically, offering a pathway to facilitate a cost-efficient decarbonization transition. The ambient operational environment such as temperature and relative humidity has non-trivial impact on abatement capacity. Profit-driven decisions introduce climate-economic trade-offs that might decrease the capacity factor of DAC and reduce total CO2 removal. These implications extend throughout the entire lifecycle of DAC developments and influence power systems and policies related to full-scale DAC implementation. Our study shows that DAC technologies with shorter cycle spans and higher flexibility can better exploit the electricity price volatility, while power markets demonstrate persistent low-price windows that often synergize with low grid emission periods, like during the solar "duck curve" in California. An optimal incentive design exists for profit-driven operations while carbon-tax policy in electricity pricing is counterproductive for DAC systems.</description>

      <title>Model predictive control lowers barriers to adoption of heat-pump water heaters: A field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric heat-pump water heaters (HPWHs) could reduce the energy costs, emissions, and power grid impacts associated with water heating, the second-largest energy use in United States housing. However, most HPWHs today require 240 V circuits to power the backup resistance heating elements they use to maintain comfort during large water draws. Installing a 240 V circuit can increase the up-front cost of a HPWH by half or more. This paper develops and field-tests the first control system that enables a 120 V HPWH to efficiently maintain comfort without resistance heating elements. The novel model predictive control (MPC) system enables pre-heating in anticipation of large water draws, which it forecasts using an ensemble of machine learning predictors. By shifting electrical load over time, MPC also reduces energy costs on average by 23% and 28% under time-of-use pricing and hourly pricing, respectively, relative to a 240 V HPWH with standard controls. Compared to the increasingly common practice in 120 V HPWHs of storing water at a constant, high temperature (60 {\deg}C) to ensure comfort, MPC saves 37% energy on average. In addition to demonstrating MPC's benefits in a real, occupied house, this paper discusses implementation challenges and costs. A simple payback analysis suggests that a 120 V HPWH, operated by the MPC system developed here, would be economically attractive in most installation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Competitive EV charging station location with queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) public charging infrastructure planning faces significant challenges in competitive markets, where multiple service providers affect congestion and user behavior. This work extends existing modeling frameworks by incorporating the presence of competitors' stations and more realistic queueing systems.
  First, we analyze three finite queueing systems, M/M/1/K, M/M/s/K, and M/Er/s/K, with varying numbers of servers (charging outlets) and service time distributions, deriving analytic expressions for user behavior metrics. Second, we embed the queueing-based user behavior model into a bilevel program, where the upper level locates new charging stations to maximize accessibility (throughput), and the lower level captures users' station choices via a user equilibrium. Third, we apply a reformulation from competitive congested user-choice facility location models to approximately solve the bilevel problem and introduce a surrogate-based heuristic to enhance scalability. Fourth, we showcase our methodology on a real-world case study of an urban area in Montreal (Canada), offering managerial insights into how user-choice behavior assumptions and competition affect throughput and location decisions. The results demonstrate that our model yields (re)location strategies that outperform the existing network. More broadly, this approach provides a tool for incorporating charging service quality-through queueing metrics-and existing competition into station planning.</description>

      <title>Identifying Best Candidates for Busbar Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising electricity demand and the growing integration of renewables are intensifying congestion in transmission grids. Grid topology optimization through busbar splitting (BuS) and optimal transmission switching can alleviate grid congestion and reduce the generation costs in a power system. However, BuS optimization requires a large number of binary variables, and analyzing all the substations for potential new topological actions is computationally intractable, particularly in large grids. To tackle this issue, we propose a set of metrics to identify and rank promising candidates for BuS, focusing on finding buses where topology optimization can reduce generation costs. To assess the effect of BuS on the identified buses, we use a combined mixed-integer convex-quadratic BuS model to compute the optimal topology and test it with the non-linear non-convex AC optimal power flow (OPF) simulation to show its AC feasibility. By testing and validating the proposed metrics on test cases of different sizes, we show that they are able to identify busbars that reduce the total generation costs when their topology is optimized. Thus, the metrics enable effective selection of busbars for BuS, with no need to test every busbar in the grid, one at a time.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Forced and Unforced Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking Under Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares the required fuel usage for forced and unforced motion of a chaser satellite engaged in Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking (RPOD) maneuvers. Improved RPOD models are vital, particularly as the space industry expands and demands for improved fuel efficiency, cost effectiveness, and mission life span increase. This paper specifically examines the Clohessy- Wiltshire (CW) Equations and the extent of model mismatch by comparing pre- dicted trajectories from this model with a more computationally complex, higher fidelity RPOD model. This paper assesses several test cases of similar mission parameters, in each case comparing natural motion circumnavigation (NMC) with comparable forced motion circumnavigation. The Guidance, Navigation, and Con- trol (GNC) impulse maneuvers required to maintain the supposedly zero fuel CW trajectories is representative of the extent of CW model mismatch. This paper demonstrates that unforced motions are not inherently more fuel efficient than forced motions, thus permitting extended orbital operations given the higher fuel efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data to Certificate: Guaranteed Cost Control with Quantization-Aware System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-assisted system identification and control have emerged as practical solutions for low-power, resource-constrained control systems such as micro-UAVs. In a typical cloud-assisted setting, state and input data are transmitted from local agents to a central computer over low-bandwidth wireless links, leading to quantization. This paper investigates the impact of state and input data quantization on a linear time invariant (LTI) system identification, derives a worst-case bound on the identification error, and develops a robust controller for guaranteed cost control. We establish a fundamental bound on the model error that depends only on the quantized data and quantization resolution, and develop a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based guaranteed cost robust controller under this error bound.</description>

      <title>Decision-dependent Robust Charging Infrastructure Planning for Light-duty Truck Electrification at Industrial Sites: Scheduling and Abandonment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many industrial sites rely on diesel-powered light-duty trucks to transport workers and small-scale facilities, which has resulted in a significant amount of greenhouse emissions (GHGs). To address this, we developed a two-stage robust charging infrastructure planning model for electrifying light-duty trucks at industrial sites. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) that optimizes the charging infrastructure, selected from multiple charger types and potential locations, and determines opportunity charging schedules for each truck based on the chosen infrastructure. Given the strict stopping points and schedules at industrial sites, we introduced a scheduling problem with abandonment, where trucks forgo charging if their waiting times exceed a maximum threshold. We also further incorporated the impacts of overnight charging and range anxiety on waiting and abandonment behaviors. To represent the stochastic and heterogeneous parking durations of trucks, we constructed a decision-dependent robust uncertainty set in which parking time variability flexibly depends on charging choices. We applied the model in a case study of an open-pit mining site, which plans charger installations in eight zones and schedules a fleet of around 200 trucks. By decomposing the problem into monthly subproblems and using heuristic approaches, for the whole-year dataset, the model achieves an optimality gap of less than 0.1 % within a reasonable computation time under diverse uncertainty scenarios.</description>

      <title>Safe Driving in Occluded Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe autonomous driving in the presence of occlusions poses a significant challenge in its policy design. While existing model-driven control techniques based on set invariance can handle visible risks, occlusions create latent risks in which safety-critical states are not observable. Data-driven techniques also struggle to handle latent risks because direct mappings from risk-critical objects in sensor inputs to safe actions cannot be learned without visible risk-critical objects. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic safety certificate for latent risk. Our key technical enabler is the application of probabilistic invariance: It relaxes the strict observability requirements imposed by set-invariance methods that demand the knowledge of risk-critical states. The proposed techniques provide linear action constraints that confine the latent risk probability within tolerance. Such constraints can be integrated into model predictive controllers or embedded in data-driven policies to mitigate latent risks. The proposed method is tested using the CARLA simulator and compared with a few existing techniques. The theoretical and empirical analysis jointly demonstrate that the proposed methods assure long-term safety in real-time control in occluded environments without being overly conservative and with transparency to exposed risks.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Scheduling for DAG Tasks Considering Probabilistic Execution Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems, critical for safety, require real-time guarantees and can be modeled as DAGs. Their acceleration features, such as caches and pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.</description>

      <title>Multipolar dynamics of social segregation: Data validation on Swedish vaccination statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a validation analysis on the multipolar model of opinion dynamics. A general methodology for using the model on datasets of two correlated variables is proposed and tested using data on the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates and political participation in Sweden. The model is shown to successfully capture the opinion segregation demonstrated by the data and spatial correlation of biases is demonstrated as necessary for the result. A mixing of the biases on the other hand leads to a more homogeneous opinion distribution, and greater penetration of the majority opinion, which here corresponds to a decision to vote or vaccinate.</description>

      <title>On the Flexibility Potential of a Swiss Distribution Grid: Opportunities and Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of distributed renewable generation and the electrification of heating and transportation are rapidly increasing the number of flexible devices within modern distribution grids. Leveraging the aggregated flexibility of these small-scale distributed resources is essential to maintaining future grid-wide stability. This work uses the Swiss distribution grid of Walenstadt as a case study to provide insights into the aggregated flexibility potential of distribution grids. It demonstrates that incorporating devices such as heat pumps and photovoltaic systems significantly enhances distribution grid flexibility. It investigates the time-varying nature of aggregated flexibility and highlights how it can vary seasonally. Furthermore, simulations of future scenarios reveal that aggregated flexibility does not increase linearly or monotonically with higher levels of flexible device penetration. This is primarily due to the overloading of individual feeders, which underscores the impact of grid topology and network constraints on the aggregated flexibility potential.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network Modeling of Vehicle Collision Dynamics in Precision Immobilization Technique Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of vehicle collision dynamics is crucial for advanced safety systems and post-impact control applications, yet existing methods face inherent trade-offs among computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and data requirements. This paper proposes a dual Physics-Informed Neural Network framework addressing these challenges through two complementary networks. The first network integrates Gaussian Mixture Models with PINN architecture to learn impact force distributions from finite element analysis data while enforcing momentum conservation and energy consistency constraints. The second network employs an adaptive PINN with dynamic constraint weighting to predict post-collision vehicle dynamics, featuring an adaptive physics guard layer that prevents unrealistic predictions whil e preserving data-driven learning capabilities. The framework incorporates uncertainty quantification through time-varying parameters and enables rapid adaptation via fine-tuning strategies. Validation demonstrates significant improvements: the impact force model achieves relative errors below 15.0% for force prediction on finite element analysis (FEA) datasets, while the vehicle dynamics model reduces average trajectory prediction error by 63.6% compared to traditional four-degree-of-freedom models in scaled vehicle experiments. The integrated system maintains millisecond-level computational efficiency suitable for real-time applications while providing probabilistic confidence bounds essential for safety-critical control. Comprehensive validation through FEA simulation, dynamic modeling, and scaled vehicle experiments confirms the framework's effectiveness for Precision Immobilization Technique scenarios and general collision dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of Missing Risk Markets for Decarbonized Power Systems with Long Duration Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a fully decarbonised electricity system depends on integrating new technologies that ensure reliability alongside sustainability. However, missing risk markets hinder investment in reliability-enhancing technologies by exposing investors to revenue uncertainty. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of how missing risk markets affect investment decisions in power systems that depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES) for reliability. We develop a two-stage stochastic equilibrium model with risk-averse market participants, which independently sizes power and energy capacity. We apply the method to a case study of a deeply decarbonised power system in Great Britain. The results show that incomplete risk markets reduce social welfare, harm reliability, and discourage investment in LDES and other technologies with volatile revenue streams. Revenue volatility leads to substantial risk premiums and higher financing costs for LDES, creating a barrier to its large-scale deployment. These findings demonstrate the importance of policy mechanisms that hedge revenue risk to lower the cost of capital and accelerate investment in reliability-enhancing, zero-carbon technologies</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation under Large Doppler Shifts in NOMA-Based Air-Ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a multiple antenna system with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for the exchange of air traffic management data between commercial aircraft pilots and ground-based air traffic controllers. While NOMA techniques enhance spectral efficiency, their application to aircraft communications is challenged by the high speed of the aircraft (up to 214 m/s) and the long communication ranges (up to 250 km), resulting in significant Doppler shifts and low signal-to-noise ratios, respectively. To accurately assess these challenges, we employ a realistic geometry-based stochastic air-ground channel model, derived from dedicated flight measurement campaigns. In this paper, multiple aircraft simultaneously transmit data to the ground station. We focus on the channel estimation problem at the ground station under high carrier frequency offsets and the effects of channel aging due to channel's time-varying nature. For the channel estimation problem, we compare the Zadoff-Chu sequences with time-division approach under varying carrier frequency offset pre-compensation accuracies at the aircraft transmitter. For the channel aging problem and performance evaluation of channel estimators, we compute the outage probability for both the zero-forcing detector and the minimum mean squared error detector with successive interference cancellation. The results show that the favorable channel estimator-detector combinations differ between the takeoff &amp; landing phase and the enroute cruise phase of the flight, due to the distinct channel propagation characteristics of each phase.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces as Control Barrier Functions for Safe Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface (safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin. Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated 7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.</description>

      <title>Information Shapes Koopman Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.</description>

      <title>Towards xApp Conflict Evaluation with Explainable Machine Learning and Causal Inference in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables a flexible, vendor-neutral deployment of 5G networks by disaggregating base station components and supporting third-party xApps for near real-time RAN control. However, the concurrent operation of multiple xApps can lead to conflicting control actions, which may cause network performance degradation. In this work, we propose a framework for xApp conflict management that combines explainable machine learning and causal inference to evaluate the causal relationships between RAN Control Parameters (RCPs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use model explainability tools such as SHAP to identify RCPs that jointly affect the same KPI, signaling potential conflicts, and represent these interactions as a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We then estimate the causal impact of each of these RCPs on their associated KPIs using metrics such as Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). This approach offers network operators guided insights into identifying conflicts and quantifying their impacts, enabling more informed and effective conflict resolution strategies across diverse xApp deployments.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step, an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights, which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparison of Gate-Based and Adiabatic Quantum Computing for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first direct comparison between gate-based quantum computing (GQC) and adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) for solving the AC power flow (PF) equations. Building on the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) algorithm originally designed for annealing platforms, we adapt it to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The PF equations are reformulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Numerical experiments on a 4-bus test system assess solution accuracy and computational time. Results from QAOA are benchmarked against those obtained using D-Wave's Advantage system and Fujitsu's latest generation Digital Annealer, i.e., Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The findings provide quantitative insights into the performance trade-offs, scalability, and practical viability of GQC versus AQC paradigms for PF analysis, highlighting the potential of quantum algorithms to address the computational challenges associated with modern electricity networks in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ).</description>

      <title>Data-driven learning of feedback maps for explicit robust predictive control: an approximation theoretic view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an algorithm to learn feedback maps from data for a class of robust model predictive control (MPC) problems. The algorithm accounts for the approximation errors due to the learning directly at the synthesis stage, ensuring recursive feasibility by construction. The optimal control problem consists of a linear noisy dynamical system, a quadratic stage and quadratic terminal costs as the objective, and convex constraints on the state, control, and disturbance sequences; the control minimizes and the disturbance maximizes the objective. We proceed via two steps -- (a) Data generation: First, we reformulate the given minmax problem into a convex semi-infinite program and employ recently developed tools to solve it in an exact fashion on grid points of the state space to generate (state, action) data. (b) Learning approximate feedback maps: We employ a couple of approximation schemes that furnish tight approximations within preassigned uniform error bounds on the admissible state space to learn the unknown feedback policy. The stability of the closed-loop system under the approximate feedback policies is also guaranteed under a standard set of hypotheses. Two benchmark numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Efficient Force and Stiffness Prediction in Robotic Produce Handling with a Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing. Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product. In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data, to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective distribution based on ripeness levels.</description>

      <title>Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first sufficient conditions that guarantee the stability and almost sure convergence of multi-timescale stochastic approximation (SA) iterates. It extends the existing results on one-timescale and two-timescale SA iterates to general $N$-timescale stochastic recursions, for any $N \geq 1$, using the ordinary differential equation (ODE) method. As an application, we study SA algorithms augmented with heavy-ball momentum in the context of Gradient Temporal Difference (GTD) learning. The added momentum introduces an auxiliary state evolving on an intermediate timescale, yielding a three-timescale recursion. We show that with appropriate momentum parameters, the scheme fits within our framework and converges almost surely to the same fixed point as baseline GTD. The stability and convergence of all iterates including the momentum state follow from our main results without ad hoc bounds. We then study off-policy actor-critic algorithms with a baseline learner, actor, and critic updated on separate timescales. In contrast to prior work, we eliminate projection steps from the actor update and instead use our framework to guarantee stability and almost sure convergence of all components. Finally, we extend the analysis to constrained policy optimization in the average reward setting, where the actor, critic, and dual variables evolve on three distinct timescales, and we verify that the resulting dynamics satisfy the conditions of our general theorem. These examples show how diverse reinforcement learning algorithms covering momentum acceleration, off-policy learning, and primal-dual methods-fit naturally into the proposed multi-timescale framework.</description>

      <title>Learning Power Flow with Confidence: A Probabilistic Guarantee Framework for Voltage Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of formal performance guarantees in machine learning (ML) has limited its adoption for safety-critical power system applications, where confidence and interpretability are as vital as accuracy. In this work, we present a probabilistic guarantee for power flow learning and voltage risk estimation, derived through the framework of Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Specifically, we establish a bound on the expected estimation error that connects the GP's predictive variance to confidence in voltage risk estimates, ensuring statistical equivalence with Monte Carlo-based ACPF risk quantification. To enhance model learnability in the low-data regime, we first design the Vertex-Degree Kernel (VDK), a topology-aware additive kernel that decomposes voltage-load interactions into local neighborhoods for efficient large-scale learning. Building on this, we introduce a network-swipe active learning (AL) algorithm that adaptively samples informative operating points and provides a principled stopping criterion without requiring out-of-sample validation. Together, these developments mitigate the principal bottleneck of ML-based power flow-its lack of guaranteed reliability-by combining data efficiency with analytical assurance. Empirical evaluations across IEEE 118-, 500-, and 1354-bus systems confirm that the proposed VDK-GP achieves mean absolute voltage errors below 1E-03 p.u., reproduces Monte Carlo-level voltage risk estimates with 15x fewer ACPF computations, and achieves over 120x reduction in evaluation time while conservatively bounding violation probabilities.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network-based Multi-timestep Command Governor for Nonlinear Systems with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-timestep command governor (MCG) is an add-on algorithm that enforces constraints by modifying, at each timestep, the reference command to a pre-stabilized control system. The MCG can be interpreted as a Model-Predictive Control scheme operating on the reference command. The implementation of MCG on nonlinear systems carries a heavy computational burden as it requires solving a nonlinear program with multiple decision variables at each timestep. This paper proposes a less computationally demanding alternative, based on approximating the MCG control law using a neural network (NN) trained on offline data. However, since the NN output may not always be constraint-admissible due to training errors, its output is adjusted using a sensitivity-based method. We thus refer to the resulting control strategy as the neural network-based MCG (NN-MCG). As validation, the proposed controller is applied as a load governor for constraint management in an automotive fuel cell system. It is shown that the proposed strategy is significantly more computationally efficient than the traditional MCG, while achieving nearly identical performance if the NN is well-trained.</description>

      <title>The Untapped Potential of Smart Charging: How EV Owners Can Save Money and Reduce Emissions Without Behavioral Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transportation sector is the single largest contributor to US emissions and the second largest globally. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to represent half of global car sales by 2035, emerging as a pivotal solution to reduce emissions and enhance grid flexibility. The electrification of buildings, manufacturing, and transportation is expected to grow electricity demand substantially over the next decade. Without effectively managed EV charging, EVs could strain energy grid infrastructure and increase electricity costs. Drawing on de-identified 2023 EV telematics data from Rivian Automotive, this study found that 72% of home charging commenced after the customer plugged in their vehicle regardless of utility time of use (TOU) tariffs or managed charging programs. In fewer than 26% of charging sessions in the sample, EV owners actively scheduled charging times to align or participate in utility tariffs or programs. With a majority of drivers concurrently plugged in during optimal charging periods yet not actively charging, the study identified an opportunity to reduce individual EV owner costs and carbon emissions through smarter charging habits without significant behavioral modifications or sacrifice in user preferences. By optimizing home charging schedules within existing plug-in and plug-out windows, the study suggests that EV owners can save an average of $140 annually and reduce the associated carbon emissions of charging their EV by as much as 28%.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for Voltage Regulation and Current Sharing in DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG. Each DG is equipped with a local controller for voltage regulation and a distributed global controller for current sharing, where the local controllers ensure individual voltage tracking while the global controllers coordinate among DGs to achieve proportional current sharing. To design the distributed global controllers, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions to enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based local controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a unified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication topology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated using existing convex optimization tools. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance with the droop control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids with ZIP Loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control and communication topology co-design approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (DC MGs) with generic ``ZIP'' (constant impedance (Z), current (I) and power (P)) loads. While ZIP loads accurately capture the varied nature of the consumer loads, its constant power load (CPL) component is particularly challenging (and destabilizing) due to its non-linear form. Moreover, ensuring simultaneous voltage regulation and current sharing and co-designing controllers and topology are also challenging when designing control solutions for DC MGs. To address these three challenges, we model the DC MG as a networked system comprised of distributed generators (DGs), ZIP loads, and lines interconnected according to a static interconnection matrix. Next, we equip each DG with a local controller and a distributed global controller (over an arbitrary topology) to derive the error dynamic model of the DC MG as a networked ``error'' system, including disturbance inputs and performance outputs. Subsequently, to co-design the controllers and the topology ensuring robust (dissipative) voltage regulation and current sharing performance, we use the dissipativity and sector boundedness properties of the involved subsystems and formulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems to be solved locally and globally. To support the feasibility of the global LMI problem, we identify and embed several crucial necessary conditions in the corresponding local LMI problems, thus providing a one-shot approach to solve the LMI problems. Overall, the proposed approach in this paper provides a unified framework for designing DC MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches.</description>

      <title>Design and benchmarking of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit for cable-driven wearable technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exosuits have recently been developed as alternatives to rigid exoskeletons and are increasingly adopted for both upper and lower limb therapy and assistance in clinical and home environments. Many cable-driven exosuits have been developed but little has been published on their electromechanical designs and performance. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive design and performance analysis of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit (TDU) for cable-driven wearable exosuits. Detailed methodologies are presented to benchmark the functionality of the TDU. A static torque output test compares the commanded and measured torques. A velocity control test evaluates the attenuation and phase shift across velocities. A noise test evaluates how loud the TDU is for the wearer under different speeds. A thermal stress test captures the cooling performance of the TDU to ensure safe operation at higher loads. Finally, a battery endurance test evaluates the runtime of the TDU under various loading conditions to inform the usable time. To demonstrate these tests, a modular TDU system for cable-driven applications is introduced, which allows components such as motors, pulleys, and sensors to be adapted based on the requirements of the intended application. By sharing detailed methodologies and performance results, this study aims to provide a TDU design that may be leveraged by others and resources for researchers and engineers to better document the capabilities of their TDU designs.</description>

      <title>On the Fast Nonlinear Filtering with Matrix Fisher Distributions on SO(3)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses two interrelated problems: the nonlinear filtering mechanism and fast attitude filtering with the matrix Fisher distribution (MFD) on the special orthogonal group. By analyzing the distribution evolution along Bayes' rule, we reveal two essential properties that enhance the performance of Bayesian attitude filters with MFDs, particularly in challenging conditions from a theoretical viewpoint. Benefiting from the new understanding of the filtering mechanism associated with MFDs, two closed-form filters with MFDs are then proposed. The filters avoids the burdensome computations in previous MFD-based filters by introducing linearized error systems with invariant errors but retaining the two advantageous properties.
  Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed filters are more accurate than the classic invariant Kalman filter. Besides, it is also as accurate as recent MFD-based Bayesian filters in challenging circumstances with large initial error and measurement uncertainty, but it consumes far less computation time (about 1/5 to 1/100 of previous MFD-based attitude filters).</description>

      <title>Addressing Model Inaccuracies in Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Diverse Alternatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing energy transition places significant pressure on the transmission network due to increasing shares of renewables and electrification. To mitigate grid congestion, transmission system operators need decision support tools to suggest remedial actions, such as transmission network reconfigurations or redispatch. However, these tools are prone to model inaccuracies and may not provide relevant suggestions with regard to important unmodeled constraints or operator preferences. We propose a human-in-the-loop modeling-to-generate alternatives (HITL-MGA) approach to address these shortcomings by generating diverse topology reconfiguration alternatives. Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the method can leverage expert feedback and improve the quality of the suggested topology reconfigurations.</description>

      <title>High-Parallel FPGA-Based Discrete Simulated Bifurcation for Large-Scale Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems exhibit exponential complexity, making their resolution challenging. Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements. A proof-of-concept implementation that solves 256-variable problems was achieved on an AMD Kria KV260 SoM, a low-tier FPGA, validated using well-known max-cut and knapsack problems.</description>

      <title>Convergence and sample complexity of natural policy gradient primal-dual methods for constrained MDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sequential decision making problem of maximizing the expected total reward while satisfying a constraint on the expected total utility. We employ the natural policy gradient method to solve the discounted infinite-horizon optimal control problem for Constrained Markov Decision Processes (constrained MDPs). Specifically, we propose a new Natural Policy Gradient Primal-Dual (NPG-PD) method that updates the primal variable via natural policy gradient ascent and the dual variable via projected subgradient descent. Although the underlying maximization involves a nonconcave objective function and a nonconvex constraint set, under the softmax policy parametrization, we prove that our method achieves global convergence with sublinear rates regarding both the optimality gap and the constraint violation. Such convergence is independent of the size of the state-action space, i.e., it is~dimension-free. Furthermore, for log-linear and general smooth policy parametrizations, we establish sublinear convergence rates up to a function approximation error caused by restricted policy parametrization. We also provide convergence and finite-sample complexity guarantees for two sample-based NPG-PD algorithms. We use a set of computational experiments to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tiny aerial robots hold great promise for applications such as environmental monitoring and search-and-rescue, yet face significant control challenges due to limited onboard computing power and nonlinear dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) enables agile trajectory tracking and constraint handling but depends on an accurate dynamics model. While existing Learning-Based (LB) MPC methods, such as Gaussian Process (GP) MPC, enhance performance by learning residual dynamics, their high computational cost restricts onboard deployment on tiny robots. This paper introduces Tiny LB MPC, a co-designed MPC framework and optimization solver for resource-constrained micro multirotor platforms. The proposed approach achieves 100 Hz control on a Crazyflie 2.1 equipped with a Teensy 4.0 microcontroller, demonstrating a 43% average improvement in tracking performance over existing embedded MPC methods under model uncertainty, and achieving the first onboard implementation of LB MPC on a 53 g multirotor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous virtual avatars (in extended reality) and robots in human group activities -- such as rehabilitation therapy, sports, and manufacturing -- is expected to increase as these technologies become more pervasive. Designing cognitive architectures and control strategies to drive these agents requires realistic models of human motion. Furthermore, recent research has shown that each person exhibits a unique velocity signature, highlighting how individual motor behaviors are both rich in variability and internally consistent. However, existing models only provide simplified descriptions of human motor behavior, hindering the development of effective cognitive architectures. In this work, we first show that motion amplitude provides a valid and complementary characterization of individual motor signatures. Then, we propose a fully data-driven approach, based on long short-term memory neural networks, to generate original motion that captures the unique features of specific individuals. We validate the architecture using real human data from participants performing spontaneous oscillatory motion. Extensive analyses show that state-of-the-art Kuramoto-like models fail to replicate individual motor signatures, whereas our model accurately reproduces the velocity distribution and amplitude envelopes of the individual it was trained on, while remaining distinct from others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots deployed in shared human environments, such as agricultural settings, require rigorous safety assurance to meet both functional reliability and regulatory compliance. These systems must operate in dynamic, unstructured environments, interact safely with humans, and respond effectively to a wide range of potential hazards. This paper presents a verification workflow for the safety assurance of an autonomous agricultural robot, covering the entire development life-cycle, from concept study and design to runtime verification. The outlined methodology begins with a systematic hazard analysis and risk assessment to identify potential risks and derive corresponding safety requirements. A formal model of the safety controller is then developed to capture its behaviour and verify that the controller satisfies the specified safety properties with respect to these requirements. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a field robot operating in an agricultural setting. The results show that the methodology can be effectively used to verify safety-critical properties and facilitate the early identification of design issues, contributing to the development of safer robots and autonomous systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive closed-form extensions of Riccati's recursions (both sequential and parallel) for solving dual-regularized LQR problems. We show how these methods can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We provide MIT-licensed implementations of our methods in C++ and JAX.</description>

      <title>Geometric Backstepping Control of Omnidirectional Tiltrotors Incorporating Servo-Rotor Dynamics for Robustness against Sudden Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric backstepping controller for a variable-tilt omnidirectional multirotor that explicitly accounts for both servo and rotor dynamics. Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and reliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery from sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware control for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on linear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture the nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit the cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its nonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and establish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal parametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we demonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such uncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not account for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast translational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden disturbance. The proposed method consistently achieved better tracking performance, and notably, while the baseline diverged and crashed during the fastest translational trajectory tracking and the recovery experiment, the proposed controller maintained stability and successfully completed the tasks, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Product Digital Twin Supporting End-of-life Phase of Electric Vehicle Batteries Utilizing Product-Process-Resource Asset Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However, manufacturers frequently do not support these processes enough in terms of not sharing relevant data about the products nor their (re-)manufacturing processes. This paper proposes to accompany each product with a digital twin technology, specifically the Product Digital Twin (PDT), which can carry information for facilitating and optimizing production and remanufacturing processes. This paper introduces a knowledge representation called Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (Bi-PAN). Bi-PAN extends a well-proven Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (PAN) paradigm by integrating both assembly and disassembly workflows into a single information model. Such networks enable capturing relevant relationships across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a product. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a use-case of disassembling electric vehicle (EV) batteries. By utilizing PDTs with Bi-PAN knowledge models, challenges associated with disassembling of EV batteries can be solved flexibly and efficiently for various battery types, enhancing the sustainability of the EV battery life-cycle management.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Terrain-Aware Path Planning: Integrating VD-RRT* Exploration and VD-D* Lite Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties. The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner, the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>The value of storage in electricity distribution: The role of markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electricity distribution companies deploy battery storage to defer grid upgrades by reducing peak demand. In deregulated jurisdictions, such storage often sits idle because regulatory constraints bar participation in electricity markets. Here, we develop an optimization framework that, to our knowledge, provides the first formal model of market participation constraints within storage investment and operation planning. Applying the framework to a Massachusetts case study, we find that market participation could deliver similar savings as peak demand reduction. Under current conditions, market participation does not increase storage investment, but at very low storage costs, could incentivize deployment beyond local distribution needs. This might run contrary to the separation of distribution from generation in deregulated markets. Our framework can identify investment levels appropriate for local distribution needs.</description>
