      <title>One-dimensional Plasmons and Hybridized Coupled Polaritons in Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) ab-initio simulations of selected armchair carbon nanotubes (CNTs). By scaling the lengths of CNTs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the Tomonaga-Luttinger (T-L) 1-D plasmon velocities, confirming consistency with theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Our findings include detailed visual representations of excitation densities at various resonances. Furthermore, we explore the coupling between T-L plasmons and single electron excitations, identifying distinct 1-D polariton behaviors, such as strong harmonic generation due to nonlinearities, as well as energy gaps that differ from conventional 2-D polaritons. The study highlights the unique properties of armchair SWCNTs as low-loss nanocavity resonators, demonstrating potential applications in strong light-matter coupling and other nanophotonic devices. The simulation framework employed here opens avenues for further research into 1-D plasmonic phenomena and electronic spectroscopy in complex nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude/phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature thermoelectric transport in the disordered two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction corrections to the thermoelectric transport coefficient $\alpha$ and the thermopower $S$ in the two-dimensional disordered electron gas with long-range Coulomb interactions. To this end, we analyze the heat density-density correlation function using the recently derived generalized non-linear sigma model with particle-hole asymmetry. We present a detailed account of the perturbative calculation of the correlation function, the analysis of its structure, and the derivation of the final results for the transport coefficients. We show that both real and virtual processes give rise to logarithmic interaction corrections to $\alpha$ and $S$ with $\delta \alpha/\alpha&lt;0$ and $\delta S/S&lt;0$ in the diffusive transport regime $T\ll 1/\tau$, where $T$ is the temperature and $1/\tau$ is the disorder scattering rate. A short account of our findings is presented in an accompanying letter.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallicity in Triangulene-based Superatomic Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets has opened up new possibilities for miniaturizing spintronic devices to the monolayer limit. 2D half-metals, capable of conducting fully spin-polarized currents when spin-orbit coupling is minimal, provide a key advantage in improving device performance. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out to discover 2D half-metals, yet their realization remains elusive. Here we report the bottom-up synthesis of superatomic graphene and the demonstration of its half-metallic properties. The produced graphene half-metal is fabricated through an on-surface synthetic approach with phosphorus-doped triangulene as its building block. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal its metallic band structures and identify its ferromagnetism through magnon excitation under varying magnetic fields. Density functional theory simulations accurately capture its half-metallic characteristics, uncovering the origin of spin-polarized bands from the p$_x,_y$-like orbital of superatomic graphene. Our work demonstrates intrinsic 2D carbon magnetism, paving the way for harnessing its advantages in spintronics.</description>

      <title>The electronic and optical properties of graphene nanoribbons under the influence of the periodic strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of graphene nanoribbons under uniaxial periodic strain have been explored using various nearest-neighbor hopping patterns. It is found that by properly selecting hopping patterns, momentum-resolved gaps within minibands emerge, modifying the energy band structure to exhibit hollowed-out profiles, and enhancing peak intensity in local density of states but reducing peak count. The optical transitions are impacted by altered parity symmetry of wavefunctions, causing changes in optical selection rules. The parity of wavefunctions for strained GNRs has been established through rigorous mathematical proof, whereby the optical selection rule is determined for the strained GNRs. The absorption curves arise from a complex interplay between diminished velocity matrix elements and escalated joint density of states.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of charge transport and thermoelectric response in disordered 2D electron systems: From weak to strong localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new theoretical scheme for charge transport and thermoelectric response in two-dimensional disordered systems exhibiting crossover from weak localization (WL) to strong localization (SL). The scheme is based on the scaling theory for Anderson localization combined with the Kubo-Luttinger theory. Key aspects of the scheme include introducing a unified $\beta$ function that seamlessly connects the WL and SL regimes, as well as describing the temperature ($T$) dependence of the conductance from high to low $T$ regions on the basis of the dephasing length. We found that the Seebeck coefficient, $S$, behaves as $S\propto T$ in the WL limit and as $S\propto T^{1-p}$ ($p &lt; 1$) in the SL limit, both with possible logarithmic corrections. The scheme is applied to analyze experimental data for thin films of the p-type organic semiconductor poly[2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno(3,2-b)thiophene] (PBTTT).</description>

      <title>Electron g-factor of strained Ge caused by the SiGe substrate and its dependence on growth directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For photon-spin conversion, the Ge hole system in a strained GeSi/Ge quantum well with a diamond structure has attracted significant attention because of the potential for a high-performance spin qubit and optical transitions ranging in telecom bands. We calculated the electron g-factor for strained Ge, analyzing its dependence on both the growth directions ([100], [110], and [111]) and the Ge content of the SiGe substrate using an 8-band model. Our results indicate that the absolute values of the electron g-factor decrease with decreasing Ge content, ranging from approximately -3.0 to -1.4 for all growth directions.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal and transverse mobilities of $n$-type monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the presence of proximity-induced interactions at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical investigation on the electronic transport properties of $n$-type monolayer (ML) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at low temperature in the presence of proximity-induced interactions such as Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and the exchange interaction. The electronic band structure is calculated by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian, and the electric screening induced by electron-electron interaction is evaluated under a standard random phase approximation approach. In particular, the longitudinal and transverse or Hall mobilities are calculated by using a momentum-balance equation derived from a semi-classical Boltzmann equation, where the electron-impurity interaction is considered as the principal scattering center at low temperature. The obtained results show that the RSOC can induce the in-plane spin components for spin-split subbands in different valleys, while the exchange interaction can lift the energy degeneracy for electrons in different valleys. The opposite signs of Berry curvatures in the two valleys would introduce opposite directions of Lorentz force on valley electrons. As a result, the transverse currents from nondegenerate valleys can no longer be canceled out so that the transverse current or Hall mobility can be observed. Interestingly, we find that at a fixed effective Zeeman field, the lowest spin-split conduction subband in ML-TMDs can be tuned from one in the $K'$-valley to one in the $K$-valley by varying the Rashba parameter. The occupation of electrons in different valleys also varies with changing carrier density. Therefore, we can change the magnitude and direction of the Hall current by varying the Rashba parameter, effective Zeeman field, and carrier density by, e.g., the presence of a ferromagnetic substrate and/or applying a gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical conductivity of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in the presence of proximity-induced exchange interaction and external electrical field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the magneto-optical (MO) properties of monolayer (ML) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the presence of external electrical and quantizing magnetic fields and of the proximity-induced exchange interaction. The corresponding Landau Level (LL) structure is studied by solving the Schr\"odinger equation and the spin polarization in ML-TMDs under the action of the magnetic field is evaluated.The impact of trigonal warping on LLs and MO absorption is examined. Furthermore, the longitudinal MO conductivity is calculated through the dynamical dielectric function under the standard random-phase approximation (RPA) with the Kubo formula. We take ML-MoS$_2$ as an example to examine the effects of proximity-induced exchange interaction, external electrical and magnetic fields on the MO conductivity induced via intra- and interband electronic transitions among the LLs. For intraband electronic transitions within the conduction or valence bands, we can observe two absorption peaks in terahertz (THz) frequency range. While the interband electronic transitions between conduction and valence LLs show a series of absorption peaks in the visible range. We find that the proximity-induced exchange interaction, the carrier density, the strengths of the external electrical and magnetic fields can effectively modulate the positions of the absorption peaks and the shapes of the MO absorption spectra. The results obtained from this study can benefit to an in-depth understanding of the MO properties of ML-TMDs which can be potentially applied for magneto-optic, spintronic and valleytronic devices working in visible to THz frequency bandwidths.</description>

      <title>Full tomography of topological Andreev bands in graphene Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiply connected electronic networks threaded by flux tubes have been proposed as a platform for adiabatic quantum transport and topological states. Multi-terminal Josephson junction (MTJJ) has been suggested as a pathway to realize this concept. Yet, the manifestations of topology in MTJJ remain open for experimental study. Here, we investigated the artificial topological band structure of three-terminal graphene Josephson junctions. Employing tunnelling spectroscopy and magnetic flux gates, we captured the tomography of the Andreev bound state (ABS) energy spectrum as a function of two independent phase differences. This ABS spectrum exhibits the topological transition from gapped to gapless states, akin to the band structure of nodal-line semimetals. Our results show the potential of graphene-based MTJJs for engineering band topologies in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unified strategy of flat band engineering, electronic transport and other spectral properties for different kagome ribbon variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of flat band engineering in different prototypes of quasi-one dimensional kagome network through a generalized analytical proposition worked out within the tight-binding formalism. Exact fabrication of single particle eigenstates with localized as well as diffusive modes is reported through the demonstration of such unified methodology by virtue of a simple real space decimation formalism in such interesting variants of ribbon shaped geometry. The description provides a common platform to investigate the band dispersion including the overall spectral portrait and associated physical aspects of those quasi-one dimensional lattices. Exact detection of dispersionless flat band mode and its tunability are reported as a direct consequence of the analytical prescription. Analytical work out is justified through the numerical evaluation of density of eigenstates, electronic transmission behavior, inverse participation ratio, persistent current study, Aharanov-Bohm oscillation in the transmittance and other related issues. An obvious analogous extension in the context photonics concludes our description.</description>

      <title>Ordered states in AB bilayer graphene in SU(4)-symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply SU(4)-symmetric model to examine possible ordered states in AB stacked bilayer graphene (AB-BLG). The Hamiltonian of the system possesses this symmetry under certain assumptions. In such a model the multicomponent order parameter can be presented as a $4\times4$ matrix $\hat{Q}$. Using a mean field approximation, we derive a self-consistency equation for $\hat{Q}$. Among possible solutions of the obtained equation there are anomalous quantum Hall states, spin, charge, isospin (or valley) density waves, inter-layer excitonic phases and their combinations. We argue that the proposed approach is a useful tool for classification of the ordered states in AB-BLG. The ordered states of the SU(4)-symmetric model demonstrate extensive degeneracies. They can be removed by taking into account the neglected terms, doping, disorder, substrate, as well as other perturbations. The ordered states have varying sensitivity to these factors. This suggests that, for AB-BLG, a ground state ordering type is a non-universal property, susceptible to particulars of extrinsic conditions.</description>

      <title>Electrical Interconnects for Silicon Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable spin qubit devices will likely require long-range qubit interconnects. We propose to create such an interconnect with a resistive topgate. The topgate is positively biased, to form a channel between the two dots; an end-to-end voltage difference across the nanowire results in an electric field that propels the electron from source dot to target dot. The electron is momentum-incoherent, but not necessarily spin-incoherent; we evaluate threats to spin coherence due to spin-orbit coupling, valley physics, and nuclear spin impurities. We find that spin-orbit coupling is the dominant threat, but momentum-space motional narrowing due to frequent scattering partially protects the electron, resulting in characteristic decoherence lengths ~15 mm for plausible parameters.</description>

      <title>Persistent current distributions along a p-n junction in graphene in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A p-n junction, induced in graphene by gating, works to contrast the edge states of electrons and holes on each side of it. In a magnetic field those edge states carry two species of persistent current, which are intimately tied to the edge-mode spectra. We study how those persistent currents change along each side of the junction as the Fermi level is varied, with special emphasis on the electron-hole conjugation property of the Dirac electrons. A close look is made into the electromagnetic response of the valence band filled with negative-energy electrons, or the Dirac sea, which as a whole turns out to be electrically inactive while showing intrinsic orbital diamagnetism. Recently, in experiment, it became possible to observe local currents in planar samples by use of a nanoscale magnetometer. The p-n junctions in graphene and related atomic layers, via detection of associated microscopic currents, will be a useful platform for exploring many-body quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Formation mechanisms and fluorescence properties of carbon dots in coal burning dust from coal fired power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) shows great application potential with their unique and excellent performances. Coal and its derivatives are rich in aromatic ring structure, which is suitable for preparing CDs in microstructure. Coal burning dust from coal-fired power plants can be utilized as a rich resource to separate and extract CDs. It has been shown in our results that there have two main possible mechanisms for the formation of CDs in coal burning dust. One is the self-assembly of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contained in coal or produced by incomplete combustion of coal. The other mechanism is that the bridge bonds linking different aromatic structures in coal are breaking which would form CDs with different functional groups when the coals are burning at high temperature. Under violet light excitation at 310-340 nm or red light at 610-640 nm, CDs extracted from coal burning dust can emit purple fluorescence around 410 nm. The mechanism of up-conversion fluorescence emission of CDs is due to a two-photon absorption process. The recycling of CDs from coal burning dust from coal-fired power plants are not only good to protect environment but also would be helpful for mass production of CDs.</description>

      <title>The Mechanical Behavior of Macroscale Single-crystal Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive microscale studies, the macroscopic mechanical properties of monolayer graphene remain underexplored. Here, we report the Young's modulus ($E$ = 1.11 $\pm$ 0.04 TPa), tensile strength (${\sigma}$ = 27.40 $\pm$ 4.36 GPa), and failure strain (${\epsilon}_f$ = 6.01 $\pm$ 0.92 %) of centimeter-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene (SCG) 'dog bone' samples with edges aligned along the zigzag (zz) direction, supported by an ultra-thin polymer (polycarbonate) film. For samples with edges along the armchair (ac) direction, we obtain $E$ = 1.01 $\pm$ 0.10 TPa, ${\sigma}$ = 20.21 $\pm$ 3.22 GPa, ${\epsilon}_f$ = 3.69 $\pm$ 0.38 %, and for chiral samples whose edges were between zz and ac, we obtain $E$= 0.75 $\pm$ 0.12 TPa, ${\sigma}$ = 23.56 $\pm$ 3.42 GPa, and ${\epsilon}_f$ = 4.53 $\pm$ 0.40 %. The SCG is grown on single crystal Cu(111) foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We used a home-built 'float-on-water' (FOW) tensile testing system for tensile loading measurements that also enabled in situ crack observation. The quantized fracture mechanics (QFM) analysis predicts an edge defect size from several to tens of nanometers based on chirality and notch angle. Through Weibull analysis and given that the fatal defects are confined on the edges of macroscale samples, we projected strength ranging from 13.67 to 18.43 GPa for an A4-size SCG according to their chirality. The exceptional mechanical performance of macroscale single crystal graphene (SCG) paves the way for its widespread use in a very wide variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Topological Energy levels of Finite Graphene Nanoribbons Tuned by Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we conduct a theoretical investigation into the Stark shift of topological states (TSs) in finite armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) and heterostructures under transverse electric fields. Our focus centers on the multiple end zigzag edge states of AGNRs and the interface states of $9-7-9$ AGNR heterostructures. For the formal TSs, we observe a distinctive blue Stark shift in energy levels relative to the electric field within a range where the energy levels of TSs do not merge into the energy levels of bulk states. Conversely, for the latter TSs, we identify an oscillatory Stark shift in energy levels around the Fermi level. Simultaneously, we reveal the impact of the Stark effect on the transmission coefficients for both types of TSs. Notably, we uncover intriguing spectra in the multiple end zigzag edge states. In the case of finite $9-7-9$ AGNR heterostructures, the spectra of transmission coefficient reveal that the coupling strength between the topological interface states can be well controlled by the transverse electric fields. The outcomes of this research not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the electronic property in graphene-based materials but also pave the way for innovations in next-generation electronic devices and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Phosphorene Junctions as a Platform for Spin-Selective Quantum Dots in Next-Generation Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of vacancies on spin-resolved electronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) in phosphorene-based junctions, are investigated numerically. Regardless of the crystal orientation, a phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) containing a monovacancy is found to exhibit a topological quasi-flat band that emerges within the band gap. The electronic properties of QDs, including spatial confinement and energy level distribution, can be strongly tuned by controlling the topological structure of the QDs and by applying electric fields. Additionally, these QDs exhibit remarkable spin-selective properties under a ferromagnetic exchange field, enabling the manipulation of QD features. This opens up the potential for novel applications such as quantum computing, magnetic sensing, spin-based light emission.</description>

      <title>Curvature of Energy Dispersions in Condensed Matter Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene, a two-dimensional material with tunable electronic properties, holds significant importance in condensed matter physics and material science. In this study, we analyze the curvature of graphene's ground-state energy dispersion band by examining its Gaussian and mean curvature under varying on-site potential values, M, using graphene's Hamiltonian under periodic boundary conditions. We diagonalized the Hamiltonian matrix to obtain eigenvalues on a discretized grid for the Brillouin zone in momentum space, constructing the ground-state energy dispersion band. Surface differentials are then calculated to subsequently calculate Gaussian and mean curvature at each point in the grid using the definitions of the first and second fundamental forms. These values were collated to form curvature plots, and we plotted the logarithm of maximum Gaussian and mean curvature values from each plot against the corresponding values of the logarithm of M. After analyzing these plots, we observe that both the Gaussian and mean curvature remain approximately the same until the on-site potential is equal to or greater than the nearest-neighbor hopping parameter of the graphene Hamiltonian, at which point they begin to decline. Therefore, this study offers insights into studying the graphene Hamiltonian further and shows that studying the mean and Gaussian curvature of energy dispersions can prove to be a viable method of studying quantum systems. Further directions may include topological studies of other Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Capping layer dependent anti-correlation between magnetic damping and spin-orbital to charge conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic Gilbert damping and spin-orbital to charge interconversion phenomenon play vital role in controlling the modern spintronics device performances. Though the ferromagnets (FMs) and heavy metals (HMs) are considered to be the key components of the future spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) devices, recently the integration of lighter materials with low intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in spintronics devices has proven to be noteworthy. Here we demonstrate the efficient control of magnetization dynamics of $\beta$-W/CoFeB bilayer when capped by low SOC organic and inorganic layers. The C$_{60}$ capping layer (CL) significantly enhances the magnetization relaxation process compared to the CuO$_x$ in $\beta$-W/CoFeB/CL heterostructures, while the static magnetic properties remain in-different irrespective of the nature of CL. Interestingly, the spin-orbital to charge conversion phenomenon is found to be enhanced for $\beta$-W/CoFeB/CuO$_x$ stacking compared to the $\beta$-W/CoFeB/C$_{60}$ heterostructure, signifying the anti-correlation between the magnetic damping and spin-orbital to charge conversion. The results are interpreted by the interfacial phenomena, like the orbital Rashba effect, two-magnon scattering, and interfacial spin memory loss. Our detailed experimental investigations shed light on the importance of low SOC materials in effectively tuning the magnetization dynamics for the development of future power efficient spintronics devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule junctions - nanoscale systems where a molecule is connected to metallic electrodes - offer a unique platform for studying charge, spin and energy transport in non-equilibrium many-body quantum systems, with few parallels in other areas of condensed matter physics. Over the past decades, these systems have revealed a wide range of remarkable quantum phenomena, including quantum interference, non-equilibrium spin-crossover, diode-like behavior, or chiral-induced spin selectivity, among many others. To develop a detailed understanding, it turned out essential to have available ab initio-based tools for accurately describing quantum transport in such systems. They need to be capable of capturing the intricate electronic structure of molecules, sometimes in the presence of electron-electron or electron-phonon interactions, in out-of-equilibrium environments. Such tools are indispensable also for experimentally observed phenomena explained in terms of parametrized tight-binding models for the quantum transport problem. While FHI-aims also offers specialized transport routines, e.g. for chemically functionalized nanotubes or nanotube networks, our focus in this section is on the AITRANSS package designed for simulations of single-molecule transport. AITRANSS is an independent post-processing tool that combined with FHI-aims enables the calculation of electronic transport properties, as well as atom-projected density of states, spin properties and the simulation of scanning tunneling microscope images in molecular junctions. Pilot versions of the code extend some of these capabilities to non-linear transport in the applied bias, with plans to include these features in future releases of the package.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Electrostatic Patch Force Evaluation on the Lateral Resolution of Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) is widely used to measure the surface potential on samples, from which electrostatic patch force can be calculated. However, since the KPFM measurements represent a weighted average of local potentials on the sample, the accuracy of the evaluation critically depends on the precision and lateral resolution of the method. In this paper, we investigate the influence of this averaging effect on patch force estimations using both analytic and numerical methods. First, we derive the correlation functions of patch potential and establish the formulas for calculating the electrostatic patch forces in the parallel-plate geometry, with and without consideration of the KPFM measurement effect. Thus, an analytic method is established to determine the accuracy of patch force evaluation when the statistical parameters of the patch potential and the lateral resolution of the KPFM are given. Second, numerical simulations are employed to explore the dependence of estimated patch forces on the KPFM's lateral resolution under more realistic conditions. Both analytic and numerical results show a similar dependence of the patch force estimation on the patch characteristic size, potential fluctuation and the lateral resolution of the KPFM. It is also found that the underestimation of the patch force becomes less sensitive to the KPFM's resolution as the separation between plates increases. The results of this study could provide useful guidance for the accurate evaluation of electrostatic patch forces using KPFM.</description>

      <title>Cancellation theorem breaking and resonant spin-tensor Hall conductivity in higher-rank spin-tensor Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advances in simulating quantum phenomena in cold atoms, the higher-rank spin tensor Hall effect was discovered in larger spin systems with spin-tensor-momentum coupling, which is an extension of the celebrated spin Hall effects in larger spins. Previously, it has been proposed that a 2D electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling can generate dissipationless transverse spin current, namely the spin Hall effect. However, later work showed that the spin current is canceled by vertex correction, which was subsequently proven by a cancellation theorem that does not depend on any assumptions related to the scattering mechanism, the strength of spin-orbit coupling, or the Fermi energy. While the recent proposal demonstrates a universal intrinsic spin-tensor Hall conductivity, it is unclear if it vanishes similarly to the spin Hall effect. In this work, we address this critical problem and show that the rank-2 spin-tensor current can be divergent by considering the contributions of both interbranch and intrabranch transitions, which resembles the quantum Hall effect in some sense. So the \textit{universal} spin-tensor Hall effect can not be observed in a system with finite size. However, we further show that there is an \textit{observable non-zero} resonance of spin-tensor Hall conductivity as the Landau levels cross under the magnetic field. Our work reveals interesting conductivity properties of larger-spin systems and will provide valuable guidance for experimental explorations of higher-rank spin-tensor Hall effects, as well as their potential device applications.</description>

      <title>Chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigated the chiral phonons of honeycomb-type bilayer Wigner crystals recently discovered in van der Waals structures of layered transition metal dichalcogenides. These chiral phonons can emerge under the inversion symmetry breaking introduced by an effective mass imbalance between the two layers or a moir\'e potential in one layer, as well as under the time-reversal symmetry breaking realized by applying a magnetic field. Considering the wide tunability of layered materials, the frequencies and chirality values of phonons can both be tuned by varying the system parameters. These findings suggest that bilayer honeycomb-type Wigner crystals can serve as an exciting new platform for studying chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Bright dipolar excitons in twisted black phosphorus homostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright dipolar excitons, which contain electrical dipoles and have high oscillator strength, are an ideal platform for studying correlated quantum phenomena. They usually rely on carrier tunneling between two quantum wells or two layers to hybridize with nondipolar excitons to gain oscillator strength. In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90{\deg}-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.</description>

      <title>Rydberg series of intralayer K-excitons in WSe$_2$ multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides of group VI are well-known for their prominent excitonic effects and the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap when reduced to monolayers. While considerable efforts have elucidated the Rydberg series of excitons in monolayers, understanding their properties in multilayers remains incomplete. In these structures, despite an indirect band gap, momentum-direct excitons largely shape the optical response. In this work, we combine magneto-reflectance experiments with theoretical modeling based on the $\mathbf {k\cdot p}$ approach to investigate the origin of excitonic resonances in WSe$_2$ bi-, tri-, and quadlayers. For all investigated thicknesses, we observe a series of excitonic resonances in the reflectance spectra, initiated by a ground state with an amplitude comparable to the ground state of the 1$s$ exciton in the monolayer. Higher energy states exhibit a decrease in intensity with increasing energy, as expected for the excited states of the Rydberg series, although a significant increase in the diamagnetic shift is missing in tri- and quadlayers. By comparing the experimental observations with theoretical predictions, we discover that the excitonic resonances observed in trilayers originate from two Rydberg series, while quadlayers exhibit four such series, and bilayers host a single Rydberg series similar to that found in monolayers.</description>

      <title>Diverging entanglement of critical magnons in easy-axis antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the instability of antiferromagnets with easy-axis anisotropy under a magnetic field, uncovering single or even multiple phase transitions at the boundary between non-collinear and collinear spin orderings. Near the phase boundary, the entanglement between the sublattice magnons diverges due to the interplay among antiferromagnetic exchange interaction, anisotropy, and magnetic field. Furthermore, our study reveals that this magnetic criticality extends to a superradiant phase transition within cavity magnonics systems. The magnon-photon interaction results in diverging cavity photon numbers and squeezing in the ground state at the transition points between spin orderings. This investigation not only elucidates the criticality of multi-component squeezed magnons in antiferromagnets, but also proposes cavity photon measurements as a viable method for detecting magnetic phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Gatemon qubit on a germanium quantum-well heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gatemons are superconducting qubits similar to transmons except that the Josephson element consists of a gate-tunable semiconducting weak link. Here, we report the realization of a gatemon device obtained by fabricating a microwave circuit in aluminium on a SiGe heterostructure embedding a Ge quantum well. Owing to the superconducting proximity effect, the high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas confined in this well provides a gate-tunable superconducting weak link between two Al contacts. We perform Rabi oscillation and Ramsey interference measurements, demonstrate the gate-voltage dependence of the qubit frequency, and measure the qubit anharmonicity. The reported proof-of-concept reproduces the results of a very recent work [Sagi et al., Nat. Commun. 15, 6400 (2024)] using similar SiGe heterostructures thereby validating a novel platform for the development of gatemons and parity-protected $\cos(2\phi)$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast all-optical generation of pure spin and valley currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure currents comprise the flow of a two state quantum freedom -- for example the electron spin -- in the absence of charge flow. Radically different from the charge currents that underpin present day electronics, in two dimensional materials possessing additional two state freedoms such as valley index they offer profound possibilities for miniaturization and energy efficiency in a next generation spin- and valley- tronics. Here we demonstrate a robust multi-pump light wave protocol capable of generating both pure spin and valley currents on femtosecond times. The generation time is determined by the 2d material gap, with the creation of pure spin current in WSe2 at 40 fs and pure valley current in bilayer graphene at ~200 fs. Our all-optical approach demands no special material design, requiring only a gapped valley active material, and is thus applicable to a wide range of 2d materials.</description>

      <title>Creation and control of valley currents in graphene by few cycle light pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well established for the visible spectrum gaps of the transition metal dichalcogenide family, valleytronics - the control of valley charge and current by light - is comparatively unexplored for the THz gaps that characterize graphene and topological insulators. Here we show that few cycle pulses of THz light can create and control a 100% valley polarized current in graphene, with light wave control over the current magnitude and direction. The latter is equal to an emergent pulse property of few cycle circularly polarized pulses, the "global" carrier envelope phase. Our findings both highlight the richness of few cycle light pulses in control over quantum matter, and provide a route towards a "THz valleytronics" in meV gapped systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene twisted at the angle of about 1.1{\deg} better known as magic angle, exhibits ultra-flat moir\'e superlattice bands that are a source of highly-tunable, exotic quantum phenomena. Such phenomena, like superconductivity, correlated Mott-like insulating states and orbital ferromagnetism are driven by strong-correlation physics that defies classical theories. The inadequacy of such classical models and the lack of theoretical understanding of the recently observed exotic phenomena calls for revisiting the theory behind the material system and associating it with the observed behaviour. This article reviews the physics behind twisted bilayer graphene, focusing primarily on moir\'e physics and the importance of electronic (flat) band structure. In addition, this paper provides a brief overview of the emerging phenomena of correlated insulating states, superconductivity and orbital ferromagnetism. Finally, the most recent developments in controlling the interaction-driven states and tuning the electronic interactions are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense electromagnetic fields can result in dramatic changes in the electronic properties of solids. These changes are commonly studied using optical probes of the modified electronic structure. Here we use optical-scanning tunneling microscopy (optical-STM) equipped with near-field continuous wave (CW) laser excitation to directly measure the electronic structure of light-dressed states in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor, WSe2. We find that the effective tunneling gap and tunneling density of states are strongly influenced by the intensity of the electromagnetic field when the applied field is resonant with the bandgap of the semiconductor. Our findings indicate that CW laser excitation can be used to generate light-dressed electronic states of quantum materials when confined strongly to the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Trion Engineered Multimodal Transistors in Two dimensional Bilayer Semiconductor Lateral Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal device operations are essential to advancing the integration of 2D semiconductors in electronics, photonics, information and quantum technology. Precise control over carrier dynamics, particularly exciton generation and transport, is crucial for finetuning the functionality of optoelectronic devices based on 2D semiconductor heterostructure. However, the traditional exciton engineering methods in 2D semiconductors are mainly restricted to the artificially assembled vertical pn heterostructures with electrical or strain induced confinements. In this study, we utilized bilayer 2D lateral npn multijunction heterostructures with intrinsically spatially separated energy landscapes to achieve preferential exciton generation and manipulation without external confinement. In lateral npn FET geometry, we uncover unique and nontrivial properties, including dynamic tuning of channel photoresponsivity from positive to negative. The multimodal operation of these 2D FETs is achieved by carefully adjusting electrical bias and the impinging photon energy, enabling precise control over the trions generation and transport. Cryogenic photoluminescence measurement revealed the presence of trions in bilayer MoSe2 and intrinsic trap states in WSe2. Measurements in different FET device geometries show the multifunctionality of 2D lateral heterostructure phototransistors for efficient tuning and electrical manipulation of excitonic characteristics. Our findings pave the way for developing practical exciton-based transistors, sensors, multimodal optoelectronic and quantum technologies</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detailed mechanism of bonding in the cold spray process has remained elusive for both experimental and theoretical parties. Adiabatic shear instability and hydrodynamic plasticity models have been so far the most popular explanations. Here, using molecular dynamics simulation, we investigate their validity at the nanoscale. The present study has potential application for the fabrication of ultra-thin layers for the electronics industry. For this aim, we considered Ti nanoparticles of different diameters and Si substrates of different orientations. It is shown that very high spray velocities are required for a jet to be observed at the nanoscale. We propose a method for thermostating the substrate that enables utilizing high spray velocities. For the first time, we demonstrate an oscillatory behavior in both the normal and radial stress components within the substrate that can propagate into the particle. We have shown that neither the adiabatic shear instability model nor the hydrodynamic plasticity model can be ignored at the nanoscale. Besides, the formation of a low-resistance titanium silicide proper for electronic application is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Pyridyl-functionalized tripod molecules on Au(111): Interplay between H-bonding and metal coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-assembly of pyridyl-functionalized triazine (T4PT) was studied on Au(111) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) under ultra-high vacuum conditions combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, we investigated the effect of temperature on the intermolecular interactions within the assemblies. STM measurements revealed that T4PT molecules form a well-ordered, close-packed structure, with the molecules adopting a planar conformation parallel to the Au surface for coverages $\leq1$ monolayer upon room temperature deposition. The intermolecular interactions stabilizing the self-assembled arrangement is based on a combination of hydrogen bonding and weak van der Waals forces. Upon post-deposition annealing, the assemblies are additionally stabilized by metal-ligand bonding between the pyridyl ligands and native Au adatoms. Further post-deposition annealing at temperatures above $200^{\circ}$C led to the breaking of the N-Au bonds with the molecular assemblies transforming into a second close-packed hydrogen bonded structure. For temperatures exceeding $230^{\circ}$C, few covalently linked dimers formed, most likely as a result of CH-bond activation. We rationalize the kinetically-driven structure formation by unveiling the interaction strengths of the bonding motifs using DFT and compare the molecular conformation to the structurally similar pyridyl-functionalized benzene (T4PB).</description>

      <title>Synergistic Interface Effects in Composite Dielectrics: Insights into Charge Trapping Regulation through Multiscale Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of modern energy applications drives an urgent need to enhance the dielectric strength of energy storage dielectrics for higher power density. Interface design is a promising strategy to regulate the crucial charge transport process determining dielectric strength. However, the targeted exploitation of interface effects on charge transport is limited due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms involving elementary electronic processes and details of the intricate interplay of characteristics of molecular building blocks and the interfacial morphology -- details that cannot fully be resolved with experimental methods. Here we employ a multiscale modeling approach linking the quantum properties of the charge carriers with nano- and mesoscale structural details of complex interfaces. Applied to a prototypical application-proven cellulose-oil composite with interfaces formed between oil, disordered, and crystalline cellulose regions, this approach demonstrates that charges are trapped in the disordered region. Specifically, it unveils this trapping as a synergistic effect of two transport-regulating interface mechanisms: back-transfer to the oil region is suppressed by energetic factors, while forward-transfer to the crystalline cellulose is suppressed by low electronic coupling. The insight into the molecular origins of interface effects via dual-interface regulation offers new development paths for advanced energy materials.</description>

      <title>Imprinting electrically switchable scalar spin chirality by anisotropic strain in a Kagome antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying strain to epitaxial thin films has proven to be an effective approach for controlling material properties, paving the way for "materials by design". In this study, we explore this concept in the context of topological Kagome antiferromagnets, which can exhibit a range of exotic magnetic states. One such material, Mn$_{3}$Sn, features a non-collinear yet coplanar inverse triangular spin order that lacks scalar spin chirality. By applying anisotropic strain to reduce the point group symmetry of the Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, and utilizing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in epitaxial Mn$_{3}$Sn heterostructures, we achieve a canting of the manganese spins out of the Kagome plane. This newly induced magnetic state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature, which can be fully controlled by charge current, enabling the realization of multiple-stable antiferromagnetic memory states.</description>

      <title>Magic states are rarely the most important resource to optimize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scaling approach to evaluating the qubit resources required by concatenated fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach gives closed-form expressions, which remain simple for multiple levels of concatenation, making it an ideal tool to compare and minimize the resource costs of different concatenation schemes. We then use it to study the resources required for normal and magic operations. Here, magic operations require the preparation, verification and injection of complicated states called "magic states", while normal operations do not. It is often expected that magic operations will dominate a computation's physical resource requirements (qubits, gates, etc.), although this expectation has been cast in doubt for surface codes. Our results show that this expectation is also wrong for typical concatenated codes, with magic operations rarely being costly. We give concrete examples for the concatenated 7-qubit scheme with Steane error-correction gadgets or a flag-qubits approach. While optimizations that affect all operations are naturally more effective than ones that affect only magic operations, the surprising conclusion of our work is that the former can reduce costs by several orders of magnitude whereas the latter contributes only marginal reductions. This is particularly surprising given the numerous works on optimizations that affect only magic operations.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermionic charge and current densities in conical space with a circular edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite temperature and edge induced effects on the charge and current densities for a massive spinor field localized on a 2D conical space threaded by a magnetic flux. The field operator is constrained on a circular boundary, concentric with the cone apex, by the bag boundary condition and by the condition with the opposite sign in front of the term containing the normal to the edge. In two-dimensional spaces there exist two inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra and the analysis is presented for both the fields realizing those representations. The circular boundary divides the conical space into two parts, referred as interior (I-) and exterior (E-) regions. The radial current density vanishes. The edge induced contributions in the expectation values of the charge and azimuthal current densities are explicitly separated in the both regions for the general case of the chemical potential. They are periodic functions of the magnetic flux and odd functions under the simultaneous change of the signs of magnetic flux and chemical potential. In the E-region all the spinorial modes are regular and the total charge and current densities are continuous functions of the magnetic flux. In the I-region the corresponding expectation values are discontinuous at half-integer values of the ratio of the magnetic flux to the flux quantum. 2D fermionic models, symmetric under the parity and time-reversal transformations (in the absence of magnetic fields) combine two spinor fields realizing the inequivalent representations of the Clifford algebra. The total charge and current densities in those models are discussed for different combinations of the boundary conditions for separate fields. Applications are discussed for electronic subsystem in graphitic cones described by the 2D Dirac model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir-Polder interaction between a two-level atomic system and a Chern insulator for both the resonant and nonresonant channels. For a right circularly polarized excited atomic state near a Chern insulator with a negative Chern number $C$, the resonant Casimir-Polder force can be monotonically repulsive over a large range of separations. In the presence of the same Chern insulator, a right circularly polarized metastable atomic state is expected to experience a repulsive nonresonant Casimir-Polder force over a certain range of atom-surface separations in the far-field region. At still greater separations, the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force is expected to become attractive and exhibit a topological signature, being proportional to $(C\alpha)^2/(1+(C\alpha)^2)$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme for multi-scale phonon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate predictions of the spatiotemporal distributions of temperature are crucial to the multi-scale thermal management and safe operation of microelectronic devices. To realize it, an efficient semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for numerically solving the transient phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) from the ballistic to diffusive regime. The phonon BTE at the cell center is discretized under the framework of finite volume method, where the trapezoidal and midpoint rules are used to deal with the temporal integration of phonon scattering and convection terms, respectively. For the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function, the phonon BTE at the cell interface is discretized in the form of finite difference method and solved numerically, where second-order upwind and central scheme are used to deal with the spatial interpolation and gradient of interfacial distribution function, respectively. The macroscopic governing equations are invoked for the evolution of macroscopic fields at both the cell center and interface, where the macroscopic flux is obtained by taking the moment of the interfacial distribution function. Numerical results show that the present scheme could accurately predict the steady/unsteady heat conduction in solid materials from the ballistic to diffusive regime, and its time and cell size are not limited by the relaxation time and phonon mean free path. The present work could provide a useful tool for the efficient predictions of the macroscopic spatiotemporal distributions in the multi-scale thermal engineering.</description>

Abstract: Defect engineering in two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for advancing applications such as gas sensing, single-atom catalysis, and guided nanoparticle self-assembly, enabling the creation of materials with tailored functionalities. This study investigates ion implantation effects on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations to identify distinct defect structures. High-energy heavy ions cause inelastic scattering, increasing surface damage, while gold atoms deposited onto defect sites preferentially form atomic clusters. Through focused ion beam techniques, spatially distributed defects were engineered, guiding the self-assembly of nanoparticles. This research highlights the precision of ion irradiation for modifying HOPG surfaces, with significant implications for catalysis, nanotechnology, and the development of functional materials with controlled nanoscale properties.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Monolayer MoS2 Devices Free of Resist Contamination by Gold Mask Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin MoS2 is a promising material for field-effect transistors (FETs) and electronic devices. However, traditional photolithographic processes introduce surface contamination to 2D materials, leading to poor electrical contacts when metals are deposited. In this work, we present a novel fabrication method using gold as a mask for patterning and etching, which protects 2D materials from contamination in the metal contact region. This technique enabled the fabrication of monolayer MoS2 transistors with clean gold contacts. Additionally, we achieved MoS2 devices with Ohmic contacts, mass-produced traditional lithography and gold mask lithography devices (100 of each), with the latter having a much higher current statistical variance than the former, which demonstrated the effectiveness of this method for contamination-free 2D transistors and potential applications in integrated circuits</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled molecular monolayer doping remains as a research focus for its nature of being conformal, nondestructive, and self-limiting. Herein, we demonstrate a sulfur monolayer doping in GaAs, facilitated by (NH4)2Sx solution. The Van der Pauw technique, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and low-temperature Hall effect measurements show that the sulfur dopants concentration and electron activation rate are 4*10^20 cm-3 and 77.6%, respectively. The donor energy level of sulfur-doped GaAs is located 68 meV below the conduction band. Based on this process, a p-n junction was successfully fabricated on highly doped p-type GaAs substrate.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned nodal structures of Fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in quantum physics is the accurate simulation of fermionic systems, particularly those involving strong correlations. While effective for bosonic systems, traditional quantum Monte Carlo methods encounter the notorious sign problem when applied to Fermions, often resulting in biased outcomes through the fixed-node approximation. This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to address these limitations by allowing nodal structures to be learned through gradient descent optimization iterations and the variational algorithm. Using a neural network to represent the wave function, we focus on quantum dots containing up to 30 electrons. The results show a significant reduction in the variational bias, achieving greater accuracy and a lower ground state energy than diffusion Monte Carlo with the fixed-node approximation. Our approach paves the way for precise and accurate property predictions in fermionic strongly correlated systems, advancing fundamental understanding and applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Graphene-based Sub-Terahertz Receivers enabling Wireless Communications for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the telecommunications field has experienced an unparalleled proliferation of wireless data traffic. Innovative solutions are imperative to circumvent the inherent limitations of the current technology, in particular in terms of capacity. Carrier frequencies in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) range (~0.2-0.3 THz) can deliver increased capacity and low attenuation for short-range wireless applications. Here, we demonstrate a direct, passive and compact sub-THz receiver based on graphene, which outperforms state-of-the-art sub-THz receivers. These graphene-based receivers offer a cost-effective, CMOS-compatible, small-footprint solution that can fulfill the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) requirements of 6G technologies. We exploit a sub-THz cavity, comprising an antenna and a back mirror, placed in the vicinity of the graphene channel to overcome the low inherent absorption in graphene and the mismatch between the areas of the photoactive region and the incident radiation, which becomes extreme in the sub-THz range. The graphene receivers achieve a multigigabit per second data rate with a maximum distance of ~3 m from the transmitter, a setup-limited 3 dB bandwidth of 40 GHz, and a high responsivity of 0.16 A/W, enabling applications such as chip-to-chip communication and close proximity device-to-device communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At low temperatures, the transport coefficients in the disordered electron gas acquire quantum corrections as a result of the complex interplay of disorder and interactions. The interaction corrections to the electric conductivity have their origin in virtual processes with typical electronic energies far exceeding the temperature. Here, we study interaction corrections $\delta S$ to the thermopower $S$ of the two-dimensional disordered electron gas with long-range Coulomb interactions. We show that while both real and virtual processes contribute to these corrections, the real processes are dominant and lead to a logarithmic temperature dependence of $\delta S/S$ with $\delta S/S&lt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider spin injection driven by nonequilibrium chiral phonons from a chiral insulator into an adjacent metal. Phonon-spin conversion arises from the coupling of the electron spin with the microrotation associated with chiral phonons. We derive a microscopic formula for the spin injection rate at a metal-insulator interface. Our results clearly illustrate the microscopic origin of spin current generation by chiral phonons and may lead to a breakthrough in the development of spintronic devices without heavy elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer moir\'e materials can exhibit topological electronic features yet are inherently quasiperiodic -- leading to wave function interference whose Anderson-localizing tendency can be mitigated by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials that serves as a toy model for twisted trilayer. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Interface engineering of van der Waals heterostructures towards energy-efficient quantum devices operating at high temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum devices, which rely on quantum mechanical effects for their operation, may offer advantages, such as reduced dimensions, increased speed, and energy efficiency, compared to conventional devices. However, quantum phenomena are typically observed only at cryogenic temperatures, which limits their practical applications. Two-dimensional materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures provide a promising platform for high-temperature quantum devices owing to their strong Coulomb interactions and/or spin-orbit coupling. In this review, we summarise recent research on emergent quantum phenomena in vdW heterostructures based on interlayer tunnelling and the coupling of charged particles and spins, including negative differential resistance, Josephson tunnelling, exciton condensation, and topological superconductivity. These are the underlying mechanisms of energy-efficient devices, including tunnel field-effect transistors, topological/superconducting transistors, and quantum computers. The natural homojunction within vdW layered materials offers clean interfaces and perfectly aligned structures for enhanced interlayer coupling. Twisted bilayers with small angles may also give rise to novel quantum effects. In addition, we highlight several proposed structures for achieving high-temperature Majorana zero modes, which are critical elements of topological quantum computing. This review is helpful for researchers working on interface engineering of vdW heterostructures towards energy-efficient quantum devices operating above the liquid nitrogen temperature.</description>

      <title>Proof of bulk-edge correspondence for band topology by Toeplitz algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously yet concisely prove the bulk-edge correspondence for general $d$-dimensional ($d$D) topological insulators in complex Altland-Zirnbauer classes, which states that the bulk topological number equals to the edge-mode index. Specifically, an essential formula is discovered that links the quantity expressed by Toeplitz algebra, i.e., hopping terms on the lattice with an edge, to the Fourier series on the bulk Brillouin zone. We then apply it to chiral models and utilize exterior differential calculations, instead of the sophisticated \emph{K}-theory, to show that the winding number of bulk system equals to the Fredholm index of 1D edge Hamiltonian, or to the sum of edge winding numbers for higher odd dimensions. Moreover, this result is inherited to the even-dimensional Chern insulators as each of them can be mapped to an odd-dimensional chiral model. It is revealed that the Chern number of bulk system is identical to the spectral flow of 2D edge Hamiltonian, or to the negative sum of edge Chern numbers for higher even dimensions. Our methods and conclusions are friendly to physicists and could be easily extended to other physical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport plays a key role in characterizing topological insulators and semimetals. Understanding the effect of disorder is crucial to assess the robustness of experimental signatures for topology. In this work, we find the absence of localization in nodal line semimetals for long-range scalar disorder and a large range of disorder strengths. Using a continuum transfer matrix approach, we find that the conductivity in the plane and out of the plane of the nodal line increases with system size and disorder strength. We substantiate these findings by a perturbative calculation and show that the conductivity increases with disorder strength using the Kubo formula in the self-consistent Born approximation. We also find that the system remains metallic for vector disorder and that vector disorder can drive a transition from an insulating to a metallic regime. Our results demonstrate the absence of localization in a three-dimensional bulk system.</description>

      <title>Multifractality of Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates induced by nonreciprocal dissipation, plays a pivotal role in non-Hermitian topology and significantly influences the open quantum dynamics. However, its genuinely quantum characterization in many-body systems has yet to be developed. Here, we elucidate that the skin effect manifests itself as multifractality in the many-body Hilbert space. This multifractality does not accompany the single-particle skin effect and hence is intrinsic to the many-body skin effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the many-body skin effect coexists with spectral statistics of random matrices, in contrast to multifractality associated with the many-body localization, which necessitates the absence of ergodicity. We also illustrate multifractality caused by the Liouvillian skin effect in Markovian open quantum systems. Our work establishes a defining characterization of the non-Hermitian skin effect and uncovers a fundamental relationship between multifractality and ergodicity in open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding and utilizing the inner bonds of process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs) enable numerically exact simulations for an unprecedentedly broad range of open quantum systems. By representing environment influences in MPO form, they can be efficiently compressed using established algorithms. The dimensions of inner bonds of the compressed PT-MPO may be viewed as an indicator of the complexity of the environment. Here, we show that the inner bonds themselves, not only their dimensions, have a concrete physical meaning: They represent the subspace of the full environment Liouville space which hosts environment excitations that may influence the subsequent open quantum systems dynamics the most. This connection can be expressed in terms of lossy linear transformations, whose pseudoinverses facilitate the extraction of environment observables. We demonstrate this by extracting the environment spin of a central spin problem, the current through a quantum system coupled to two leads, the number of photons emitted from quantum emitters into a structured environment, and the distribution of the total absorbed energy in a driven non-Markovian quantum system into system, environment, and interaction energy terms. Numerical tests further indicate that different PT-MPO algorithms compress environments to similar subspaces. Thus, the physical interpretation of inner bonds of PT-MPOs both provides a conceptional understanding and it enables new practical applications.</description>

      <title>Polyvalent Machine-Learned Potential for Cobalt: from Bulk to Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the development and applications of a quadratic Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (q-SNAP) for ferromagnetic cobalt. Trained on Density Functional Theory calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (DFT-PBE) functional, this machine-learned potential enables simulations of large systems over extended time scales across a wide range of temperatures and pressures at near DFT accuracy. It is validated by closely reproducing the phonon dispersions of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Co, surface energies, and the relative stability of nanoparticles of various shapes. An important feature of this novel potential is its numerical stability in long molecular dynamics simulations. This robustness is exploited to compute the heat capacity of nanoparticles containing up to 9201 atoms, showing convergence to less than 2 J.K-1.mol-1 after 100 ns. Computations of the melting temperature of nanoparticles as a function of their size revealed a convergence to the bulk limit in excellent agreement with the experimental value. Thus, the new, highly accurate machine-learned potential for Co opens exciting opportunities for further applications such as the dynamics of nanoparticles in catalytic reactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to quantum impurity systems consisting of several sites and the single impurity Anderson model to study the relationship between their states and the behaviors of quantum informative quantities. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

Abstract: Fluxonium qubit is a promising building block for quantum information processing due to its long coherence time and strong anharmonicity. In this paper, we realize a 60 ns direct CNOT-gate on two inductively-coupled fluxonium qubits using selective darkening approach, resulting in a gate fidelity as high as 99.94%. The fidelity remains above 99.9% for 24 days without any recalibration between randomized benchmarking measurements. Compared with the 99.96% fidelity of a 60 ns identity gate, our data brings the investigation of the non-decoherence-related errors during gate operations down to $2 \times 10^{-4}$. The present result adds a simple and robust two-qubit gate into the still relatively small family of "the beyond three nines" demonstrations on superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and non-Hermiticity in free-fermion systems</title>

Abstract: This topical review article reports rapid progress on the generalization and application of entanglement in non-Hermitian free-fermion quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various concrete studies, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions. Through this review, we hope to provide a useful guide for researchers who are interested in entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of the electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals induced by an intense single-cycle terahertz pulse. The effect reveals itself as a transient change of the polarization state of a femtosecond laser pulse reflected from the crystal that is exposed to the terahertz electric field. The corresponding experimental signal is apparently instantaneous with respect to the field and contains a linear (Pockels) and a quadratic (Kerr) components of comparable magnitude. The latter does not depend on the crystal orientation, while the former demonstrates three-fold rotational symmetry in agreement with the trigonal symmetry of the crystal surface. The electro-optic effect vanishes upon phase transition to the non-topological metal state induced by indium doping and also can be quenched by a femtosecond pre-pulse. We associate this effect with surface Dirac electronic states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and discuss its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>
