      <title>Information Dynamics in Evolving Networks Based on the Birth-Death Process: Random Drift and Natural Selection Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic processes in complex networks are crucial for better understanding collective behavior in human societies, biological systems, and the internet. In this paper, we first focus on the continuous Markov-based modeling of evolving networks with the birth-death of individuals. A new individual arrives at the group by the Poisson process, while new links are established in the network through either uniform connection or preferential attachment. Moreover, an existing individual has a limited lifespan before leaving the network. We determine stationary topological properties of these networks, including their size and mean degree. To address the effect of the birth-death evolution, we further study the information dynamics in the proposed network model from the random drift and natural selection perspective, based on assumptions of total-stochastic and fitness-driven evolution, respectively. In simulations, we analyze the fixation probability of individual information and find that means of new connections affect the random drift process but do not affect the natural selection process.</description>

      <title>A Return to Biased Nets: New Specifications and Approximate Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biased net paradigm was the first general and empirically tractable scheme for parameterizing complex patterns of dependence in networks, expressing deviations from uniform random graph structure in terms of latent ``bias events,'' whose realizations enhance reciprocity, transitivity, or other structural features. Subsequent developments have introduced local specifications of biased nets, which reduce the need for approximations required in early specifications based on tracing processes. Here, we show that while one such specification leads to inconsistencies, a closely related Markovian specification both evades these difficulties and can be extended to incorporate new types of effects. We introduce the notion of inhibitory bias events, with satiation as an example, which are useful for avoiding degeneracies that can arise from closure bias terms. Although our approach does not lead to a computable likelihood, we provide a strategy for approximate Bayesian inference using random forest prevision. We demonstrate our approach on a network of friendship ties among college students, recapitulating a relationship between the sibling bias and tie strength posited in earlier work by Fararo.</description>

      <title>Cascades towards noise-induced transitions on networks revealed using information flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt, system-wide transitions can be endogenously generated by seemingly stable networks of interacting dynamical units, such as mode switching in neuronal networks or public opinion changes in social systems. However, it remains poorly understood how such `noise-induced transitions' emerge from the interplay of network structure and dynamics on the network. Here, we report on two key roles that nodes can play in the progression towards noise-induced tipping points. The models used are dynamical networks where the nodes are governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, but the concept is easily generalized. First, so-called `initiator nodes' absorb and then transmit short-lived fluctuations to neighboring nodes, making them temporarily more dynamic. These neighbor nodes can then in turn transmit fluctuations to their neighbors, and so on, leading to a domino-effect where the more stable a node is (i.e., high average free energy barrier), the more neighbors are needed that have become temporarily dynamic. Interestingly, towards the tipping point we identify so-called `stabilizer nodes' whose state information becomes part of the long-term memory of the system, after which the domino-effect is reversed and settles the node in their new stable attractor. We validate these roles by targeted interventions that make tipping points more (or less) likely to begin or lead to systemic change. This opens up possibilities for understanding and controlling endogenously generated metastable behavior.</description>

      <title>COMET: NFT Price Prediction with Wallet Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the non-fungible token (NFT) market flourishes, price prediction emerges as a pivotal direction for investors gaining valuable insight to maximize returns. However, existing works suffer from a lack of practical definitions and standardized evaluations, limiting their practical application. Moreover, the influence of users' multi-behaviour transactions that are publicly accessible on NFT price is still not explored and exhibits challenges. In this paper, we address these gaps by presenting a practical and hierarchical problem definition. This approach unifies both collection-level and token-level task and evaluation methods, which cater to varied practical requirements of investors. To further understand the impact of user behaviours on the variation of NFT price, we propose a general wallet profiling framework and develop a COmmunity enhanced Multi-bEhavior Transaction graph model, named COMET. COMET profiles wallets with a comprehensive view and considers the impact of diverse relations and interactions within the NFT ecosystem on NFT price variations, thereby improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments conducted in our deployed system demonstrate the superiority of COMET, underscoring its potential in the insight toolkit for NFT investors.</description>

      <title>Implicit degree bias in the link prediction task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link prediction -- a task of distinguishing actual hidden edges from random unconnected node pairs -- is one of the quintessential tasks in graph machine learning. Despite being widely accepted as a universal benchmark and a downstream task for representation learning, the validity of the link prediction benchmark itself has been rarely questioned. Here, we show that the common edge sampling procedure in the link prediction task has an implicit bias toward high-degree nodes and produces a highly skewed evaluation that favors methods overly dependent on node degree, to the extent that a ``null'' link prediction method based solely on node degree can yield nearly optimal performance. We propose a degree-corrected link prediction task that offers a more reasonable assessment that aligns better with the performance in the recommendation task. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree-corrected benchmark can more effectively train graph machine-learning models by reducing overfitting to node degrees and facilitating the learning of relevant structures in graphs.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Network Robustness Evaluation Based on Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatial Pyramid Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connectivity robustness, a crucial aspect for understanding, optimizing, and repairing complex networks, has traditionally been evaluated through time-consuming and often impractical simulations. Fortunately, machine learning provides a new avenue for addressing this challenge. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including the performance in more general edge removal scenarios, capturing robustness through attack curves instead of directly training for robustness, scalability of predictive tasks, and transferability of predictive capabilities. In this paper, we address these challenges by designing a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model with spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPP-net), adapting existing evaluation metrics, redesigning the attack modes, introducing appropriate filtering rules, and incorporating the value of robustness as training data. The results demonstrate the thoroughness of the proposed CNN framework in addressing the challenges of high computational time across various network types, failure component types and failure scenarios. However, the performance of the proposed CNN model varies: for evaluation tasks that are consistent with the trained network type, the proposed CNN model consistently achieves accurate evaluations of both attack curves and robustness values across all removal scenarios. When the predicted network type differs from the trained network, the CNN model still demonstrates favorable performance in the scenario of random node failure, showcasing its scalability and performance transferability. Nevertheless, the performance falls short of expectations in other removal scenarios. This observed scenario-sensitivity in the evaluation of network features has been overlooked in previous studies and necessitates further attention and optimization. Lastly, we discuss important unresolved questions and further investigation.</description>

      <title>HetCAN: A Heterogeneous Graph Cascade Attention Network with Dual-Level Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks(HGNNs) have recently shown impressive capability in modeling heterogeneous graphs that are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Most existing methods for heterogeneous graphs mainly learn node embeddings by stacking multiple convolutional or attentional layers, which can be considered as capturing the high-order information from node-level aspect. However, different types of nodes in heterogeneous graphs have diverse features, it is also necessary to capture interactions among node features, namely the high-order information from feature-level aspect. In addition, most methods first align node features by mapping them into one same low-dimensional space, while they may lose some type information of nodes in this way. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph Cascade Attention Network (HetCAN) composed of multiple cascade blocks. Each cascade block includes two components, the type-aware encoder and the dimension-aware encoder. Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and aims to make full use of graph heterogeneity. The dimension-aware encoder is able to learn the feature-level high-order information by capturing the interactions among node features. With the assistance of these components, HetCAN can comprehensively encode information of node features, graph heterogeneity and graph structure in node embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HetCAN over advanced competitors and also exhibit its efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>SynHING: Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network Generation for Graph Learning and Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in delineating graph structures in diverse domains, including community analysis and recommendation systems. As the interpretation of GNNs becomes increasingly important, the demand for robust baselines and expansive graph datasets is accentuated, particularly in the context of Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN). Addressing this, we introduce SynHING, a novel framework for Synthetic Heterogeneous Information Network Generation aimed at enhancing graph learning and explanation. SynHING systematically identifies major motifs in a target HIN and employs a bottom-up generation process with intra-cluster and inter-cluster merge modules. This process, supplemented by post-pruning techniques, ensures the synthetic HIN closely mirrors the original graph's structural and statistical properties. Crucially, SynHING provides ground-truth motifs for evaluating GNN explainer models, setting a new standard for explainable, synthetic HIN generation and contributing to the advancement of interpretable machine learning in complex networks.</description>

      <title>A Graph is Worth $K$ Words: Euclideanizing Graph using Pure Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can we model Non-Euclidean graphs as pure language or even Euclidean vectors while retaining their inherent information? The Non-Euclidean property have posed a long term challenge in graph modeling. Despite recent graph neural networks and graph transformers efforts encoding graphs as Euclidean vectors, recovering the original graph from vectors remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce GraphsGPT, featuring an Graph2Seq encoder that transforms Non-Euclidean graphs into learnable Graph Words in the Euclidean space, along with a GraphGPT decoder that reconstructs the original graph from Graph Words to ensure information equivalence. We pretrain GraphsGPT on $100$M molecules and yield some interesting findings: (1) The pretrained Graph2Seq excels in graph representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on $8/9$ graph classification and regression tasks. (2) The pretrained GraphGPT serves as a strong graph generator, demonstrated by its strong ability to perform both few-shot and conditional graph generation. (3) Graph2Seq+GraphGPT enables effective graph mixup in the Euclidean space, overcoming previously known Non-Euclidean challenges. (4) The edge-centric pretraining framework GraphsGPT demonstrates its efficacy in graph domain tasks, excelling in both representation and generation.

      <title>Large Language Models Reflect Human Citation Patterns with a Heightened Citation Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Citation practices are crucial in shaping the structure of scientific knowledge, yet they are often influenced by contemporary norms and biases. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 introduces a new dynamic to these practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a dataset of 166 papers from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge cut-off date, encompassing 3,066 references in total. In our experiment, GPT-4 was tasked with suggesting scholarly references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias in GPT-4, which persists even after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and venue. Additionally, we observe a large consistency between the characteristics of GPT-4's existing and non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references recommended by GPT-4 are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific knowledge dissemination. Our results underscore the need for identifying the model's biases and for developing balanced methods to interact with LLMs in general.</description>
