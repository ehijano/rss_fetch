      <title>A two-dimensional swarmalator model with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a simple two-dimensional swarmalator model that incorporates higher-order phase interactions, uncovering a diverse range of collective states. The latter include spatially coherent and gas-like configurations, neither of which appear in models with only pairwise interactions. Additionally, we discover bistability between various states, a phenomenon that arises directly from the inclusion of higher-order interactions. By analyzing several of these emergent states analytically, both for identical and nonidentical populations of swarmalators, we gain deeper insights into their underlying mechanisms and stability conditions. Our findings broaden the understanding of swarmalator dynamics and open new avenues for exploring complex collective behaviors in systems governed by higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Objective-Driven Dynamical Stochastic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fields offer a versatile approach for describing complex systems composed of interacting and dynamic components. In particular, some of these dynamical and stochastic systems may exhibit goal-directed behaviors aimed at achieving specific objectives, which we refer to as $\textit{intelligent fields}$. However, due to their inherent complexity, it remains challenging to develop a formal theoretical description of such systems and to effectively translate these descriptions into practical applications. In this paper, we propose three fundamental principles -- complete configuration, locality, and purposefulness -- to establish a theoretical framework for understanding intelligent fields. Moreover, we explore methodologies for designing such fields from the perspective of artificial intelligence applications. This initial investigation aims to lay the groundwork for future theoretical developments and practical advances in understanding and harnessing the potential of such objective-driven dynamical stochastic fields.</description>

      <title>Fast and Modular Whole-Body Lagrangian Dynamics of Legged Robots with Changing Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and modular modeling of multi-legged robots (MLRs) is essential for resilient control, particularly under significant morphological changes caused by mechanical damage. Conventional fixed-structure models, often developed with simplifying assumptions for nominal gaits, lack the flexibility to adapt to such scenarios. To address this, we propose a fast modular whole-body modeling framework using Boltzmann-Hamel equations and screw theory, in which each leg's dynamics is modeled independently and assembled based on the current robot morphology. This singularity-free, closed-form formulation enables efficient design of model-based controllers and damage identification algorithms. Its modularity allows autonomous adaptation to various damage configurations without manual re-derivation or retraining of neural networks. We validate the proposed framework using a custom simulation engine that integrates contact dynamics, a gait generator, and local leg control. Comparative simulations against hardware tests on a hexapod robot with multiple leg damage confirm the model's accuracy and adaptability. Additionally, runtime analyses reveal that the proposed model is approximately three times faster than real-time, making it suitable for real-time applications in damage identification and recovery.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear contagion dynamics on dynamical networks: exact solutions ranging from consensus times to evolutionary trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nonlinear social contagion dynamics on dynamical networks, such as opinion formation, is crucial for gaining new insights into consensus and polarization. Similar to threshold-dependent complex contagions, the nonlinearity in adoption rates poses challenges for mean-field approximations. To address this theoretical gap, we focus on nonlinear binary-opinion dynamics on dynamical networks and analytically derive local configurations, specifically the distribution of opinions within any given focal individual's neighborhood. This exact local configuration of opinions, combined with network degree distributions, allows us to obtain exact solutions for consensus times and evolutionary trajectories. Our counterintuitive results reveal that neither biased assimilation (i.e., nonlinear adoption rates) nor preferences in local network rewiring -- such as in-group bias (preferring like-minded individuals) and the Matthew effect (preferring social hubs) -- can significantly slow down consensus. Among these three social factors, we find that biased assimilation is the most influential in accelerating consensus. Furthermore, our analytical method efficiently and precisely predicts the evolutionary trajectories of adoption curves arising from nonlinear contagion dynamics. Our work paves the way for enabling analytical predictions for general nonlinear contagion dynamics beyond opinion formation.</description>
