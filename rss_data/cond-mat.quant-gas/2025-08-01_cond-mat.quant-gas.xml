      <title>Reformulating Chemical Equilibrium in Reacting Quantum Gas Mixtures: Particle Number Conservation, Correlations and Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical-ensemble description of reactive quantum gas mixtures is reformulated by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation constraint over the combined spectra of inter-converting species. This constraint replaces the conventional equality of chemical potentials. Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein correlations naturally emerge across one-particle energy eigenstates of species sharing identical spin-statistics, which in ergodic single-systems manifest as intrinsic features of the equilibrium state. By embedding all microstates linked by conversion pathways, the framework incorporates concentration fluctuations in the statistical description. The formalism offers fresh insights into quantum chemical equilibrium in reactive mixtures with composition fluctuations and smoothly reduces to the classical ideal gas limit via an extended partition function that generalizes classical chemical-equilibrium treatments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source without a high-finesse cavity stabilized laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source achieved without the use of a high-finesse cavity-locked laser. Our frequency reference is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables sub-kHz linewidths. The long-term stability of the comb is defined by an external RF reference: either a 10 MHz RF signal from the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL), or a tunable RF source whose long-term stability is maintained by monitoring and stabilizing the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT). The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from the MOT. These results highlight the system's suitability for compact, robust, and field-deployable continuous cold atom devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum scarring enhances non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization. Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Area laws and thermalization from classical entropies in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture many features of their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased $k$-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without reconstructing the underlying state or measurement distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Universal Efimov Scaling in the Rabi-Coupled Few-Body Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Efimov effect -- a universal quantum few-body phenomenon -- in the presence of an external driving field. Specifically, we consider up to three bosonic atoms, such as $^{133}$Cs, interacting with a light atom, such as $^{6}$Li, where the latter has two internal spin states $\{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ that are Rabi coupled. Assuming that only the spin-$\uparrow$ light atom interacts with the bosons, we find that the Rabi drive transposes the entire Efimov spectrum such that the Efimov trimers and tetramers are centered around the Rabi-shifted two-body scattering resonance. Crucially, we show that the Rabi drive preserves the trimers' discrete scaling symmetry, while universally shifting the Efimov three-body parameter, leading to a log-periodic modulation in the spectrum as the Rabi drive is varied. Our results suggest that Efimov physics can be conveniently explored using an applied driving field, opening up the prospect of an externally tunable three-body parameter.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics after quantum quenches as hydrodynamic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistics of fluctuations on large regions of space encodes universal properties of many-body systems. At equilibrium, it is described by thermodynamics. However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches, the fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact results have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of the physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles, taking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in one-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic arguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in particular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these principles, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the structure of hydrodynamic modes and on the fluctuations in the initial state. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable models with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model for cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in fact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while long-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and non-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is expected to give all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Non-Stabilizerness of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>
