      <title>The HTTP Garden: Discovering Parsing Vulnerabilities in HTTP/1.1 Implementations by Differential Fuzzing of Request Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HTTP/1.1 parsing discrepancies have been the basis for numerous classes of attacks against web servers. Previous techniques for discovering HTTP parsing discrepancies have focused on blackbox differential testing of HTTP gateway servers, despite evidence that the most significant parsing anomalies occur within origin servers. While these techniques can detect some vulnerabilities, not all parsing discrepancy-related vulnerabilities are detectable by examining a gateway server's output alone. Our system, the HTTP Garden, examines both origin servers' interpretations and gateway servers' transformations of HTTP requests. It also includes a coverage-guided differential fuzzer for HTTP/1.1 origin servers that is capable of mutating all components of a request stream, paired with an interactive REPL that facilitates the automatic discovery of meaningful HTTP parsing discrepancies and the rapid development of those discrepancies into attack payloads. Using our tool, we have discovered and reported over 100 HTTP parsing bugs in popular web servers, of which 68 have been fixed following our reports. We designate 39 of these to be exploitable. We release the HTTP Garden to the public on GitHub under a free software license to allow researchers to further explore new parser discrepancy-based attacks against HTTP/1.1 servers.</description>

      <title>Remeasuring the Arbitrage and Sandwich Attacks of Maximal Extractable Value in Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) drives the prosperity of the blockchain ecosystem. By strategically including, excluding, or reordering transactions within blocks, block producers/validators can extract additional value, which in turn incentivizes them to keep the decentralization of the whole blockchain platform. Before The Merge of Ethereum in Sep. 2022, around \$675M was extracted in terms of MEV. Despite its importance, current measurement works on MEV suffer some limitations. First, current works only focus on transactions of a very limited number of DApps. Second, current methods heavily rely on fixed heuristic rule-based patterns, leading to false negative/positive. Third, the observations and conclusions are outdated to some extent due to the continuously introduced features, like The Merge in Ethereum. To address these challenges, in this work, we first propose two robust methods to identify arbitrage transactions and sandwich attacks, respectively. Then, we apply them to the largest-ever dataset to filter out related MEV transactions. Based on the identified results, we have characterized the overall landscape of the Ethereum MEV ecosystem, the impact the private transaction architectures bring, and the adoption of back-running mechanism. Our research will shed light on future MEV-related work.</description>

      <title>BlueSWAT: A Lightweight State-Aware Security Framework for Bluetooth Low Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short-range wireless communication technology for resource-constrained IoT devices. Unfortunately, BLE is vulnerable to session-based attacks, where previous packets construct exploitable conditions for subsequent packets to compromise connections. Defending against session-based attacks is challenging because each step in the attack sequence is legitimate when inspected individually. In this paper, we present BlueSWAT, a lightweight state-aware security framework for protecting BLE devices. To perform inspection on the session level rather than individual packets, BlueSWAT leverages a finite state machine (FSM) to monitor sequential actions of connections at runtime. Patterns of session-based attacks are modeled as malicious transition paths in the FSM. To overcome the heterogeneous IoT environment, we develop a lightweight eBPF framework to facilitate universal patch distribution across different BLE architectures and stacks, without requiring device reboot. We implement BlueSWAT on 5 real-world devices with different chips and stacks to demonstrate its cross-device adaptability. On our dataset with 101 real-world BLE vulnerabilities, BlueSWAT can mitigate 76.1% of session-based attacks, outperforming other defense frameworks. In our end-to-end application evaluation, BlueSWAT patches introduce an average of 0.073% memory overhead and negligible latency.</description>

      <title>Bringing Rust to Safety-Critical Systems in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of safety-critical aerospace systems is traditionally dominated by the C language. Its language characteristics make it trivial to accidentally introduce memory safety issues resulting in undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. The Rust language aims to drastically reduce the chance of introducing bugs and consequently produces overall more secure and safer code. However, due to its relatively short lifespan, industry adaption in safety-critical environments is still lacking. This work provides a set of recommendations for the development of safety-critical space systems in Rust. Our recommendations are based on insights from our multi-fold contributions towards safer and more secure aerospace systems: We provide a comprehensive overview of ongoing efforts to adapt Rust for safety-critical system programming, highlighting its potential to enhance system robustness. Next, we introduce a procedure for partially rewriting C-based systems in Rust, offering a pragmatic pathway to improving safety without necessitating a full system overhaul. During the execution of our rewriting case study, we identify and fix three previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in a popular open-source satellite communication protocol. Finally, we introduce a new Rust compiler target configuration for bare metal PowerPC. With this, we aim to broaden Rust's applicability in space-oriented projects, as the architecture is commonly encountered in the domain, e.g., in the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Crash Report Accumulation During Continuous Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crash report accumulation is a necessary step during continuous fuzzing. Dynamic software analysis techniques like fuzzing and dynamic symbolic execution generate a large number of crashes for analysis. However, the time and resource constraints often lead to the postponement of fixing some less critical issues, potentially introducing new errors in future releases. Thus, there is a need to distinguish new errors from old ones. We propose a crash accumulation method and implemented it as part of the CASR toolset. We evaluated our approach on crash reports collected from fuzzing results.</description>

      <title>Position Paper: Think Globally, React Locally -- Bringing Real-time Reference-based Website Phishing Detection on macOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. The recent surge in phishing attacks keeps undermining the effectiveness of the traditional anti-phishing blacklist approaches. On-device anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity as they offer faster phishing detection locally. Aim. We aim to eliminate the delay in recognizing and recording phishing campaigns in databases via on-device solutions that identify phishing sites immediately when encountered by the user rather than waiting for a web crawler's scan to finish. Additionally, utilizing operating system-specific resources and frameworks, we aim to minimize the impact on system performance and depend on local processing to protect user privacy. Method. We propose a phishing detection solution that uses a combination of computer vision and on-device machine learning models to analyze websites in real time. Our reference-based approach analyzes the visual content of webpages, identifying phishing attempts through layout analysis, credential input areas detection, and brand impersonation criteria combination. Results. Our case study shows it's feasible to perform background processing on-device continuously, for the case of the web browser requiring the resource use of 16% of a single CPU core and less than 84MB of RAM on Apple M1 while maintaining the accuracy of brand logo detection at 46.6% (comparable with baselines), and of Credential Requiring Page detection at 98.1% (improving the baseline by 3.1%), within the test dataset. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of on-device, real-time phishing detection systems to enhance cybersecurity defensive technologies and extend the scope of phishing detection to more similar regions of interest, e.g., email clients and messenger windows.</description>

      <title>Channel Reciprocity Based Attack Detection for Securing UWB Ranging by Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of ranging threats represented by Ghost Peak attack have raised concerns regarding the security performance of Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) systems with the finalization of the IEEE 802.15.4z standard. Based on channel reciprocity, this paper proposes a low complexity attack detection scheme that compares Channel Impulse Response (CIR) features of both ranging sides utilizing an autoencoder with the capability of data compression and feature extraction. Taking Ghost Peak attack as an example, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness, feasibility and generalizability of the proposed attack detection scheme through simulation and experimental validation. The proposed scheme achieves an attack detection success rate of over 99% and can be implemented in current systems at low cost.</description>

      <title>Blocking Tracking JavaScript at the Function Granularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern websites extensively rely on JavaScript to implement both functionality and tracking. Existing privacy enhancing content blocking tools struggle against mixed scripts, which simultaneously implement both functionality and tracking, because blocking the script would break functionality and not blocking it would allow tracking. We propose Not.js, a fine grained JavaScript blocking tool that operates at the function level granularity. Not.js's strengths lie in analyzing the dynamic execution context, including the call stack and calling context of each JavaScript function, and then encoding this context to build a rich graph representation. Not.js trains a supervised machine learning classifier on a webpage's graph representation to first detect tracking at the JavaScript function level and then automatically generate surrogate scripts that preserve functionality while removing tracking. Our evaluation of Not.js on the top 10K websites demonstrates that it achieves high precision (94%) and recall (98%) in detecting tracking JavaScript functions, outperforming the state of the art while being robust against off the shelf JavaScript obfuscation. Fine grained detection of tracking functions allows Not.js to automatically generate surrogate scripts that remove tracking JavaScript functions without causing major breakage. Our deployment of Not.js shows that mixed scripts are present on 62.3% of the top 10K websites, with 70.6% of the mixed scripts being third party that engage in tracking activities such as cookie ghostwriting. We share a sample of the tracking functions detected by Not.js within mixed scripts not currently on filter lists with filter list authors, who confirm that these scripts are not blocked due to potential functionality breakage, despite being known to implement tracking.</description>

      <title>FreezeAsGuard: Mitigating Illegal Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Selective Tensor Freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can be fine-tuned in custom domains to adapt to specific user preferences, but such unconstrained adaptability has also been utilized for illegal purposes, such as forging public figures' portraits and duplicating copyrighted artworks. Most existing work focuses on detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Other schemes of model unlearning and reinitialization, similarly, cannot prevent users from relearning the knowledge of illegal model adaptation with custom data. In this paper, we present FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. The basic approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate the fine-tuned model's representation power in illegal domains but minimize the impact on legal model adaptations in other domains. Such tensor freezing can be enforced via APIs provided by the model publisher for fine-tuning, can motivate users' adoption due to its computational savings. Experiment results with datasets in multiple domains show that FreezeAsGuard provides stronger power in mitigating illegal model adaptations of generating fake public figures' portraits, while having the minimum impact on model adaptation in other legal domains.

      <title>$\textit{Comet:}$ A $\underline{Com}$munication-$\underline{e}$fficient and Performant Approxima$\underline{t}$ion for Private Transformer Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalent use of Transformer-like models, exemplified by ChatGPT in modern language processing applications, underscores the critical need for enabling private inference essential for many cloud-based services reliant on such models. However, current privacy-preserving frameworks impose significant communication burden, especially for non-linear computation in Transformer model. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-in method Comet to effectively reduce the communication cost without compromising the inference performance. We second introduce an efficient approximation method to eliminate the heavy communication in finding good initial approximation. We evaluate our Comet on Bert and RoBERTa models with GLUE benchmark datasets, showing up to 3.9$\times$ less communication and 3.5$\times$ speedups while keep competitive model performance compared to the prior art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm where different parties collaboratively learn models using partitioned features of shared samples, without leaking private data. Recent research has shown promising results addressing various challenges in VFL, highlighting its potential for practical applications in cross-domain collaboration. However, the corresponding research is scattered and lacks organization. To advance VFL research, this survey offers a systematic overview of recent developments. First, we provide a history and background introduction, along with a summary of the general training protocol of VFL. We then revisit the taxonomy in recent reviews and analyze limitations in-depth. For a comprehensive and structured discussion, we synthesize recent research from three fundamental perspectives: effectiveness, security, and applicability. Finally, we discuss several critical future research directions in VFL, which will facilitate the developments in this field. We provide a collection of research lists and periodically update them at https://github.com/shentt67/VFL_Survey.</description>

      <title>Clip Body and Tail Separately: High Probability Guarantees for DPSGD with Heavy Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely utilized to preserve training data privacy in deep learning, which first clips the gradients to a predefined norm and then injects calibrated noise into the training procedure. Existing DPSGD works typically assume the gradients follow sub-Gaussian distributions and design various clipping mechanisms to optimize training performance. However, recent studies have shown that the gradients in deep learning exhibit a heavy-tail phenomenon, that is, the tails of the gradient have infinite variance, which may lead to excessive clipping loss to the gradients with existing DPSGD mechanisms. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, Discriminative Clipping~(DC)-DPSGD, with two key designs. First, we introduce a subspace identification technique to distinguish between body and tail gradients. Second, we present a discriminative clipping mechanism that applies different clipping thresholds for body and tail gradients to reduce the clipping loss. Under the non-convex condition, \ourtech{} reduces the empirical gradient norm from {${\mathbb{O}\left(\log^{\max(0,\theta-1)}(T/\delta)\log^{2\theta}(\sqrt{T})\right)}$} to {${\mathbb{O}\left(\log(\sqrt{T})\right)}$} with heavy-tailed index $\theta\geq 1/2$, iterations $T$, and arbitrary probability $\delta$. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms three baselines by up to 9.72\% in terms of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Pruning for Backdoor Mitigation: An Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing concerning threats to their reliable deployment. Recent research reveals that backdoors can be erased from infected DNNs by pruning a specific group of neurons, while how to effectively identify and remove these backdoor-associated neurons remains an open challenge. Most of the existing defense methods rely on defined rules and focus on neuron's local properties, ignoring the exploration and optimization of pruning policies. To address this gap, we propose an Optimized Neuron Pruning (ONP) method combined with Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to repair backdoor models. Specifically, ONP first models the target DNN as graphs based on neuron connectivity, and then uses GNN-based RL agents to learn graph embeddings and find a suitable pruning policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ GNN and RL for optimizing pruning policies in the field of backdoor defense. Experiments show, with a small amount of clean data, ONP can effectively prune the backdoor neurons implanted by a set of backdoor attacks at the cost of negligible performance degradation, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance for backdoor mitigation.</description>

      <title>Magnitude-based Neuron Pruning for Backdoor Defens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing concerning threats to their reliable deployment. Recent research reveals that backdoors can be erased from infected DNNs by pruning a specific group of neurons, while how to effectively identify and remove these backdoor-associated neurons remains an open challenge. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between backdoor behavior and neuron magnitude, and find that backdoor neurons deviate from the magnitude-saliency correlation of the model. The deviation inspires us to propose a Magnitude-based Neuron Pruning (MNP) method to detect and prune backdoor neurons. Specifically, MNP uses three magnitude-guided objective functions to manipulate the magnitude-saliency correlation of backdoor neurons, thus achieving the purpose of exposing backdoor behavior, eliminating backdoor neurons and preserving clean neurons, respectively. Experiments show our pruning strategy achieves state-of-the-art backdoor defense performance against a variety of backdoor attacks with a limited amount of clean data, demonstrating the crucial role of magnitude for guiding backdoor defenses.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Link Anomaly Detection in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in continuous-time dynamic graphs is an emerging field yet under-explored in the context of learning-based approaches. In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying anomalous links in these graphs. First, we introduce a fine-grain taxonomy for edge-level anomalies leveraging structural, temporal, and contextual graph properties. We present a method for generating and injecting such typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs with consistent patterns across time, structure, and context. To allow temporal graph methods to learn the link anomaly detection task, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Building on this, we benchmark methods for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art learning methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting link prediction methods for anomaly detection. Our results further reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies. We conclude with a comprehensive list of findings highlighting opportunities for future research.</description>

      <title>Exploiting LLM Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization leverages lower-precision weights to reduce the memory usage of large language models (LLMs) and is a key technique for enabling their deployment on commodity hardware. While LLM quantization's impact on utility has been extensively explored, this work for the first time studies its adverse effects from a security perspective. We reveal that widely used quantization methods can be exploited to produce a harmful quantized LLM, even though the full-precision counterpart appears benign, potentially tricking users into deploying the malicious quantized model. We demonstrate this threat using a three-staged attack framework: (i) first, we obtain a malicious LLM through fine-tuning on an adversarial task; (ii) next, we quantize the malicious model and calculate constraints that characterize all full-precision models that map to the same quantized model; (iii) finally, using projected gradient descent, we tune out the poisoned behavior from the full-precision model while ensuring that its weights satisfy the constraints computed in step (ii). This procedure results in an LLM that exhibits benign behavior in full precision but when quantized, it follows the adversarial behavior injected in step (i). We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and severity of such an attack across three diverse scenarios: vulnerable code generation, content injection, and over-refusal attack. In practice, the adversary could host the resulting full-precision model on an LLM community hub such as Hugging Face, exposing millions of users to the threat of deploying its malicious quantized version on their devices.</description>

      <title>Delving into Differentially Private Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning with differential privacy (DP) has garnered significant attention over the past years, leading to the development of numerous methods aimed at enhancing model accuracy and training efficiency. This paper delves into the problem of training Transformer models with differential privacy. Our treatment is modular: the logic is to `reduce' the problem of training DP Transformer to the more basic problem of training DP vanilla neural nets. The latter is better understood and amenable to many model-agnostic methods. Such `reduction' is done by first identifying the hardness unique to DP Transformer training: the attention distraction phenomenon and a lack of compatibility with existing techniques for efficient gradient clipping. To deal with these two issues, we propose the Re-Attention Mechanism and Phantom Clipping, respectively. We believe that our work not only casts new light on training DP Transformers but also promotes a modular treatment to advance research in the field of differentially private deep learning.</description>

      <title>The Round Complexity of Proofs in the Bounded Quantum Storage Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The round complexity of interactive proof systems is a key question of practical and theoretical relevance in complexity theory and cryptography. Moreover, results such as QIP = QIP(3) (STOC'00) show that quantum resources significantly help in such a task.
  In this work, we initiate the study of round compression of protocols in the bounded quantum storage model (BQSM). In this model, the malicious parties have a bounded quantum memory and they cannot store the all the qubits that are transmitted in the protocol.
  Our main results in this setting are the following:
  1. There is a non-interactive (statistical) witness indistinguishable proof for any language in NP (and even QMA) in BQSM in the plain model. We notice that in this protocol, only the memory of the verifier is bounded.
  2. Any classical proof system can be compressed in a two-message quantum proof system in BQSM. Moreover, if the original proof system is zero-knowledge, the quantum protocol is zero-knowledge too. In this result, we assume that the prover has bounded memory.
  Finally, we give evidence towards the "tightness" of our results. First, we show that NIZK in the plain model against BQS adversaries is unlikely with standard techniques. Second, we prove that without the BQS model there is no 2-message zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof, even under computational assumptions.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting Image-to-Image Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in various application scenarios. Since the production of a commercial GAN requires substantial computational and human resources, the copyright protection of GANs is urgently needed. This paper presents a novel fingerprinting scheme for the Intellectual Property (IP) protection of image-to-image GANs based on a trusted third party. We break through the stealthiness and robustness bottlenecks suffered by previous fingerprinting methods for classification models being naively transferred to GANs. Specifically, we innovatively construct a composite deep learning model from the target GAN and a classifier. Then we generate fingerprint samples from this composite model, and embed them in the classifier for effective ownership verification. This scheme inspires some concrete methodologies to practically protect the modern image-to-image translation GANs. Theoretical analysis proves that these methods can satisfy different security requirements necessary for IP protection. We also conduct extensive experiments to show that our solutions outperform existing strategies.</description>

Abstract: We study security-latency bounds for Nakamoto consensus, i.e., how secure a block is after it becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We improve the state-of-the-art bounds by analyzing the race between adversarial and honest chains in three different phases. We find the probability distribution of the growth of the adversarial chains under models similar to those in [Guo, Ren; AFT 2022] when a target block becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results. Combining all three phases provides novel upper and lower bounds for blockchains with small $\lambda\Delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of our critical infrastructure systems and personal computing systems have a distributed computing systems structure. The incentives to attack them have been growing rapidly as has their attack surface due to increasing levels of connectedness. Therefore, we feel it is time to bring in rigorous reasoning to secure such systems. The distributed system security and the game theory technical communities can come together to effectively address this challenge. In this article, we lay out the foundations from each that we can build upon to achieve our goals. Next, we describe a set of research challenges for the community, organized into three categories -- analytical, systems, and integration challenges, each with "short term" time horizon (2-3 years) and "long term" (5-10 years) items. This article was conceived of through a community discussion at the 2022 NSF SaTC PI meeting.</description>

      <title>Optimized Layerwise Approximation for Efficient Private Inference on Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored the deployment of privacy-preserving deep neural networks utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE), especially for private inference (PI). Many works have attempted the approximation-aware training (AAT) approach in PI, changing the activation functions of a model to low-degree polynomials that are easier to compute on HE by allowing model retraining. However, due to constraints in the training environment, it is often necessary to consider post-training approximation (PTA), using the pre-trained parameters of the existing plaintext model without retraining. Existing PTA studies have uniformly approximated the activation function in all layers to a high degree to mitigate accuracy loss from approximation, leading to significant time consumption. This study proposes an optimized layerwise approximation (OLA), a systematic framework that optimizes both accuracy loss and time consumption by using different approximation polynomials for each layer in the PTA scenario. For efficient approximation, we reflect the layerwise impact on the classification accuracy by considering the actual input distribution of each activation function while constructing the optimization problem. Additionally, we provide a dynamic programming technique to solve the optimization problem and achieve the optimized layerwise degrees in polynomial time. As a result, the OLA method reduces inference times for the ResNet-20 model and the ResNet-32 model by 3.02 times and 2.82 times, respectively, compared to prior state-of-the-art implementations employing uniform degree polynomials. Furthermore, we successfully classified CIFAR-10 by replacing the GELU function in the ConvNeXt model with only 3-degree polynomials using the proposed method, without modifying the backbone model.</description>

      <title>Activation Gradient based Poisoned Sample Detection Against Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the task of poisoned sample detection for defending against data poisoning based backdoor attacks. Its core challenge is finding a generalizable and discriminative metric to distinguish between clean and various types of poisoned samples (e.g., various triggers, various poisoning ratios). Inspired by a common phenomenon in backdoor attacks that the backdoored model tend to map significantly different poisoned and clean samples within the target class to similar activation areas, we introduce a novel perspective of the circular distribution of the gradients w.r.t. sample activation, dubbed gradient circular distribution (GCD). And, we find two interesting observations based on GCD. One is that the GCD of samples in the target class is much more dispersed than that in the clean class. The other is that in the GCD of target class, poisoned and clean samples are clearly separated. Inspired by above two observations, we develop an innovative three-stage poisoned sample detection approach, called Activation Gradient based Poisoned sample Detection (AGPD). First, we calculate GCDs of all classes from the model trained on the untrustworthy dataset. Then, we identify the target class(es) based on the difference on GCD dispersion between target and clean classes. Last, we filter out poisoned samples within the identified target class(es) based on the clear separation between poisoned and clean samples. Extensive experiments under various settings of backdoor attacks demonstrate the superior detection performance of the proposed method to existing poisoned detection approaches according to sample activation-based metrics.</description>

      <title>Instruction Backdoor Attacks Against Customized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for customized Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of solutions like GPTs. These solutions facilitate tailored LLM creation via natural language prompts without coding. However, the trustworthiness of third-party custom versions of LLMs remains an essential concern. In this paper, we propose the first instruction backdoor attacks against applications integrated with untrusted customized LLMs (e.g., GPTs). Specifically, these attacks embed the backdoor into the custom version of LLMs by designing prompts with backdoor instructions, outputting the attacker's desired result when inputs contain the pre-defined triggers. Our attack includes 3 levels of attacks: word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level, which adopt different types of triggers with progressive stealthiness. We stress that our attacks do not require fine-tuning or any modification to the backend LLMs, adhering strictly to GPTs development guidelines. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 prominent LLMs and 5 benchmark text classification datasets. The results show that our instruction backdoor attacks achieve the desired attack performance without compromising utility. Additionally, we propose two defense strategies and demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing such attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerability and the potential risks of LLM customization such as GPTs.</description>

      <title>Near-Term Enforcement of AI Chip Export Controls Using A Firmware-Based Design for Offline Licensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline Licensing is a mechanism for compute governance that could be used to prevent unregulated training of potentially dangerous frontier AI models. The mechanism works by disabling AI chips unless they have an unused license from a regulator. In this report, we present a design for a minimal version of Offline Licensing that could be delivered via a firmware update. Existing AI chips could potentially support Offline Licensing within a year if they have the following (relatively common) hardware security features: firmware verification, firmware rollback protection, and secure non-volatile memory. Public documentation suggests that NVIDIA's H100 AI chip already has these security features. Without additional hardware modifications, the system is susceptible to physical hardware attacks. However, these attacks might require expensive equipment and could be difficult to reliably apply to thousands of AI chips. A firmware-based Offline Licensing design shares the same legal requirements and license approval mechanism as a hardware-based solution. Implementing a firmware-based solution now could accelerate the eventual deployment of a more secure hardware-based solution in the future. For AI chip manufacturers, implementing this security mechanism might allow chips to be sold to customers that would otherwise be prohibited by export restrictions. For governments, it may be important to be able to prevent unsafe or malicious actors from training frontier AI models in the next few years. Based on this initial analysis, firmware-based Offline Licensing could partially solve urgent security and trade problems and is technically feasible for AI chips that have common hardware security features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the Brewer-Nash security policy model inspired by ethical Chinese Wall policies. We draw attention to the fact that write access can be revoked in the Brewer-Nash model. The semantics of write access were underspecified originally, leading to multiple interpretations for which we provide a modern operational semantics. We go on to modernise the analysis of information flow in the Brewer-Nash model, by adopting a more precise definition adapted from Kessler. For our modernised reformulation, we provide full mechanised coverage for all theorems proposed by Brewer &amp; Nash. Most theorems are established automatically using the tool {log} with the exception of a theorem regarding information flow, which combines a lemma in {log} with a theorem mechanised in Coq. Having covered all theorems originally posed by Brewer-Nash, achieving modern precision and mechanisation, we propose this work as a step towards a methodology for automated checking of more complex security policy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be a promising tool in detecting software vulnerabilities. In this work, we train neural networks with program slices extracted from the source code of C/C++ programs to detect software vulnerabilities. The program slices capture the syntax and semantic characteristics of vulnerability-related program constructs, including API function call, array usage, pointer usage, and arithmetic expression. To achieve a strong prediction model for both vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code, we compare different types of training data, different optimizers, and different types of neural networks. Our result shows that combining different types of characteristics of source code and using a balanced number of vulnerable program slices and non-vulnerable program slices produce a balanced accuracy in predicting both vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code. Among different neural networks, BGRU with the ADAM optimizer performs the best in detecting software vulnerabilities with an accuracy of 92.49%.</description>

      <title>S-Eval: Automatic and Adaptive Test Generation for Benchmarking Safety Evaluation of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models have gained considerable attention for their revolutionary capabilities. However, there is also growing concern on their safety implications, making a comprehensive safety evaluation for LLMs urgently needed before model deployment. In this work, we propose S-Eval, a new comprehensive, multi-dimensional and open-ended safety evaluation benchmark. At the core of S-Eval is a novel LLM-based automatic test prompt generation and selection framework, which trains an expert testing LLM Mt combined with a range of test selection strategies to automatically construct a high-quality test suite for the safety evaluation. The key to the automation of this process is a novel expert safety-critique LLM Mc able to quantify the riskiness score of an LLM's response, and additionally produce risk tags and explanations. Besides, the generation process is also guided by a carefully designed risk taxonomy with four different levels, covering comprehensive and multi-dimensional safety risks of concern. Based on these, we systematically construct a new and large-scale safety evaluation benchmark for LLMs consisting of 220,000 evaluation prompts, including 20,000 base risk prompts (10,000 in Chinese and 10,000 in English) and 200,000 corresponding attack prompts derived from 10 popular adversarial instruction attacks against LLMs. Moreover, considering the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanied safety threats, S-Eval can be flexibly configured and adapted to include new risks, attacks and models. S-Eval is extensively evaluated on 20 popular and representative LLMs. The results confirm that S-Eval can better reflect and inform the safety risks of LLMs compared to existing benchmarks. We also explore the impacts of parameter scales, language environments, and decoding parameters on the evaluation, providing a systematic methodology for evaluating the safety of LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between adversarial robustness and differential privacy in high-dimensional algorithmic statistics. We give the first black-box reduction from privacy to robustness which can produce private estimators with optimal tradeoffs among sample complexity, accuracy, and privacy for a wide range of fundamental high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, including mean and covariance estimation. We show that this reduction can be implemented in polynomial time in some important special cases. In particular, using nearly-optimal polynomial-time robust estimators for the mean and covariance of high-dimensional Gaussians which are based on the Sum-of-Squares method, we design the first polynomial-time private estimators for these problems with nearly-optimal samples-accuracy-privacy tradeoffs. Our algorithms are also robust to a nearly optimal fraction of adversarially-corrupted samples.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pufferfish Privacy: A Flexible Privacy Framework for Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a versatile privacy framework for quantum systems, termed quantum pufferfish privacy (QPP). Inspired by classical pufferfish privacy, our formulation generalizes and addresses limitations of quantum differential privacy by offering flexibility in specifying private information, feasible measurements, and domain knowledge. We show that QPP can be equivalently formulated in terms of the Datta-Leditzky information spectrum divergence, thus providing the first operational interpretation thereof. We reformulate this divergence as a semi-definite program and derive several properties of it, which are then used to prove convexity, composability, and post-processing of QPP mechanisms. Parameters that guarantee QPP of the depolarization mechanism are also derived. We analyze the privacy-utility tradeoff of general QPP mechanisms and, again, study the depolarization mechanism as an explicit instance. The QPP framework is then applied to privacy auditing for identifying privacy violations via a hypothesis testing pipeline that leverages quantum algorithms. Connections to quantum fairness and other quantum divergences are also explored and several variants of QPP are examined.</description>

      <title>Publicly-Detectable Watermarking for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a highly detectable, trustless watermarking scheme for LLMs: the detection algorithm contains no secret information, and it is executable by anyone. We embed a publicly-verifiable cryptographic signature into LLM output using rejection sampling. We prove that our scheme is cryptographically correct, sound, and distortion-free. We make novel uses of error-correction techniques to overcome periods of low entropy, a barrier for all prior watermarking schemes. We implement our scheme and make empirical measurements over open models in the 2.7B to 70B parameter range. Our experiments suggest that our formal claims are met in practice.</description>

      <title>The last Dance : Robust backdoor attack via diffusion models and bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05967</link>

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving UCB Decision Process Verification via zk-SNARKs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasingly widespread application of machine learning, how to strike a balance between protecting the privacy of data and algorithm parameters and ensuring the verifiability of machine learning has always been a challenge. This study explores the intersection of reinforcement learning and data privacy, specifically addressing the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. We introduce zkUCB, an innovative algorithm that employs the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to enhance UCB. zkUCB is carefully designed to safeguard the confidentiality of training data and algorithmic parameters, ensuring transparent UCB decision-making. Experiments highlight zkUCB's superior performance, attributing its enhanced reward to judicious quantization bit usage that reduces information entropy in the decision-making process. zkUCB's proof size and verification time scale linearly with the execution steps of zkUCB. This showcases zkUCB's adept balance between data security and operational efficiency. This approach contributes significantly to the ongoing discourse on reinforcing data privacy in complex decision-making processes, offering a promising solution for privacy-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>RICE: Breaking Through the Training Bottlenecks of Reinforcement Learning with Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is playing an increasingly important role in real-world applications. However, obtaining an optimally performing DRL agent for complex tasks, especially with sparse rewards, remains a significant challenge. The training of a DRL agent can be often trapped in a bottleneck without further progress. In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative refining scheme for reinforcement learning that incorporates explanation methods to break through the training bottlenecks. The high-level idea of RICE is to construct a new initial state distribution that combines both the default initial states and critical states identified through explanation methods, thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial states. Through careful design, we can theoretically guarantee that our refining scheme has a tighter sub-optimality bound. We evaluate RICE in various popular RL environments and real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RICE significantly outperforms existing refining schemes in enhancing agent performance.</description>

      <title>DP-DyLoRA: Fine-Tuning Transformer-Based Models On-Device under Differentially Private Federated Learning using Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows clients in an Internet of Things (IoT) system to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data with a server. However, clients' contributions to the server can still leak sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) addresses such leakage by providing formal privacy guarantees, with mechanisms that add randomness to the clients' contributions. The randomness makes it infeasible to train large transformer-based models, common in modern IoT systems. In this work, we empirically evaluate the practicality of fine-tuning large scale on-device transformer-based models with differential privacy in a federated learning system. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various system properties for tasks spanning a multitude of domains: speech recognition, computer vision (CV) and natural language understanding (NLU). Our results show that full fine-tuning under differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) generally leads to huge performance degradation which can be alleviated by reducing the dimensionality of contributions through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our benchmarks of existing DP-PEFT methods show that DP-Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) consistently outperforms other methods. An even more promising approach, DyLoRA, which makes the low rank variable, when naively combined with FL would straightforwardly break differential privacy. We therefore propose an adaptation method that can be combined with differential privacy and call it DP-DyLoRA. Finally, we are able to reduce the accuracy degradation and word error rate (WER) increase due to DP to less than 2% and 7% respectively with 1 million clients and a stringent privacy budget of {\epsilon}=2.</description>

      <title>Automatic Jailbreaking of the Text-to-Image Generative AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent AI systems have shown extremely powerful performance, even surpassing human performance, on various tasks such as information retrieval, language generation, and image generation based on large language models (LLMs). At the same time, there are diverse safety risks that can cause the generation of malicious contents by circumventing the alignment in LLMs, which are often referred to as jailbreaking. However, most of the previous works only focused on the text-based jailbreaking in LLMs, and the jailbreaking of the text-to-image (T2I) generation system has been relatively overlooked. In this paper, we first evaluate the safety of the commercial T2I generation systems, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini, on copyright infringement with naive prompts. From this empirical study, we find that Copilot and Gemini block only 12% and 17% of the attacks with naive prompts, respectively, while ChatGPT blocks 84% of them. Then, we further propose a stronger automated jailbreaking pipeline for T2I generation systems, which produces prompts that bypass their safety guards. Our automated jailbreaking framework leverages an LLM optimizer to generate prompts to maximize degree of violation from the generated images without any weight updates or gradient computation. Surprisingly, our simple yet effective approach successfully jailbreaks the ChatGPT with 11.0% block rate, making it generate copyrighted contents in 76% of the time. Finally, we explore various defense strategies, such as post-generation filtering and machine unlearning techniques, but found that they were inadequate, which suggests the necessity of stronger defense mechanisms.</description>
