      <description>arXiv:2602.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two new classes of sums with inverse binomial coefficients and harmonic numbers. In addition we establish recursive solutions to the following power sums \begin{equation*} U_d(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^{2k}}{\binom{2k}{k}} \cdot k^d \quad \mbox{and}\quad V_d(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^{2k}}{\binom{2k}{k}}\cdot k^d\,H_k, \end{equation*} where $d$ is a positive integer.</description>

      <title>Explicit conditional bounds for $\zeta(s)$ at the edge of the critical strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain explicit bounds for the real part of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta-function on the line $\re s=1$, assuming the Riemann hypothesis. The proof combines the Guinand--Weil explicit formula with extremal bandlimited majorants and minorants for the Poisson kernel. As an application, we revisit the classical estimates of Littlewood for the modulus of the Riemann zeta-function and of its reciprocal on the line $\re{s}=1$, and derive a slight refinement of the bounds of Lamzouri, Li, and Soundararajan. In addition, we establish an explicit bound for the modulus of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta-function on the line $\re{s}=1$ under the Riemann hypothesis, improving the lower-order term in a result of Chirre, Val{\aa}s, and Simoni\v{c}.</description>

      <title>Mean values and upper bounds for the Hurwitz and Barnes multiple zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their deep connection with the Riemann zeta function, the asymptotic behavior of mean values of multiple zeta functions has attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we establish asymptotic formulas and upper bounds for the mean square values of Hurwitz-type and Barnes-type multiple zeta functions. In particular, we focus on the Hurwitz-type case, since Hurwitz multiple zeta functions can be expressed as linear combinations of the classical Hurwitz zeta function, which allows us to apply known results on the mean values and asymptotic behavior of the latter almost directly. Moreover, it can be shown that Hurwitz-type and Barnes-type multiple zeta functions have the same order under certain conditions. This fact enables us to investigate the mean values and growth of Barnes multiple zeta functions, which are otherwise difficult to evaluate, by using the results for Hurwitz multiple zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Whittaker functions on ${{\rm GL}}_n$ via theta lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, two main approaches have been used to establish explicit formulas or propagation formulas for Whittaker functions over Archimedean local fields: one based on Jacquet integrals, and the other on the analysis of systems of partial differential equations. In this paper, we introduce a third approach via explicit theta correspondence. As an example, we derive new cases of explicit formulas for Whittaker functions on ${{\rm GL}}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and compute the associated Asai local zeta integrals.</description>

      <title>Division algorithms for norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields -- part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a Euclidean division algorithm for the real quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$ for $m \in \{2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 19\}$, with the property that the norm of the remainder depends on the first Euclidean minimum of the field. In each case, we cover the square $[-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]$ with hyperbolas and give a list of these, together with regions covered. We mechanize the proofs as much as we can, using exact computations, in order to be able to reproduce them.</description>

      <title>Geometric families of multiple elliptic Gamma functions and arithmetic applications, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series where we study arithmetic applications of the multiple elliptic Gamma functions originated in mathematical physics. In the first article in this series we defined geometric families of these functions and proved that these families satisfied coboundary relations involving an attached collection of Bernoulli rational functions. The main purpose of the present paper is to show that smoothed versions of our geometric elliptic Gamma functions give rise to partial modular symbols for congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_{n}(\mathbb{Z})$ for $n \geq 2$ which restrict to $(n-2)$-cocycles on tori in $\mathrm{SL}_{n}(\mathbb{Z})$ coming from groups of totally positive units in number fields. To achieve this, we show that the associated smoothed Bernoulli rational functions reduce to smoothed higher Dedekind sums with uniformly bounded denominators.</description>

      <title>Une formule des traces pour les espaces sym\'etriques. Le cas de Guo-Jacquet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of Arthur's trace formula, we establish a general trace formula for symmetric spaces associated with the variety of involutions of a finite $D$-module where $D$ is a division algebra central over a number field $F$. Such a formula should be useful for studying the automorphic spectrum of these symmetric spaces and the deep links between linear periods and special values of standard $L$-functions at their center of symmetry. Indeed, our formula yields an identity between spectral distributions, which generalize relative characters built on linear periods, and geometric distributions, which are an extension of relative orbital integrals. We show that the spectral distributions are, in a certain sense, asymptotic to truncated integrals of the components of the automorphic kernel associated with a cuspidal datum: this provides a handle on these distributions and has allowed, in a companion paper, to express some of these distributions in the form of a weighted relative character. The geometric distributions attached to "regular semi-simple" geometric data are expressed as weighted relative orbital integrals. In general, for non-regular geometric data, we introduce a procedure of descent to the centralizer, which allows us to express any geometric distribution in terms of the nilpotent contribution of infinitesimal trace formulas studied in previous papers.</description>

      <title>Prime ideal divisors of parametric recurrence sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new arithmetic results for parametric linear recurrence sequences specialized at roots of unity, denoted by $(U_n(\zeta))_{n\geq 0}$. In particular, we obtain exponential lower bounds for the largest prime ideal divisor and norm of the radical of the principal ideal generated by $U_n(\zeta)$. We further derive an effective upper bound for the $S$-part of $U_n(\zeta)$, showing that it is strictly smaller than a fixed power of its absolute norm for sufficiently large $n$. Finally, we establish an effective finiteness result for Diophantine equations of the form $U_n(\zeta)=w_1+\cdots+w_r,$ with $S$-unit variables.</description>

      <title>Automorphic Cohomology and the Limits of Algebraic Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an explicit obstruction to constructing algebraic cycles from automorphic cohomology classes on Shimura varieties. We produce a rational Hodge class $\Omega_E$ in the intersection cohomology of the Baily-Borel compactification of a Shimura variety for $\text{SO}(2,26)$, arising from a stable residual automorphic representation via theta lift from the weight-$2$ newform of conductor $11$. While $\Omega_E$ is automorphic and of pure Hodge type, we prove it is non-interior and hence cannot be obtained from special cycles, theta lifts, endoscopic transfers, or boundary pushforwards, all of which yield interior classes. The result is unconditional, relying only on Arthur's classification, Vogan-Zuckerman theory, the fundamental lemma, and the Zucker conjecture (proven by Looijenga-Saper-Stern), and it highlights a fundamental asymmetry between automorphic cohomology and geometric access to algebraic cycles, refining the Hodge conjecture from a question of existence to one of constructive tractability.</description>

      <title>Inverse Falconer Distance Theorems over the Integer Residue Rings $\mathbb{Z}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an ideal-theoretic rigidity principle for quadratic distance images over integer residue rings. Specifically, we prove that near-extremal collapse of the distance set in $\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ forces strong algebraic structure supported on annihilator submodules arising from the arithmetic of $n$.
  As a consequence, we obtain the first inverse theorem for the Falconer distance problem over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for composite moduli. We show that if a set $E \subset \mathbb{Z}_n^d$ of size $|E| \asymp n^{(d+1)/2}$ determines only $O(n)$ distinct squared distances, then $E$ must be supported on a coset of an annihilator submodule on which the distance form is algebraically degenerate.
  The proof introduces a divisor-depth decomposition intrinsic to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, together with a lifting mechanism that transfers local degeneracies at prime moduli into global ideal-theoretic constraints. This yields a complete classification of near-extremizers for the Falconer distance problem in the ring setting, revealing a rigidity phenomenon with no analogue over fields.</description>

      <title>Explicit composition identities for higher composition laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2001, Bhargava proved a composition law for $2 \times 2 \times 2$ integer cubes, which generalized Gauss composition of integral binary quadratic forms. Furthermore, he derived four new composition laws defined on the following spaces: 1) binary cubic forms with triplicate middle coefficients, 2) pairs of binary quadratic forms with duplicate middle coefficients, 3) pairs of quaternary alternating 2-forms and 4) senary alternating 3-forms. In each of the five cases, there is a natural group action on the underlying space with a unique polynomial invariant called the discriminant, and a notion of projectivity for the elements of the space. The strategy behind Bhargava's approach is to construct a discriminant-preserving bijection between the set of orbits under the group action and the set of (tuples of) suitable ideal classes of quadratic rings. The projective ideal classes are equipped with a natural group structure and hence we get a group structure on the spaces of equivalence classes of projective forms of fixed discriminant $D$. In each case the class group of projective forms of discriminant $D$ has a natural interpretation in terms of the narrow class group of the quadratic ring of discriminant $D$. The aim of this paper is to give explicit composition identities (similar to Gauss' formulation of composition of binary quadratic forms) for these higher composition laws.</description>

      <title>Counting number fields of fixed degree by their smallest defining polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When do two irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients
  define the same number field? One can define an action of
  $\mathrm{GL}_2 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ on the space of polynomials of degree $n$ so that for any two
  polynomials $f$ and $g$ in the same orbit, the roots of $f$ may be expressed
  as rational linear transformations of the roots of $g$; thus, they generate
  the same field. In this article, we show that almost all polynomials of
  degree $n$ with size at most $X$ can only define the same number field as
  another polynomial of degree $n$ with size at most $X$ if they lie in the
  same orbit for this group action. (Here we measure the size of polynomials by
  the greatest absolute value of their coefficients.)
  This improves on work of Bhargava, Shankar, and Wang, who proved a similar
  statement for a positive proportion of polynomials. Using this result, we
  prove that the number of degree $n$ fields such that the smallest polynomial
  defining the field has size at most $X$ is asymptotic to a constant times
  $X^{n+1}$ as long as $n\geq 3$. For $n = 2$, we obtain a precise asymptotic of
  the form $\frac{27}{\pi^2} X^2$.</description>

      <title>Towards Lang--Vojta via Degeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards the Lang--Vojta conjecture, we prove results on finiteness and Zariski degeneracy of $S$-integral points of varieties over number fields $k$, including many cases with geometrically irreducible boundary divisors. Our approach builds on the study of arithmetic and geometric properties of moduli spaces of curves with extra structure. As an application, we provide families of explicit examples of geometrically irreducible divisors on the projective plane (such as the dual of any smooth curve of degree at least $3$), with respect to which the sets of $S$-integral points are finite. Answering a question of Achenjang and Morrow, we show that, other than the case of curves, every normal projective variety admits a geometrically irreducible divisor $D$ for which finiteness of $(D,S)$-integral points holds over every finite extension of $k$.</description>

Abstract: The integer convex hull $I(H_N)$ of the set $H_N=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: xy\ge N\}$ is the convex hull of the lattice points in $H_N$. The vertices of $I(H_N)$ lie in the square $[1,N]^2$. Improving on a recent result of Alc\'antara et al. ~\cite{Santos} we show that the number of vertices of $I(H_N)$ is of order $N^{1/3}\log N$. We also show that the area of the part of $H_N \setminus I(H_N)$ that lies in the square $[1,N^{2/3}]^2$ is also of order $N^{1/3}\log N$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a conjecture of Ginzburg and Soudry on an integral representation for the $L$-function $L^S(s, \pi\times \tau)$ attached to a pair $(\pi, \tau)$ of irreducible automorphic cuspidal representations of $\mathrm{Sp}_4({\mathbb A})$ and $\mathrm{GL}_2({\mathbb A})$, which is derived from the generalized doubling method of Cai, Friedberg, Ginzburg and Kaplan. We show that the integral unfolds to a non-unique model and analyze it using the New Way method of Piatetski-Shapiro and Rallis. Two applications are given. First, we relate the existence of the poles of $L^S(s,\pi\times\tau)$ to the non-vanishing of certain period integrals. Second, for certain family of cuspidal representations, we prove that $L^S(s, \pi\times \tau)$ is holomorphic.</description>

      <title>Bianchi period polynomials: Hecke action and congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Bianchi group associated to one of the five Euclidean imaginary quadratic fields. We show that the space of weight $k$ period polynomials for $\Gamma$ is ``dual'' to the space of weight $k$ modular symbols for $\Gamma$, reflecting the duality between the first and second cohomology groups of Bianchi groups. Using this result, we describe the action of Hecke operators on the space of period polynomials for $\Gamma$ via the Heilbronn matrices.
  In the second part of the paper, we numerically investigate congruences between level 1 Bianchi eigenforms via computer programs which implement the Hecke action on spaces of Bianchi period polynomials. Computations with the Hecke action are used to indicate moduli of congruences between the underlying Bianchi forms; we then prove the congruences using the period polynomials. From this we find congruences between genuine Bianchi modular forms and both a base-change Bianchi form and an Eisenstein series. We believe these congruences are the first of their kind in the literature.</description>

      <title>Relative Langlands Duality of Toric Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relative Langlands program introduced by Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh posits a duality structure exchanging automorphic periods and L-functions, which can be encoded by pairs of dual Hamiltonian actions. In work of the author and Venkatesh, an extension of the definitions to certain singular spaces was made with the objective of restoring duality in some well-known automorphic integrals. In this companion article we apply these definitions to establish duality in the context of affine toric varieties, and study finer structures regarding regularization and stabilizers that are instructive for the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shintani's celebrated invariants are conjectured to generate abelian extensions of real quadratic number fields, offering a potential solution to Hilbert's 12th problem in that setting. In this note, we derive new expressions for Shintani's invariants by generalizing an observation of Yamamoto, who showed that these invariants - originally formulated using the double sine function - can be expressed in terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol.</description>

      <title>On the Real Zeroes of Half-integral Weight Hecke Cusp Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the distribution of zeroes of half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms on the manifold $\Gamma_0(4)\backslash\mathbb H$ near a cusp at infinity. In analogue of the Ghosh-Sarnak conjecture for classical holomorphic Hecke cusp forms, one expects that almost all of the zeroes sufficiently close to this cusp lie on two vertical geodesics $\Re(s)=-1/2$ and $\Re(s)=0$ as the weight tends to infinity. We show that, for $\gg_\varepsilon K^2/(\log K)^{3/2+\varepsilon}$ of the half-integral weight Hecke cusp forms in the Kohnen plus subspaces with weight bounded by a large constant $K$, the number of such "real" zeroes grows almost at the expected rate. We also obtain a weaker lower bound for the number of real zeroes that holds for a positive proportion of forms. One of the key ingredients is the asymptotic evaluation of averaged first and second moments of quadratic twists of modular $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>On Lenstra's criterion for norm-Euclideanity of number fields and properties of Dedekind zeta-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977, Lenstra provided a criterion for norm-Euclideanity of number fields and noted that this criterion becomes ineffective for number fields of large enough degrees under the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for the Dedekind zeta-functions. In the first part of the paper we make Lenstra's observation explicit by proving that, under GRH, the criterion becomes ineffective for all number fields of degree $n \geq 62238$. This follows from combining the criterion assumption with the explicit lower bound for the discriminant of $K$ under GRH, and the (trivial) upper bound for the minimal proper ideal norm in $\mathcal{O}_K$.
  Unconditionally, the lower bound for the discriminant is too weak to lead to such a contradiction. However, we show that GRH can be replaced by another condition on the Dedekind zeta functions $\zeta_K$, a conjectural lower bound for $\zeta_K$ at a point to the right of $s = 1$. Combined with Zimmert's approach, this condition implies a different type of upper bound for the minimal proper ideal norm and again contradicts Lenstra's criterion for all $n$ large enough. The advantage of the new potential condition on $\zeta_K$ is that it can be computationally checked for number fields of not too large degrees.</description>

      <title>Diophantine tuples and product sets in shifted powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k\geq 2$ and $n\neq 0$. A Diophantine tuple with property $D_k(n)$ is a set of positive integers $A$ such that $ab+n$ is a $k$-th power for all $a,b\in A$ with $a\neq b$. Such generalizations of classical Diophantine tuples have been studied extensively. In this paper, we prove several results related to robust versions of such Diophantine tuples and discuss their applications to product sets contained in a nontrivial shift of the set of all perfect powers or some of its special subsets. In particular, we substantially improve several results by B\'{e}rczes--Dujella--Hajdu--Luca, and Yip. We also prove several interesting conditional results. Our proofs are based on a novel combination of ideas from sieve methods, Diophantine approximation, and extremal graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study modular forms for $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ with no negative Fourier coefficients. Let $A(k)$ be the positive integer where if the first $A(k)$ Fourier coefficients of a modular form of weight $k$ for $\textrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ are nonnegative, then all of its Fourier coefficients are nonnegative, so that $A(k)$ can be interpreted as a ``nonnegativity Sturm bound''. We give upper and lower bounds for $A(k)$, as well as an upper bound on the $n$th Fourier coefficient of any form with no negative Fourier coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(x,y)$ denote the count of $y$-smooth numbers below $x$ and $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. We prove that for $f$ a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, the partial sums over $y$-smooth numbers always enjoy better than squareroot cancellation, in the sense that $$ \mathbb{E} \Big|\sum_{\substack{1\leq n \leq x\\ P(n) \leq y}} f(n) \Big| = o\left( \Psi(x,y)^{1/2} \right),$$ uniformly on the entire range $ 2 \leq y \leq x$. The bounds are quantitative and give a large saving when $y$ isn't too close to $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we start by defining a covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and prove some of its properties. Then, for genuine representations of $p$-adic covering groups we formulate an upper bound conjecture for their wavefront sets using this covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and reduce it to anti-discrete representations. The formulation generalizes that of Ciubotaru-Kim and Hazeltine-Liu-Lo-Shahidi for linear algebraic groups. We prove this upper bound conjecture for Kazhdan-Patterson coverings of general linear groups.</description>

      <title>Dead ends in square-free digit walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study "dead ends" in square-free digit walks: square-free integers $N$ such that, in base $b$, every one-digit extension $bN+d$ is non-square-free. In base $10$, the stochastic independence model of Miller et al. suggests that infinite square-free walks occur with probability near $1$, corresponding to an asymptotic dead-end density of $\approx 5.218\times 10^{-5}$. We prove that the true asymptotic dead-end density satisfies \[ c_{\mathrm{dead}} \approx 1.317\times 10^{-9}, \] roughly a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^4$ smaller than the prediction. For every base $b\geq 2$, we prove that dead-end densities exist and are given by a closed-form expression (as a finite alternating sum of Euler products). The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the problem.</description>
