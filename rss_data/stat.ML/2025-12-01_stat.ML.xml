      <title>Sparse Multiple Kernel Learning: Alternating Best Response and Semidefinite Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Sparse Multiple Kernel Learning (SMKL), which is the problem of selecting a sparse convex combination of prespecified kernels for support vector binary classification. Unlike prevailing l1 regularized approaches that approximate a sparsifying penalty, we formulate the problem by imposing an explicit cardinality constraint on the kernel weights and add an l2 penalty for robustness. We solve the resulting non-convex minimax problem via an alternating best response algorithm with two subproblems: the alpha subproblem is a standard kernel SVM dual solved via LIBSVM, while the beta subproblem admits an efficient solution via the Greedy Selector and Simplex Projector algorithm. We reformulate SMKL as a mixed integer semidefinite optimization problem and derive a hierarchy of semidefinite convex relaxations which can be used to certify near-optimality of the solutions returned by our best response algorithm and also to warm start it. On ten UCI benchmarks, our method with random initialization outperforms state-of-the-art MKL approaches in out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 3.34 percentage points (relative to the best performing benchmark) while selecting a small number of candidate kernels in comparable runtime. With warm starting, our method outperforms the best performing benchmark's out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 4.05 percentage points. Our convex relaxations provide a certificate that in several cases, the solution returned by our best response algorithm is the globally optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Scientific Software for Quasi-Monte Carlo, Fast Gaussian Process Regression, and Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most scientific domains elicit the development of efficient algorithms and accessible scientific software. This thesis unifies our developments in three broad domains: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for efficient high-dimensional integration, Gaussian process (GP) regression for high-dimensional interpolation with built-in uncertainty quantification, and scientific machine learning (sciML) for modeling partial differential equations (PDEs) with mesh-free solvers. For QMC, we built new algorithms for vectorized error estimation and developed QMCPy (https://qmcsoftware.github.io/QMCSoftware/): an open-source Python interface to randomized low-discrepancy sequence generators, automatic variable transforms, adaptive error estimation procedures, and diverse use cases. For GPs, we derived new digitally-shift-invariant kernels of higher-order smoothness, developed novel fast multitask GP algorithms, and produced the scalable Python software FastGPs (https://alegresor.github.io/fastgps/). For sciML, we developed a new algorithm capable of machine precision recovery of PDEs with random coefficients. We have also studied a number of applications including GPs for probability of failure estimation, multilevel GPs for the Darcy flow equation, neural surrogates for modeling radiative transfer, and fast GPs for Bayesian multilevel QMC.</description>

      <title>A Sensitivity Approach to Causal Inference Under Limited Overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited overlap between treated and control groups is a key challenge in observational analysis. Standard approaches like trimming importance weights can reduce variance but introduce a fundamental bias. We propose a sensitivity framework for contextualizing findings under limited overlap, where we assess how irregular the outcome function has to be in order for the main finding to be invalidated. Our approach is based on worst-case confidence bounds on the bias introduced by standard trimming practices, under explicit assumptions necessary to extrapolate counterfactual estimates from regions of overlap to those without. Empirically, we demonstrate how our sensitivity framework protects against spurious findings by quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited overlap.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Regularization on Nonparametric Mean-Variance Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is vital for decision-making and risk assessment in machine learning. Mean-variance regression models, which predict both a mean and residual noise for each data point, provide a simple approach to uncertainty quantification. However, overparameterized mean-variance models struggle with signal-to-noise ambiguity, deciding whether prediction targets should be attributed to signal (mean) or noise (variance). At one extreme, models fit all training targets perfectly with zero residual noise, while at the other, they provide constant, uninformative predictions and explain the targets as noise. We observe a sharp phase transition between these extremes, driven by model regularization. Empirical studies with varying regularization levels illustrate this transition, revealing substantial variability across repeated runs. To explain this behavior, we develop a statistical field theory framework, which captures the observed phase transition in alignment with experimental results. This analysis reduces the regularization hyperparameter search space from two dimensions to one, significantly lowering computational costs. Experiments on UCI datasets and the large-scale ClimSim dataset demonstrate robust calibration performance, effectively quantifying predictive uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Support Vector Machine Classifier with Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Support vector machines are widely used in machine learning classification tasks, but traditional SVM models suffer from sensitivity to outliers and instability in resampling, which limits their performance in practical applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel rescaled Huberized pinball loss function with asymmetric, non-convex, and smooth properties. Based on this loss function, we develop a corresponding SVM model called RHPSVM (Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss Support Vector Machine). Theoretical analyses demonstrate that RHPSVM conforms to Bayesian rules, has a strict generalization error bound, a bounded influence function, and controllable optimality conditions, ensuring excellent classification accuracy, outlier insensitivity, and resampling stability. Additionally, RHPSVM can be extended to various advanced SVM variants by adjusting parameters, enhancing its flexibility. We transform the non-convex optimization problem of RHPSVM into a series of convex subproblems using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and solve it with the ClipDCD algorithm, which is proven to be convergent. Experimental results on simulated data, UCI datasets, and small-sample crop leaf image classification tasks show that RHPSVM outperforms existing SVM models in both noisy and noise-free scenarios, especially in handling high-dimensional small-sample data.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Generalization in DP-GD: A Case Study in Training Two-Layer CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep learning techniques focus on extracting intricate information from data to achieve accurate predictions. However, the training datasets may be crowdsourced and include sensitive information, such as personal contact details, financial data, and medical records. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on developing privacy-preserving training algorithms for neural networks that maintain good performance while preserving privacy. In this paper, we investigate the generalization and privacy performances of the differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) algorithm, which is a private variant of the gradient descent (GD) by incorporating additional noise into the gradients during each iteration. Moreover, we identify a concrete learning task where DP-GD can achieve superior generalization performance compared to GD in training two-layer Huberized ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, a small signal-to-noise ratio can result in GD producing training models with poor test accuracy, whereas DP-GD can yield training models with good test accuracy and privacy guarantees if the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small. This indicates that DP-GD has the potential to enhance model performance while ensuring privacy protection in certain learning tasks. Numerical simulations are further conducted to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>UCB for Large-Scale Pure Exploration: Beyond Sub-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting the best alternative from a finite set represents a broad class of pure exploration problems. Traditional approaches to pure exploration have predominantly relied on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions on the performance distributions of all alternatives, which limit their applicability to non-sub-Gaussian especially heavy-tailed problems. The need to move beyond sub-Gaussianity may become even more critical in large-scale problems, which tend to be especially sensitive to distributional specifications. In this paper, motivated by the widespread use of upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms in pure exploration and beyond, we investigate their performance in the large-scale, non-sub-Gaussian settings. We consider the simplest category of UCB algorithms, where the UCB value for each alternative is defined as the sample mean plus an exploration bonus that depends only on its own sample size. We abstract this into a meta-UCB algorithm and propose letting it select the alternative with the largest sample size as the best upon stopping. For this meta-UCB algorithm, we first derive a distribution-free lower bound on the probability of correct selection. Building on this bound, we analyze two general non-sub-Gaussian scenarios: (1) all alternatives follow a common location-scale structure and have bounded variance; and (2) when such a structure does not hold, each alternative has a bounded absolute moment of order $q &gt; 3$. In both settings, we show that the meta-UCB algorithm and therefore a broad class of UCB algorithms can achieve the sample optimality. These results demonstrate the applicability of UCB algorithms for solving large-scale pure exploration problems with non-sub-Gaussian distributions. Numerical experiments support our results and provide additional insights into the comparative behaviors of UCB algorithms within and beyond our meta-UCB framework.</description>

      <title>Data-driven informative priors for Bayesian inference with quasi-periodic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian computational strategies for inference can be inefficient in approximating the posterior distribution in models that exhibit some form of periodicity. This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback. Finally, we analyzed its impact on the marginal posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>A PLS-Integrated LASSO Method with Application in Index Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional multivariate data analysis, dimension reduction and regression have been treated as distinct endeavors. Established techniques such as principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS) regression traditionally compute latent components as intermediary steps -- although with different underlying criteria -- before proceeding with the regression analysis. In this paper, we introduce an innovative regression methodology named PLS-integrated Lasso (PLS-Lasso) that integrates the concept of dimension reduction directly into the regression process. We present two distinct formulations for PLS-Lasso, denoted as PLS-Lasso-v1 and PLS-Lasso-v2, along with clear and effective algorithms that ensure convergence to global optima. PLS-Lasso-v1 and PLS-Lasso-v2 are compared with Lasso on the task of financial index tracking and show promising results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Theory and Phase Transitions for Variable Importance in Quantile Regression Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) are widely used for non-parametric conditional quantile estimation, yet statistical inference for variable importance measures remains challenging due to the non-smoothness of the loss function and the complex bias-variance trade-off. In this paper, we develop a asymptotic theory for variable importance defined as the difference in pinball loss risks. We first establish the asymptotic normality of the QRF estimator by handling the non-differentiable pinball loss via Knight's identity. Second, we uncover a "phase transition" phenomenon governed by the subsampling rate $\beta$ (where $s \asymp n^{\beta}$). We prove that in the bias-dominated regime ($\beta \ge 1/2$), which corresponds to large subsample sizes typically favored in practice to maximize predictive accuracy, standard inference breaks down as the estimator converges to a deterministic bias constant rather than a zero-mean normal distribution. Finally, we derive the explicit analytic form of this asymptotic bias and discuss the theoretical feasibility of restoring valid inference via analytic bias correction. Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between predictive performance and inferential validity, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the intrinsic limitations of random forest inference in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>OBLR-PO: A Theoretical Framework for Stable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training methods for large language models have advanced rapidly, yet their design has largely been guided by heuristics rather than systematic theoretical principles. This gap limits our understanding of the properties of the gradient estimators and the associated optimization algorithms, thereby constraining opportunities to improve training stability and overall performance. In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework that characterizes the statistical properties of commonly used policy-gradient estimators under mild assumptions. Our analysis establishes unbiasedness, derives exact variance expressions, and yields an optimization-loss upper bound that enables principled reasoning about learning dynamics. Building on these results, we prove convergence guarantees and derive an adaptive learning-rate schedule governed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gradients. We further show that the variance-optimal baseline is a gradient-weighted estimator, offering a new principle for variance reduction and naturally enhancing stability beyond existing methods. These insights motivate Optimal Baseline and Learning-Rate Policy Optimization (OBLR-PO), an algorithm that jointly adapts learning rates and baselines in a theoretically grounded manner. Experiments on Qwen3-4B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base demonstrate consistent gains over existing policy optimization methods, validating that our theoretical contributions translate into practical improvements in large-scale post-training.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Geometric Method for Capturing Relational Topic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretable topic modeling is essential for tracking how research interests evolve within co-author communities. In scientific corpora, where novelty is prized, identifying underrepresented niche topics is particularly important. However, contemporary models built from dense transformer embeddings tend to miss rare topics and therefore also fail to capture smooth temporal alignment. We propose a geometric method that integrates multimodal text and co-author network data, using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram. This approach captures both local and global structure, supporting multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions. Our method effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time. Experiments highlight the strength of interpretable bag-of-words models when paired with principled geometric alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research increasingly relies on computational methods to analyze experimental data and predict molecular properties. Current approaches often require researchers to use a variety of tools for statistical analysis and machine learning, creating workflow inefficiencies. We present an integrated platform that combines classical statistical methods with Random Forest classification for comprehensive data analysis that can be used in the biological sciences. The platform implements automated hyperparameter optimization, feature importance analysis, and a suite of statistical tests including t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation analysis. Our methodology addresses the gap between traditional statistical software, modern machine learning frameworks and biology, by providing a unified interface accessible to researchers without extensive programming experience. The system achieves this through automatic data preprocessing, categorical encoding, and adaptive model configuration based on dataset characteristics. Initial testing protocols are designed to evaluate classification accuracy across diverse chemical datasets with varying feature distributions. This work demonstrates that integrating statistical rigor with machine learning interpretability can accelerate biological discovery workflows while maintaining methodological soundness. The platform's modular architecture enables future extensions to additional machine learning algorithms and statistical procedures relevant to bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.</description>

      <title>Representative Action Selection for Large Action Space: From Bandits to MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a small, representative action subset from an extremely large action space shared across a family of reinforcement learning (RL) environments -- a fundamental challenge in applications like inventory management and recommendation systems, where direct learning over the entire space is intractable. Our goal is to identify a fixed subset of actions that, for every environment in the family, contains a near-optimal action, thereby enabling efficient learning without exhaustively evaluating all actions.
  This work extends our prior results for meta-bandits to the more general setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that our existing algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. This theoretical guarantee is established under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, which accommodates greater environmental heterogeneity. Consequently, our approach provides a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Digital Twin for Misspecified Structural Dynamical Systems via Latent Force Modeling and Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a probabilistic digital twin framework for response prediction in dynamical systems governed by misspecified physics. The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification.</description>

      <title>What Is the Optimal Ranking Score Between Precision and Recall? We Can Always Find It and It Is Rarely $F_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking methods or models based on their performance is of prime importance but is tricky because performance is fundamentally multidimensional. In the case of classification, precision and recall are scores with probabilistic interpretations that are both important to consider and complementary. The rankings induced by these two scores are often in partial contradiction. In practice, therefore, it is extremely useful to establish a compromise between the two views to obtain a single, global ranking. Over the last fifty years or so,it has been proposed to take a weighted harmonic mean, known as the F-score, F-measure, or $F_\beta$. Generally speaking, by averaging basic scores, we obtain a score that is intermediate in terms of values. However, there is no guarantee that these scores lead to meaningful rankings and no guarantee that the rankings are good tradeoffs between these base scores. Given the ubiquity of $F_\beta$ scores in the literature, some clarification is in order. Concretely: (1) We establish that $F_\beta$-induced rankings are meaningful and define a shortest path between precision- and recall-induced rankings. (2) We frame the problem of finding a tradeoff between two scores as an optimization problem expressed with Kendall rank correlations. We show that $F_1$ and its skew-insensitive version are far from being optimal in that regard. (3) We provide theoretical tools and a closed-form expression to find the optimal value for $\beta$ for any distribution or set of performances, and we illustrate their use on six case studies.</description>

      <title>A Trainable Centrality Framework for Modern Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring how central or typical a data point is underpins robust estimation, ranking, and outlier detection, but classical depth notions become expensive and unstable in high dimensions and are hard to extend beyond Euclidean data. We introduce Fused Unified centrality Score Estimation (FUSE), a neural centrality framework that operates on top of arbitrary representations. FUSE combines a global head, trained from pairwise distance-based comparisons to learn an anchor-free centrality score, with a local head, trained by denoising score matching to approximate a smoothed log-density potential. A single parameter between 0 and 1 interpolates between these calibrated signals, yielding depth-like centrality from different views via one forward pass. Across synthetic distributions, real images, time series, and text data, and standard outlier detection benchmarks, FUSE recovers meaningful classical ordering, reveals multi-scale geometric structures, and attains competitive performance with strong classical baselines while remaining simple and efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a "Ridge of Optimization" characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to "Spectral Concentration," its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the "Edge of Stability," a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Strategies to Minimize Out-of-Distribution Effects in Data-Driven MRS Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study systematically compared data-driven and model-based strategies for metabolite quantification in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), focusing on resilience to out-of-distribution (OoD) effects and the balance between accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. A neural network designed for MRS quantification was trained using three distinct strategies: supervised regression, self-supervised learning, and test-time adaptation. These were compared against model-based fitting tools. Experiments combined large-scale simulated data, designed to probe metabolite concentration extrapolation and signal variability, with 1H single-voxel 7T in-vivo human brain spectra. In simulations, supervised learning achieved high accuracy for spectra similar to those in the training distribution, but showed marked degradation when extrapolated beyond the training distribution. Test-time adaptation proved more resilient to OoD effects, while self-supervised learning achieved intermediate performance. In-vivo experiments showed larger variance across the methods (data-driven and model-based) due to domain shift. Across all strategies, overlapping metabolites and baseline variability remained persistent challenges. While strong performance can be achieved by data-driven methods for MRS metabolite quantification, their reliability is contingent on careful consideration of the training distribution and potential OoD effects. When such conditions in the target distribution cannot be anticipated, test-time adaptation strategies ensure consistency between the quantification, the data, and the model, enabling reliable data-driven MRS pipelines.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Transformers in Learning Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across various applications, especially in handling sequential data such as natural languages and time series. However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Quantized-Tinyllava: a new multimodal foundation model enables efficient split learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split learning is well known as a method for resolving data privacy concerns by training a model on distributed devices, thereby avoiding data sharing that raises privacy issues. However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we present a new multimodal model structure that incorporates a learning-based data compression method, which compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving the model's performance, greatly reducing the transmission costs between partitions. We then determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels based on a solid theoretical foundation from entropy coding.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Execution of Bayesian Neural Networks using a Single Probabilistic Forward Pass and Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefits of Sinusoidal Activation for Modular Addition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the role of activation functions in learning modular addition with two-layer neural networks. We first establish a sharp expressivity gap: sine MLPs admit width-$2$ exact realizations for any fixed length $m$ and, with bias, width-$2$ exact realizations uniformly over all lengths. In contrast, the width of ReLU networks must scale linearly with $m$ to interpolate, and they cannot simultaneously fit two lengths with different residues modulo $p$. We then provide a novel Natarajan-dimension generalization bound for sine networks, yielding nearly optimal sample complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(p)$ for ERM over constant-width sine networks. We also derive width-independent, margin-based generalization for sine networks in the overparametrized regime and validate it. Empirically, sine networks generalize consistently better than ReLU networks across regimes and exhibit strong length extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Improved Generalization Bounds for Transductive Learning by Transductive Local Complexity and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Transductive Local Complexity (TLC) as a new tool for analyzing the generalization performance of transductive learning methods. Our work extends the classical Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC) to the transductive setting, incorporating substantial and novel components beyond standard inductive LRC analysis. Although LRC has been used to obtain sharp generalization bounds and minimax rates for inductive tasks such as classification and nonparametric regression, it has remained an open problem whether a localized Rademacher complexity framework can be effectively adapted to transductive learning to achieve sharp or nearly sharp bounds consistent with inductive results. We provide an affirmative answer via TLC. TLC is constructed by first deriving a new concentration inequality in Theorem 4.1 for the supremum of empirical processes capturing the gap between test and training losses, termed the test-train process, under uniform sampling without replacement, which leverages a novel combinatorial property of the test-train process and a new proof strategy applying the exponential Efron-Stein inequality twice. A subsequent peeling strategy and a new surrogate variance operator then yield excess risk bounds in the transductive setting that are nearly consistent with classical LRC-based inductive bounds up to a logarithmic gap. We further advance transductive learning through two applications: (1) for realizable transductive learning over binary-valued classes with finite VC dimension and $u \ge m \ge \dVC$ where $u$ and $m$ are the number of test features and training features, our Theorem 6.1 gives a nearly optimal bound $\Theta(\dVC \log(me/\dVC)/m)$ matching the minimax rate $\Theta(\dVC/m)$ up to $\log m$, resolving a decade-old open question; and (2) Theorem 6.3 presents a sharper excess risk bound for transductive kernel learning compared to the current state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing neural network dynamics via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucial to building theoretical foundations for deep learning. Previous work has analyzed structured inputs within the \textit{hidden manifold model}, often under the simplifying assumption of a Gaussian distribution. We extend this framework by modeling inputs as Gaussian mixtures to better represent complex, real-world data. Through empirical and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that with proper standardization, the learning dynamics converges to the behavior seen in the simple Gaussian case. This finding exhibits a form of universality, where diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, thereby strengthening the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a non-parametric technique for constructing prediction intervals or sets from arbitrary predictive models under the assumption that the data is exchangeable. It is popular as it comes with theoretical guarantees on the marginal coverage of the prediction sets and the split conformal prediction variant has a very low computational cost compared to model training. We study the robustness of split conformal prediction in a data contamination setting, where we assume a small fraction of the calibration scores are drawn from a different distribution than the bulk. We quantify the impact of the corrupted data on the coverage and efficiency of the constructed sets when evaluated on "clean" test points, and verify our results with numerical experiments. Moreover, we propose an adjustment in the classification setting which we call Contamination Robust Conformal Prediction, and verify the efficacy of our approach using both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Statistical Significance of Deep Nearest Neighbor Anomaly Detection via Selective Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world applications, anomaly detection (AD) often operates without access to anomalous data, necessitating semi-supervised methods that rely solely on normal data. Among these methods, deep k-nearest neighbor (deep kNN) AD stands out for its interpretability and flexibility, leveraging distance-based scoring in deep latent spaces.Despite its strong performance, deep kNN lacks a mechanism to quantify uncertainty-an essential feature for critical applications such as industrial inspection. To address this limitation, we propose a statistical framework that quantifies the significance of detected anomalies in the form of p-values, thereby enabling control over false positive rates at a user-specified significance level (e.g.,0.05). A central challenge lies in managing selection bias, which we tackle using Selective Inference-a principled method for conducting inference conditioned on data-driven selections. We evaluate our method on diverse datasets and demonstrate that it provides reliable AD well-suited for industrial use cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the high-dimensional asymptotics of empirical risk minimization (ERM) in over-parametrized two-layer neural networks with quadratic activations trained on synthetic data. We derive sharp asymptotics for both training and test errors by mapping the $\ell_2$-regularized learning problem to a convex matrix sensing task with nuclear norm penalization. This reveals that capacity control in such networks emerges from a low-rank structure in the learned feature maps. Our results characterize the global minima of the loss and yield precise generalization thresholds, showing how the width of the target function governs learnability. This analysis bridges and extends ideas from spin-glass methods, matrix factorization, and convex optimization and emphasizes the deep link between low-rank matrix sensing and learning in quadratic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Property Elicitation on Imprecise Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution can be determined by minimizing a risk. We investigate a generalization of property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is motivated by distributionally robust optimization and multi-distribution learning. Both those frameworks replace the minimization of a single risk over a (precise) probability by a maximin risk minimization over a set of probabilities -- i.e. an IP. We show what can be learned in those multi-distribution setups by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the elicitability of an IP-property. Central to these conditions is the observation made in related literature that the elicited IP-property is the corresponding classical property of the probability in the IP with the maximum Bayes risk.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>A Trio Neural Model for Dynamic Entity Relatedness Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.08316v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring entity relatedness is a fundamental task for many natural language processing and information retrieval applications. Prior work often studies entity relatedness in static settings and an unsupervised manner. However, entities in real-world are often involved in many different relationships, consequently entity-relations are very dynamic over time. In this work, we propose a neural networkbased approach for dynamic entity relatedness, leveraging the collective attention as supervision. Our model is capable of learning rich and different entity representations in a joint framework. Through extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves better results than competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Limits and Strong Consistency on Binary Non-uniform Hypergraph Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the unsupervised node classification problem on random hypergraphs under the non-uniform Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model (HSBM) with two equal-sized communities. In this model, edges appear independently with probabilities depending only on the labels of their vertices. We identify the threshold for strong consistency, expressed in terms of the Generalized Hellinger distance. Below this threshold, strong consistency is impossible, and we derive the Information-Theoretic (IT) lower bound on the expected mismatch ratio. Above the threshold, the parameter space is typically divided into two disjoint regions. When only the aggregated adjacency matrices are accessible, while one-stage algorithms accomplish strong consistency with high probability in the region far from the threshold, they fail in the region closer to the threshold. We propose a new refinement algorithm which, in conjunction with the initial estimation, provably achieves strong consistency throughout the entire region above the threshold, and attains the IT lower bound when below the threshold, proving its optimality. This novel refinement algorithm applies the power iteration method to a weighted adjacency matrix, where the weights are determined by hyperedge sizes and the initial label estimate. Unlike the constant degree regime where a subset selection of uniform layers is necessary to enhance clustering accuracy, in the scenario with diverging degrees, each uniform layer contributes non-negatively to clustering accuracy. Therefore, aggregating information across all uniform layers yields better performance than using any single layer alone.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Models with Parallel Sampling: Inference at Sub-Linear Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading method for generative modeling of both image and scientific data. As these models are costly to train and \emph{evaluate}, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal. Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly} \log d)$ overall time complexity, marking \emph{the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$}. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters.</description>

      <title>Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-Trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GSM8K-level math-reasoning, GPT-2-level text, and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints, with consistent performance gains across models ranging from 200M to 8B.

      <title>Logarithmic Regret of Exploration in Average Reward Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In average reward Markov decision processes, state-of-the-art algorithms for regret minimization follow a well-established framework: They are model-based, optimistic and episodic. First, they maintain a confidence region from which optimistic policies are computed using a well-known subroutine called Extended Value Iteration (EVI). Second, these policies are used over time windows called episodes, each ended by the Doubling Trick (DT) rule or a variant thereof. In this work, without modifying EVI, we show that there is a significant advantage in replacing (DT) by another simple rule, that we call the Vanishing Multiplicative (VM) rule. When managing episodes with (VM), the algorithm's regret is, both in theory and in practice, as good if not better than with (DT), while the one-shot behavior is greatly improved. More specifically, the management of bad episodes (when sub-optimal policies are being used) is much better under (VM) than (DT) by making the regret of exploration logarithmic rather than linear. These results are made possible by a new in-depth understanding of the contrasting behaviors of confidence regions during good and bad episodes.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Learning for k-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a $k$-SAT formula $\Phi$ where every variable appears at most $d$ times. Let $\sigma$ be a satisfying assignment, sampled proportionally to $e^{\beta m(\sigma)}$ where $m(\sigma)$ is the number of true variables and $\beta$ is a real parameter. Given $\Phi$ and $\sigma$, can we efficiently learn $\beta$?
  This problem falls into a recent line of work about single-sample (``one-shot'') learning of Markov random fields. Our $k$-SAT setting was recently studied by Galanis, Kalavasis, Kandiros (SODA24). They showed that single-sample learning is possible when roughly $d\leq 2^{k/6.45}$ and impossible when $d\geq (k+1) 2^{k-1}$. In addition to the gap in~$d$, their impossibility result left open the question of whether the feasibility threshold for one-shot learning is dictated by the satisfiability threshold for bounded-degree $k$-SAT formulas.
  Our main contribution is to answer this question negatively. We show that one-shot learning for $k$-SAT is infeasible well below the satisfiability threshold; in fact, we obtain impossibility results for degrees $d$ as low as $k^2$ when $\beta$ is sufficiently large, and bootstrap this to small values of $\beta$ when $d$ scales exponentially with $k$, via a probabilistic construction. On the positive side, we simplify the analysis of the learning algorithm, obtaining significantly stronger bounds on $d$ in terms of $\beta$. For the uniform case $\beta\rightarrow 0$, we show that learning is possible under the condition $d\lesssim 2^{k/2}$. This is (up to constant factors) all the way to the sampling threshold -- it is known that sampling a uniformly-distributed satisfying assignment is NP-hard for $d\gtrsim 2^{k/2}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for density-based clustering in high-dimensional spaces that combines Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with the Quick Shift algorithm. The Quick Shift algorithm, known for its hierarchical clustering capabilities, is extended by integrating approximate Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) using LSH to provide efficient density estimates. The proposed approach achieves almost linear time complexity while preserving the consistency of density-based clustering.</description>

      <title>TabPFN: One Model to Rule Them All?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hollmann et al. (Nature 637 (2025) 319-326) recently introduced TabPFN, a transformer-based deep learning model for regression and classification on tabular data, which they claim "outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time." Furthermore, they have called TabPFN a "foundation model" for tabular data, as it can support "data generation, density estimation, learning reusable embeddings and fine-tuning". In this paper, we provide a tailored explanation of how TabPFN works for a statistics audience, by emphasizing its interpretation as approximate Bayesian inference. We then explore the significance of TabPFN to the field of statistics: We show that an out-of-the-box application of TabPFN can sometimes outperform specialized state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised parameter estimation, prediction under covariate shift, and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. As a partial explanation for the predictive effectiveness of TabPFN, we show that it can simultaneously adapt to both nonparametric structure and parametric structure, for instance, sometimes outperforming LASSO even when assumptions are correctly specified. All experiments can be reproduced using the code provided at https://github.com/qinglong-tian/tabpfn_study (https://github.com/qinglong-tian/tabpfn_study).</description>

      <title>Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling of Diffusion-based Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new Bayesian approach to derive and extend the federated Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We show that the solutions of variational-Bayesian objectives are associated with a duality structure that not only resembles ADMM but also extends it. For example, ADMM-like updates are recovered when the objective is optimized over the isotropic-Gaussian family, and new non-trivial extensions are obtained for other more flexible exponential families. Examples include a Newton-like variant that converges in one step on quadratics and an Adam-like variant called IVON-ADMM that has the same cost as Adam but yields up to 7% accuracy boosts in heterogeneous deep learning. Our work opens a new direction to use Bayes to extend ADMM and other primal-dual methods.</description>

      <title>Unifying Re-Identification, Attribute Inference, and Data Reconstruction Risks in Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms are difficult to interpret and calibrate because existing methods for mapping standard privacy parameters to concrete privacy risks -- re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction -- are both overly pessimistic and inconsistent. In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary, including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, R\'enyi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase from 52% to 70% in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scores: Proximal Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have quickly become some of the most popular and powerful generative models for high-dimensional data. The key insight that enabled their development was the realization that access to the score -- the gradient of the log-density at different noise levels -- allows for sampling from data distributions by solving a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) via forward discretization, and that popular denoisers allow for unbiased estimators of this score. In this paper, we demonstrate that an alternative, backward discretization of these SDEs, using proximal maps in place of the score, leads to theoretical and practical benefits. We leverage recent results in proximal matching to learn proximal operators of the log-density and, with them, develop Proximal Diffusion Models (ProxDM). Theoretically, we prove that $\widetilde{O}(d/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ steps suffice for the resulting discretization to generate an $\varepsilon$-accurate distribution w.r.t. the KL divergence. Empirically, we show that two variants of ProxDM achieve significantly faster convergence within just a few sampling steps compared to conventional score-matching methods.</description>

      <title>Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves finetuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pretrained diffusion models together, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to each pretrained model. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively.

      <title>Arithmetic-Mean $\mu$P for Modern Architectures: A Unified Learning-Rate Scale for CNNs and ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing an appropriate learning rate remains a key challenge in scaling depth of modern deep networks. The classical maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) enforces a fixed per-layer update magnitude, which is well suited to homogeneous multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) but becomes ill-posed in heterogeneous architectures where residual accumulation and convolutions introduce imbalance across layers. We introduce Arithmetic-Mean $\mu$P (AM-$\mu$P), which constrains not each individual layer but the network-wide average one-step pre-activation second moment to a constant scale. Combined with a residual-aware He fan-in initialization - scaling residual-branch weights by the number of blocks ($\mathrm{Var}[W]=c/(K\cdot \mathrm{fan\text{-}in})$) - AM-$\mu$P yields width-robust depth laws that transfer consistently across depths. We prove that, for one- and two-dimensional convolutional networks, the maximal-update learning rate satisfies $\eta^\star(L)\propto L^{-3/2}$; with zero padding, boundary effects are constant-level as $N\gg k$. For standard residual networks with general conv+MLP blocks, we establish $\eta^\star(L)=\Theta(L^{-3/2})$, with $L$ the minimal depth. Empirical results across a range of depths confirm the $-3/2$ scaling law and enable zero-shot learning-rate transfer, providing a unified and practical LR principle for convolutional and deep residual networks without additional tuning overhead.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. CoI enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance (AUROC of 0.960 on CKD progression and 0.950 on ICU mortality), with deletion-based sensitivity analyses confirming that CoI's learned attributions faithfully reflect its decision process. Through case studies, we demonstrate that CoI uncovers clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression, offering enhanced transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Private Sketches for Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear regression is frequently applied in a variety of domains, some of which might contain sensitive information. This necessitates that the application of these methods does not reveal private information. Differentially private (DP) linear regression methods, developed for this purpose, compute private estimates of the solution. These techniques typically involve computing a noisy version of the solution vector. Instead, we propose releasing private sketches of the datasets, which can then be used to compute an approximate solution to the regression problem. This is motivated by the \emph{sketch-and-solve} paradigm, where the regression problem is solved on a smaller sketch of the dataset instead of on the original problem space. The solution obtained on the sketch can also be shown to have good approximation guarantees to the original problem. Various sketching methods have been developed for improving the computational efficiency of linear regression problems under this paradigm. We adopt this paradigm for the purpose of releasing private sketches of the data. We construct differentially private sketches for the problems of least squares regression, as well as least absolute deviations regression. We show that the privacy constraints lead to sketched versions of regularized regression. We compute the bounds on the regularization parameter required for guaranteeing privacy. The availability of these private sketches facilitates the application of commonly available solvers for regression, without the risk of privacy leakage.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models are Molecular Dynamics Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a denoising diffusion sampler equipped with a sequential bias across the batch dimension is exactly an Euler-Maruyama integrator for overdamped Langevin dynamics. Each reverse denoising step, with its associated spring stiffness, can be interpreted as one step of a stochastic differential equation with an effective time step set jointly by the noise schedule and that stiffness. The learned score then plays the role of the drift, equivalently the gradient of a learned energy, yielding a precise correspondence between diffusion sampling and Langevin time evolution.
  This equivalence recasts molecular dynamics (MD) in terms of diffusion models. Accuracy is no longer tied to a fixed, extremely small MD time step; instead, it is controlled by two scalable knobs: model capacity, which governs how well the drift is approximated, and the number of denoising steps, which sets the integrator resolution. In practice, this leads to a fully data-driven MD framework that learns forces from uncorrelated equilibrium snapshots, requires no hand-engineered force fields, uses no trajectory data for training, and still preserves the Boltzmann distribution associated with the learned energy.
  We derive trajectory-level, information-theoretic error bounds that cleanly separate discretization error from score-model error, clarify how temperature enters through the effective spring, and show that the resulting sampler generates molecular trajectories with MD-like temporal correlations, even though the model is trained only on static configurations.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering Algorithm with a Self-Adjusting Vigilance Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering in stationary and nonstationary settings, where data distributions remain static or evolve over time, requires models that can adapt to distributional shifts while preserving previously learned cluster structures. This paper proposes an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based topological clustering algorithm that autonomously adjusts its recalculation interval and vigilance threshold through a diversity-driven adaptation mechanism. This mechanism enables hyperparameter-free learning that maintains cluster stability and continuity in dynamic environments. Experiments on 24 real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both clustering performance and continual learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed parameter adaptation in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent clustering in evolving data streams.

      <title>Terminal Velocity Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20207v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the convergence analysis of AdaSLS and AdaSPS in [Jiang and Stich, 2024] to the nonconvex setting, presenting a unified convergence analysis of stochastic gradient descent with adaptive Armijo line-search (AdaSLS) and Polyak stepsize (AdaSPS) for nonconvex optimization. Our contributions include: (1) an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for general nonconvex smooth functions, (2) an $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ rate under quasar-convexity and interpolation, and (3) an $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ rate under the strong growth condition for general nonconvex functions.</description>
