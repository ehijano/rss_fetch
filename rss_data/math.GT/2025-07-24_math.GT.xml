      <title>Smoothing topological pseudo-isotopies of 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed, smooth 4-manifold $X$ and self-diffeomorphism $f$ that is topologically pseudo-isotopic to the identity, we study the question of whether $f$ is moreover smoothly pseudo-isotopic to the identity. If the fundamental group of $X$ lies in a certain class, which includes trivial, free, and finite groups of odd order, we show the answer is always affirmative. On the other hand, we produce the first examples of manifolds $X$ and diffeomorphisms $f$ where the answer is negative. Our investigation is motivated by the question, which remains open, of whether there exists a self-diffeomorphism of a closed 4-manifold that is topologically isotopic to the identity, but not stably smoothly isotopic to the identity.</description>

      <title>Domain of Discontinuity of Anosov Subgroups Acting on Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (by Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and recently Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action (via $\rho$) to the space of connections on the pullback of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$.
  When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex surface, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of the Higgs bundle structures of the $(1,0)$ part of the complexification of these pullback bundles. We further construct a topological free group $F$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and show that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free group is shown to be well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure and construct a natural functor to the category of free groups.</description>

      <title>Horn's problem in PU$(n,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiplicative Horn problem is the following question: given three conjugacy classes $\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2, \mathcal{C}_3$ in a Lie group $G$, do there exist elements $(A,B,C)\in\mathcal{C}_1\times\mathcal{C}_2\times\mathcal{C}_3$ such that $ABC=\operatorname{Id}$? In this paper, we study the multiplicative Horn problem restricted to the elliptic classes of the group $G={\rm PU}(n,1)$ for $n\geq 1$, which is the isometry group of the $n$-dimensional complex hyperbolic space. We show that the solution set of Horn's problem in PU$(n,1)$ is a finite union of convex polytopes in the space of elliptic conjugacy classes. We give a complete description of these polytopes when $n=2$.</description>

Abstract: Freedman and Krushkal showed that if the surgery conjecture and the $s$-cobordism conjecture hold for all topological 4-manifolds, then every link with pairwise zero linking numbers is topologically round handle slice. Kim, Powell, and Teichner showed that every knot is topologically round handle slice. We show that infinitely many knots fail to be smoothly round handle slice.</description>

      <title>Convergence of discrete conformal mappings on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete conformal mappings based on circle packing, vertex scaling, and related structures has had significant activity since Thurston proposed circle packing as a way to approximate conformal maps in the 1980s. The first convergence result of Rodin-Sullivan (1987) proved that circle packing maps do indeed converge to conformal maps to the disk. Recent results have shown convergence of maps of other discrete conformal structures to conformal maps as well. We give a general theorem of convergence of discrete conformal mappings between surfaces that allows for a variety of discrete conformal structures and manifolds with or without boundary. The mappings are a composition of piecewise linear discrete conformal mappings and Riemannian barycentric coordinates, called barycentric discrete conformal maps. Estimates of the barycentric discrete conformal maps allow extraction of convergent subsequences and estimates for the pullback of the Riemannian metric, proving conformality. The theorem requires assumptions on fullness of simplices to prevent degenerate triangles and a local discrete conformal rigidity generalizing hexagonal rigidity of circle packings.</description>

      <title>Analytic Theory on the Space of Blaschke Products: Simultaneous Uniformization and Pressure Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex analytic aspects of the moduli space $\Bcal_d^{fm}$ of degree $d\ge2$ fixed-point-marked Blaschke products. We define a complex structure on $\Bcal_d^{fm}$ and prove the simultaneous uniformization theorem for fixed-point-marked quasi-Blaschke products. As an application, we show that the pressure semi-norms on the space of Blaschke products are non-degenerate outside of the super-attracting locus $\mathcal{SA}^{fm}_d$, which is a codimension-1 subspace of $\Bcal^{fm}_d$.</description>

Abstract: These notes are based on the three lectures that one of the authors gave at Tsinghua University in the summer of 2023 as part of the workshop on Geometric Representation Theory and Applications. They contain an introduction to the evaluation of $\mathsf{SL}(3)$ foams and the associated topological theory of trivalent planar graphs and foam cobordisms between them. A categorification of the Kuperberg quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ web and link invariant and the Robert-Wagner $\mathsf{SL}(N)$ foam evaluation are reviewed as well.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Resolutions and Limits of Manifolds with a Uniform Contractibility Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a short and self-contained proof to a 1991 conjecture by Moore concerning the structure of certain finite-dimensional Gromov--Hausdorff limits, in the ANR setting. As a consequence, one easily characterizes finite dimensional limits of PL-able or Riemannian $n$-manifolds with a uniform contractibility function. For example, one can define for any compact connected metric space that is a resolvable ANR homology manifold of covering dimension at least 5, an obstruction, which vanishes if and only if the homology manifold can be approximated in the Gromov--Hausdorff sense by PL-manifolds of the same dimension and with a uniform contractibility function. Further, it provides short proofs to certain well known results by reducing them to problems in Bing topology. We also give another proof using more classical arguments that yield more structural information. We give several applications to the theory of homology manifolds, Alexandrov spaces, Wasserstein spaces and a generalized form of the diffeomorphism stability conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosymplectic and normal almost contact structures are analogues of symplectic and complex structures that can be defined on 3-manifolds. Their existence imposes strong topological constraints. Generalized geometry offers a natural common generalization of these two structures: $B_3$-generalized complex structures. We prove that any closed orientable 3-manifold admits such a structure, which can be chosen to be stable, that is, generically cosymplectic up to generalized diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Homology and 3-dimensional Besse Manifolds with vanishing first Chern class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show that certain types of symplectic homology can be used as an invariant of 3-dimensional Besse manifolds, which are strict contact manifolds with periodic Reeb flow. For simplicity, we will assume our Besse structures to be a trivial plane bundle. To identify Besse manifolds with such a condition, we actually compute the first Chern class of each Besse structure and classify the Besse manifolds with vanishing first Chern class. We will also compute Robbin-Salamon indices of periodic Reeb orbits in Besse manifolds, and symplectic homology (of its filling) of certain cases. From its definition, Besse manifolds naturally become Seifert fibration and thus one can extract invariants such as the orbifold Euler characteristic and the Euler number of this Seifert fibration. These invariants will become important in our computation.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on virtual moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type by Miyaoka (1977) and Yau (1978). Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>
