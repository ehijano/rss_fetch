      <title>Regular non-normal modal classicalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel investigation into the consistency operator ($\circ$), traditionally associated with paraconsistent logics, as a means of capturing non-normal modal classicalities within the Kripke framework. By semantically reinterpreting $\circ$ as an operator that distinguishes top and bottom values from other values in the algebra, we extend its applicability beyond paraconsistency into classical and modal logics. We introduce the logic $\mathcal{B}_4^\circ$, a four-valued Boolean logic augmented with the consistency operator, and provide a sound and complete axiomatization. Building on this foundation, we extend the semantics to the modal domain using the many-logics modal logic (MLML) framework. Specifically, we construct Kripke frames based on an eight-valued Boolean algebra that contains three distinct four-valued subalgebras, each representing a different world type. Our analysis reveals that the resulting modal logic exhibits a normal local consequence relation alongside a non-normal global consequence relation. Consequently, the characterization of frame properties --such as transitivity, reflexivity, and Euclideanness --deviates from modal logic $K$, requiring novel semantic tools. We further identify new modal formulas in an extended language that capture previously unavailable kinds of accessibility, leading to frame characterizations unattainable in traditional modal frameworks.</description>

      <title>Superamalgamation for modal lattices via non-distributive dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the variety of modal lattices has the superamalgamation property. As a consequence, we obtain that the weak positive modal logic has the Craig interpolation property. Our proof employs the recent duality for modal lattices based on modal L-spaces. Moreover, we extend this result to a number of other weak positive modal logics axiomatized by modal axioms corresponding to universal Horn sentences.</description>

      <title>Almost cohomology of finite-dimensional Lie rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce almost cohomology groups for Lie rings definable in finite-dimensional theory. In particular, we define the 0th and 1st almost cohomology groups of a Lie ring module. Moreover, we prove that the 1st almost cohomology group of a finite-dimensional definable Lie ring module is finite if the 0th almost cohomology group is finite.</description>

      <title>On chromatic number of countable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates when countable graphs have a finite or an infinite chromatic number through model theoretic methods. For Fra\"{i}ss\'{e} limits, we show that instability forces the chromatic number to be infinite, yielding a complete classification of homogeneous graphs with a finite chromatic number. In contrast, Hrushovski construction always produces graphs of finite chromatic number, though the value can be made arbitrarily large. In tame settings -- such as stable graphs of $U$-rank one and graphs definable in o-minimal structures -- an infinite chromatic number necessarily yields arbitrarily large cliques. These results provide a unified framework connecting structural model theoretic properties with chromatic behavior.</description>

      <title>Existential theories of henselian valued fields under a formal smoothness assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existential theories of henselian valued fields of positive characteristic with parameters from a trivially valued subfield. Compared to previous work, we relax perfectness and separability assumptions, and instead work with the weaker algebraic hypothesis of formal smoothness over the parameter field, which we discuss in detail in our setting. Assuming a weak consequence of resolution of singularities, which was already used in previous work, we obtain an axiomatisation of the existential theory of such a valued field in terms of the existential theory of the residue field, both over the same parameter field. This result has natural applications to asymptotic theories of completions of function fields of curves. We work these out in detail for the case of function fields over fairly general pseudo-algebraically closed fields, where we obtain decidability of the sets of universal/existential sentences holding in all completions or all but finitely many completions, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sharply o-minimal structures and sharp cellular decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharply o-minimal structures (denoted \so-minimal) are a strict subclass of the o-minimal structures, aimed at capturing some finer features of structures arising from algebraic geometry and Hodge theory. Sharp o-minimality associates to each definable set a pair of integers known as \emph{format} and \emph{degree}, similar to the ambient dimension and degree in the algebraic case; gives bounds on the growth of these quantities under the logical operations; and allows one to control the geometric complexity of a set in terms of its format and degree. These axioms have significant implications on arithmetic properties of definable sets -- for example, \so-minimality was recently used by the authors to settle Wilkie's conjecture on rational points in $\mathbb{R}_{{\exp}}$-definable sets.
  In this paper we develop some basic theory of sharply o-minimal structures. We introduce the notions of reduction and equivalence on the class of \so-minimal structures. We give three variants of the definition of \so-minimality, of increasing strength, and show that they all agree up to reduction. We also consider the problem of ``sharp cell decomposition'', i.e. cell decomposition with good control on the number of the cells and their formats and degrees. We show that every \so-minimal structure can be reduced to one admitting sharp cell decomposition, and use this to prove bounds on the Betti numbers of definable sets in terms of format and degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the restriction of Ramsey's theorem that arises from considering only translation-invariant colourings of pairs, and show that this has the same strength (both from the viewpoint of Reverse Mathematics and from the viewpoint of Computability Theory) as the {\em Adjacent Hindman's Theorem}, proposed by L. Carlucci (Arch. Math. Log. {\bf 57} (2018), 381--359). We also investigate some higher dimensional versions of both of these statements.</description>

      <title>The Golden Path to Guarded Monotone Strict NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01254v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guarded Monotone Strict NP (GMSNP) extends Monotone Monadic Strict NP (MMSNP) by guarded existentially quantified predicates of arbitrary arities. We prove that the containment and the FO-rewritability problems for GMSNP are decidable, thereby settling an open question of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, later restated by Bourhis and Lutz. Our proof also comes with a 2NEXPTIME upper bound on the complexity of the two problems, which matches the lower bounds for MMSNP due to Bourhis and Lutz. To obtain these results, we significantly improve the state of knowledge of the model-theoretic properties of GMSNP. Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke previously showed that every GMSNP sentence defines a finite union of CSPs of $\omega$-categorical structures. We show that these structures can be used to obtain a reduction from the containment problem for GMSNP to the much simpler problem of testing the existence of a recolouring; a careful analysis of this yields said upper bound for containment. The upper bound for FO-rewritability is subsequently obtained by an application of several standard techniques from the theory of infinite-domain CSPs. As our secondary contribution, we refine the construction of Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke by adding a restricted form of homogeneity to the properties of these structures, making the logic amenable to future complexity classifications for query evaluation using techniques developed for infinite-domain CSPs.</description>

      <title>Free Independence is not definable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free independence is an important tool for studying the structure of operator algebras. It is natural to ask from the model-theoretic standpoint whether free independence is captured well in first-order model theory via the notion of a definable set. We prove that pairs of freely independent elements do not form a definable set in the sense of continuous model theory, relative to the theory of both C$^*$-probability spaces and tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>
