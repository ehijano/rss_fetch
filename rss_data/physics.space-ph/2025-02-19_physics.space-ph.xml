      <title>Electron-induced chemistry and sputtering of volatile species from amorphous and crystalline water ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron irradiation of water-rich ices plays a significant role in initiating the chemical and physical processes on the surface of airless icy bodies in radiation environments such as Europa and Enceladus, as well as on the Moon, comets, and asteroids interacting with the solar wind. The sputtering process by electrons and ions leads to chemical modification and outgassing of their icy surfaces and the subsequent formation of a tenuous atmosphere. Though electron-sputtering yields are known to be lower compared to ion-sputtering yields, one needs to also account for their differential fluxes. In our experiments, the electron-induced sputtering yields of all the gaseous species H2, O, OH, H2O, and O2 are investigated for electron energies lower than 2 keV in terms of partial pressure vs. time of irradiation. The effective averaged change in partial pressure of the desorbed species is converted to the number of sputtered atoms or molecules per second per cm2 from the ice, and then to the sputtering yields (number of species sputtered per electron). Our data agrees well with the previously reported data for the sputtering of O2 and H2O yield for the amorphous ice. We also find that crystalline ice shows significantly lower sputtering yields when compared to amorphous ice, in agreement with the observation of similar trends in the literature. Our work indicates that sputtering yields per keV of O, OH, O2, and H2O drop with increasing electron energy from 0.5 keV to 2 keV.</description>

      <title>Ionosphere of Ganymede: Galileo observations versus test particle simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the plasma environment of Ganymede by means of a collisionless test particle simulation. By coupling the outputs from a DSMC simulation of Ganymede's exosphere (i.e. number density profiles of neutral species such as $\mathrm{H}$, $\mathrm{H_2}$, $\mathrm{O}$, $\mathrm{HO}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{O_2}$ for which we provide parametrisation) with those of a MagnetoHydroDynamic simulation of the interaction between Ganymede and the Jovian plasma (i.e. electric and magnetic fields), we perform a comparison between simulated ion plasma densities and ion energy spectra with those observed in-situ during 6 close flybys of Ganymede by the Galileo spacecraft. We find that not only our test particle simulation sometimes can well reproduce the in-situ ion number density measurement, but also the dominant ion species during these flybys are $\mathrm{H_2^+}$, $\mathrm{O_2^+}$, and occasionally $\mathrm{H_2O^+}$. Although the observed ion energy spectra cannot be reproduced exactly, the simulated ion energy spectra exhibit similar trends to those observed near the closest approach and near the magnetopause crossings but at lower energies. We show that the neutral exosphere plays an important role in supplying plasma to Ganymede's magnetised environment and that additional mechanisms may be at play to energise/accelerate newborn ions from the neutral exosphere.</description>
