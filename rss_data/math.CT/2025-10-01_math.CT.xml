      <title>Double Orthogonal Factorization Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define strict and lax orthogonal factorization systems on double categories. These consist of an orthogonal factorization system on arrows and one on double cells that are compatible with each other. Our definitions are motivated by several explicit examples, including factorization systems on double categories of spans, relations and bimodules. We then prove monadicity results for orthogonal factorization systems on double categories in order to justify our definitions. For fibrant double categories we discuss the structure of the double orthogonal factorization systems that have a given orthogonal factorization system on the arrows in common. Finally, we study the interaction of orthogonal factorization systems on double categories with double fibrations.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theory of stricter $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make strict $n$-categories even stricter by requiring they satisfy higher exchange laws governed by Hadzihasanovic's theory of regular directed complexes. We study the first properties of stricter $n$-categories, in particular, we define the Gray product, and prove stability under suspension, which is non-trivial. After reviewing and briefly expanding the theory diagrammatic sets and their associated model structures for $(\infty, n)$-categories, we construct a folk model structure on stricter $n$-categories, show that the walking equivalence coincides with the stricter polygraph generated by the walking equivalence in diagrammatic sets, and finally, that the folk model structure on stricter $n$-categories is right transferred from the diagrammatic model structure along a nerve construction.</description>

      <title>Applications of Borel-definable homological algebra to locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $\mathrm{Hom}$ functor from the category $\mathbf{LCPAb}$ of locally compact Polish abelian groups to the category $\mathbf{PAb}$ of Polish abelian groups has a total right derived functor, improving on Hoffmann and Spitzweck's construction of its cohomological right derived functor.
  We also apply the description of the left heart of subcategories of $\mathbf{PAb}$ in terms of groups with a Polish cover and Borel-definable group homomorphisms to completely characterize the injective and projective objects in the left heart of $\mathbf{LCPAb}$, as well as in the left heart of its full subcategories spanned by: compactly generated groups, Lie groups, totally disconnected groups, topological torsion groups, topological $p$-groups, locally compact groups of finite ranks, topological torsion groups of finite ranks, topological $p$-groups of finite ranks, and type $\mathbb{A}$ groups.</description>

      <title>Arrow algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures which induce elementary toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction. This includes localic toposes as well as various realizability toposes, in particular, those realizability toposes which are obtained from partial combinatory algebras. Since there are many examples of arrow algebras and arrow algebras have a number of closure properties, including a notion of subalgebra given by a nucleus, arrow algebras provide a flexible tool for constructing toposes; we illustrate this by providing some general tools for creating toposes for Kreisel's modified realizability.</description>

      <title>The Sup Connective in IMALL: A Categorical Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a proof language for intuitionistic multiplicative additive linear logic, incorporating the sup connective that introduces additive pairs with a probabilistic elimination, and sum and scalar products within the proof-terms. We provide an abstract characterisation of the language, revealing that any symmetric monoidal closed category with biproducts and a monomorphism from the semiring of scalars to the semiring Hom(I,I) is suitable for the job. Leveraging the binary biproducts, we define a weighted codiagonal map at the heart of the sup connective.</description>

      <title>Semisimple Field Theories Detect Stable Diffeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the work of the first author, we introduce a notion of semisimple topological field theory in arbitrary even dimension and show that such field theories necessarily lead to stable diffeomorphism invariants. The main result of this paper is a proof that this 'upper bound' is optimal: To this end, we introduce and study a class of `finite path integral' topological field theories which are semisimple and which generalize well known theories constructed by Dijkgraaf-Witten, Freed and Quinn. We show that manifolds satisfying a certain finiteness condition -- including 4-manifolds with finite fundamental group -- are indistinguishable to these field theories if and only if they are stably diffeomorphic. Subject to these finiteness conditions, such finite path integral theories therefore provide the strongest semisimple TFT invariants possible. These results hold for a large class of ambient tangential structures.
  We discuss a number of applications, including the constructions of unoriented 4-dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish unoriented smooth structure and oriented higher-dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish certain exotic spheres.
  Along the way, we show that dimensional reductions of finite path integral theories are again finite path integral theories, we utilize ambidexterity in the rational setting, and we develop techniques related to the $\infty$-categorical M\"obius inversion principle of G\'alvez-Carrillo--Kock--Tonks.</description>
