      <title>Reducing Size Bias in Sampling for Infectious Disease Spread on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemiological models can aid policymakers in reducing disease spread by predicting outcomes based on disease dynamics and contact network characteristics. Accurate calibration of these models requires representative samples of contact networks. In this connection, we investigate the performance of two sampling algorithms - Random Walk (RW) and Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW) - across three network types - Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER), Small-world (SW), and Scale-free (SF). Disease transmission is simulated using a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework. Our findings show that for ER and SW networks, RW overestimates infected individuals and secondary infections by approximately $25\%$, while MHRW produces estimates that align well with the underlying network (UN). Both methods also yield estimates closer to the UN for time-to-infection. However, sampling SF networks introduces significant variability for both algorithms. Removing duplicate samples further reduces MHRW's accuracy in all network types. We apply both algorithms to a cattle movement network consisting of 46,512 farms, exhibiting characteristics of ER, SW, and SF networks. RW overestimates infected farms by approximately $100\%$ and secondary infections by $&gt;900\%$, whereas MHRW reduces these overestimations to approximately $50\%$ and $&lt;800\%$, respectively. Time-to-infection estimates reveal that RW underestimates by approximately $40\%$, while MHRW slightly overestimates by $10\%$. These results highlight the importance of selecting sampling algorithms based on network structure and disease severity. RW provides conservative estimates suited for high-mortality, fast-spreading diseases, while MHRW is more suitable for precise interventions in less severe outbreaks. These insights can guide policymakers in optimising resource allocation and disease control strategies.</description>

      <title>Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing: Insights from Computer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological evolution continuously refines the design of species, resulting in highly optimised organisms over hundreds of millennia. Intuitively, we expect that random changes-evolution's primary mechanism-are more likely to be harmful than beneficial, leading to widespread detrimental effects in evolving species. The Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing (ESTA) suggests that ageing is the cumulative result of these harmful effects, which predominantly cause bodily damage, while a few may lead to beneficial adaptations that evolution can exploit. While the disposable soma theory views ageing as a consequence of limited evolutionary pressure, ESTA posits that ageing is essentially evolution in action. In this study, we gather evidence supporting this theory through computer simulations. We conduct experiments using a platform where genes are linked to onset values that determine when they are expressed. Three scenarios are tested: one with single-point fitness evaluation, constant mutation rate and fixed gene onsets; one with single-point fitness evaluation, onset-dependent mutation rate and fixed gene onsets; and one with spread fitness evaluation, onset-dependent mutation rate and evolvable gene onsets. The last scenario, which embodies the evolvable soma hypothesis, demonstrates superior performance in both algorithmic efficiency and biological plausibility compared to the others.</description>

      <title>Subtree Distances, Tight Spans and Diversities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13202</link>

Abstract: Metric embeddings are central to metric theory and its applications. Here we consider embeddings of a different sort: maps from a set to subsets of a metric space so that distances between points are approximated by minimal distances between subsets. Our main result is a characterization of when a set of distances $d(x,y)$ between elements in a set $X$ have a subtree representation, a real tree $T$ and a collection $\{S_x\}_{x \in X}$ of subtrees of~$T$ such that $d(x,y)$ equals the length of the shortest path in~$T$ from a point in $S_x$ to a point in $S_y$ for all $x,y \in X$. The characterization was first established for {\em finite} $X$ by Hirai (2006) using a tight span construction defined for distance spaces, metric spaces without the triangle inequality. To extend Hirai's result beyond finite $X$ we establish fundamental results of tight span theory for general distance spaces, including the surprising observation that the tight span of a distance space is hyperconvex. We apply the results to obtain the first characterization of when a diversity -- a generalization of a metric space which assigns values to all finite subsets of $X$, not just to pairs -- has a tight span which is tree-like.</description>

      <title>Growth-rate distributions of gut microbiota time series</title>

Abstract: Logarithmic growth-rates are fundamental observables for describing ecological systems and the characterization of their distributions with analytical techniques can greatly improve their comprehension. Here a neutral model based on a stochastic differential equation with demographic noise, which presents a closed form for these distributions, is used to describe the population dynamics of microbiota. Results show that this model can successfully reproduce the log-growth rate distribution of the considered abundance time-series. More significantly, it predicts its temporal dependence, by reproducing its kurtosis evolution when the time lag $\tau$ is increased. Furthermore, its typical shape for large $\tau$ is assessed, verifying that the distribution variance does not diverge with $\tau$. The simulated processes generated by the calibrated stochastic equation and the analysis of each time-series, taken one by one, provided additional support for our approach. Alternatively, we tried to describe our dataset by using a logistic neutral model with an environmental stochastic term. Analytical and numerical results show that this model is not suited for describing the leptokurtic log-growth rates distribution found in our data. These results support an effective neutral model with demographic stochasticity for describing the considered microbiota.</description>

      <title>Simplifying and Characterizing DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks via Least Common Ancestor Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rooted phylogenetic networks, or more generally, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely used to model species or gene relationships that traditional rooted trees cannot fully capture, especially in the presence of reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfers. Such networks or DAGs are typically inferred from observable data (e.g. genomic sequences of extant species), providing only an estimate of the true evolutionary history. However, these inferred DAGs are often complex and difficult to interpret. In particular, many contain vertices that do not serve as least common ancestors (LCAs) for any subset of the underlying genes or species, thus may lack direct support from the observable data. In contrast, LCA vertices are witnessed by historical traces justifying their existence and thus represent ancestral states substantiated by the data. To reduce unnecessary complexity and eliminate unsupported vertices, we aim to simplify a DAG to retain only LCA vertices while preserving essential evolutionary information.
  In this paper, we characterize $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant and $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant DAGs, defined as those in which every vertex serves as an LCA (or unique LCA) for some subset of taxa. We introduce methods to identify LCAs in DAGs and efficiently transform any DAG into an $\mathrm{LCA}$-relevant or $\mathrm{lca}$-relevant one while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG or network. This transformation is achieved using a simple operator ``$\ominus$'' that mimics vertex suppression.</description>
