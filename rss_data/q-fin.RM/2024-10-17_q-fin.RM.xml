      <title>Optimization of Actuarial Neural Networks with Response Surface Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the data-driven world of actuarial science, machine learning (ML) plays a crucial role in predictive modeling, enhancing risk assessment and pricing strategies. Neural networks, specifically combined actuarial neural networks (CANN), are vital for tasks such as mortality forecasting and pricing. However, optimizing hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates, layers) is essential for resource efficiency.
  This study utilizes a factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize CANN performance. RSM effectively explores the hyperparameter space and captures potential curvature, outperforming traditional grid search. Our results show accurate performance predictions, identifying critical hyperparameters. By dropping statistically insignificant hyperparameters, we reduced runs from 288 to 188, with negligible loss in accuracy, achieving near-optimal out-of-sample Poisson deviance loss.</description>

      <title>Impact of social factors on loan delinquency in microfinance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops multistate models to analyse loan delinquency in the microfinance sector, using data from Ghana. The models are designed to account for both partial repayments and the short repayment durations typical in microfinance, focusing on estimating the probability of transitions between two or three repayment states, including delinquency. Social variables, such as religious and cultural factors, were found to play a statistically significant role in influencing repayment behavior, highlighting the impact of societal dynamics on financial outcomes. We explored both time-independent and time-dependent frailty models to capture unobserved heterogeneity. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of social factors in delinquency but suggest limited predictive gains from incorporating frailties into multistate models.</description>
