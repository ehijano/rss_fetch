      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic 4-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We also give a few applications, ranging from embeddings of singular Lagrangian RP^2s to realizing an infinite family of lens spaces as hypersurfaces of contact type in a symplectic Hirzebruch surface. Furthermore, our investigation on S^1-invariant contact structures also suggests there should be a universal upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the singularity).</description>

      <title>Balanced genus and a lower bound theorem for balanced 3- and 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new PL invariant, called the balanced genus, for balanced normal $d$-pseudomanifolds. As a key result, we establish that for any 3-manifold $M$ that is not a sphere, the balanced genus satisfies the lower bound $\mathcal{G}_M \geq m+3$, where $m$ is the rank of its fundamental group. Furthermore, we prove that a 3-manifold $M$ is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere if and only if its balanced genus $\mathcal{G}_M$ is at most 3.
  For 4-manifolds, we establish a similar characterization: if $M$ is not homeomorphic to a sphere, then its balanced genus is bounded below by $\mathcal{G}_M \geq 2\chi(M) + 5m + 11$, where $m$ is the rank of $\pi_1(M)$. Additionally, we prove that a 4-manifold $M$ is PL-homeomorphic to the 4-sphere if and only if its balanced genus satisfies $\mathcal{G}_M \leq 2\chi(M) + 10$.
  We believe that the balanced genus provides a new perspective in combinatorial topology and will inspire further developments in the field. To this end, we outline several research directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Triangulations of the `magic manifold' and families of census knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe five ideal triangulations of the 3-cusped hyperbolic `magic manifold' that are each compatible with well-established techniques for triangulating Dehn fillings. Using these techniques, we construct low-complexity triangulations for all partial fillings of the magic manifold, and in particular, recover minimal triangulations for 229 of the hyperbolic census knots. Along the way, these census knots are sorted into 42 families related by twisting that can be extended indefinitely, with each member of each infinite family inheriting an upper bound on its triangulation complexity. These triangulations are conjectured to be minimal for all 42 families.</description>

      <title>Puncture loops on a non-orientable surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a connected surface $N$ with negative Euler characteristic, the free homotopy class of a loop obtained by smoothing an intersection of two closed geodesics may wind around a puncture. Chas and Kabiraj showed that this phenomenon does not occur when the surface $N$ is orientable. In this paper, we prove that it occurs when $N$ is non-orientable and both geodesics involved in the smoothing are actually one-sided. In particular, we study a loop obtained by traversing a one-sided closed geodesic and the $m$-th power of another one-sided closed geodesic for odd $m$. Then we show that its free homotopy class may wind aroud a puncture at most two values of $m$. Furthermore, if two such $m$'s exist, they are consecutive odd integers.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolization and geometric decomposition of a class of 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thurston's triangulation conjecture asserts that every hyperbolic 3-manifold admits a geometric triangulation into hyper-ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra. So far, this conjecture had only been proven for a few special 3-manifolds. In this article, we confirm this conjecture for a class of 3-manifolds. To be precise, let $M$ be an oriented compact 3-manifold with boundary, no component of which is a 2-sphere, and $\mathcal{T}$ is an ideal triangulation of $M$. If $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies properly gluing condition, and the valence is at least 6 at each ideal edge and 11 at each hyper-ideal edge, then $M$ admits an unique complete hyperbolic metric with totally geodesic boundary, so that $\mathcal{T}$ is isotopic to a geometric ideal triangulation of $M$.
  We use analytical tools such as combinatorial Ricci flow (CRF, abbr.) to derive the conclusions. There are intrinsic difficulties in dealing with CRF. First, the CRF may collapse in a finite time, second, most of the smooth curvature flow methods are no longer applicable since there is no local coordinates in $\mathcal{T}$, and third, the evolution of CRF is affected by certain combinatorial obstacles in addition to topology. To this end, we introduce the ideas as ``extending CRF", ``tetrahedral comparison principles", and ``control CRF with edge valence" to solve the above difficulties. In addition, the presence of torus boundary adds substantial difficulties in this article, which we have solved by introducing the properly gluing conditions on $\mathcal{T}$ and reducing the ECRF to a flow relatively easy to handle.</description>

      <title>Morse theory of loop spaces and Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth closed $n$-manifold $M$ and a $\kappa$-tuple of basepoints $\boldsymbol{q}\subset M$, we define a Morse-type $A_\infty$-algebra $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$, called the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra, as a graded generalization of the braid skein algebra due to Morton and Samuelson. For example, when $M=T^2$ the braid skein algebra is the Type A double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA). The $A_\infty$-operations couple Morse gradient trees on a based loop space with Chas-Sullivan type string operations. We show that, after a certain "base change", $CM_{-*}(\Omega(M,\boldsymbol{q}))$ is $A_\infty$-equivalent to the wrapped higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer $A_\infty$-algebra of $\kappa$ disjoint cotangent fibers which was studied in the work of Honda, Colin, and Tian. We also compute the based multiloop $A_\infty$-algebra for $M=S^2$, which we can regard as a derived Hecke algebra of the $2$-sphere.</description>

      <title>Bridge trisections in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and the Thom conjecture (with Corrigendum)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.10131v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop new techniques for understanding surfaces in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ via bridge trisections. Trisections are a novel approach to smooth 4-manifold topology, introduced by Gay and Kirby, that provide an avenue to apply 3-dimensional tools to 4-dimensional problems. Meier and Zupan subsequently developed the theory of bridge trisections for smoothly embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds. The main application of these techniques is a new proof of the Thom conjecture, which posits that algebraic curves in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ have minimal genus among all smoothly embedded, oriented surfaces in their homology class. This new proof is notable as it completely avoids any gauge theory or pseudoholomorphic curve techniques.
  Corrigendum: This paper contains a fatal error in the proof of Theorem 1.1, which is the headline result of the paper. The error is localized to Section 6 and is described in a Corrigendum at the end of this updated version. The remaining results in Sections 1 through 5 remain valid.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg homology on surface configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.00515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representations of the classical braid groups, we study the homology of unordered configurations in an orientable genus-$g$ surface with one boundary component, over non-commutative local systems defined from representations of the discrete Heisenberg group. Mapping classes act on the local systems and for a general representation of the Heisenberg group we obtain a representation of the mapping class group that is twisted by this action. For the linearisation of the affine translation action of the Heisenberg group we obtain a genuine, untwisted representation of the mapping class group. In the case of the generic Schr\"odinger representation, by composing with a Stone-von Neumann isomorphism we obtain a projective representation by bounded operators on a Hilbert space, which lifts to a representation of the stably universal central extension of the mapping class group. We also discuss the finite dimensional Schr\"odinger representations, especially in the even case. Based on a natural intersection pairing, we show that our representations preserve a sesquilinear form.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm that computes Friedl and L\"uck's twisted $L^2$-Euler characteristic for a suitable regular CW complex, employing Oki's matrix expansion algorithm to indirectly evaluate the Dieudonn\'e determinant. The algorithm needs to run for an extremely long time to certify its outputs, but a truncated, human-assisted version produces very good results in many cases, such as hyperbolic link complements, closed census 3-manifolds, free-by-cyclic groups, and higher-dimensional examples, such as the fiber of the Ratcliffe-Tschantz manifold.</description>

      <title>Roots of Alexander polynomials of random positive 3-braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by an observation of Dehornoy, we study the roots of Alexander polynomials of knots and links that are closures of positive 3-strand braids. We give experimental data on random such braids and find that the roots exhibit marked patterns, which we refine into precise conjectures. We then prove several results along those lines, for example that generically at least 69% of the roots are on the unit circle, which appears to be sharp. We also show there is a large root-free region near the origin. We further study the equidistribution properties of such roots by introducing a Lyapunov exponent of the Burau representation of random positive braids, and a corresponding bifurcation measure. In the spirit of Deroin and Dujardin, we conjecture that the bifurcation measure gives the limiting measure for such roots, and prove this on a region with positive limiting mass. We use tools including work of Gambaudo and Ghys on the signature function of links, for which we prove a central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a branched cover of manifolds, one can lift homeomorphisms along the cover to obtain a (virtual) homomorphism between mapping class groups. Following a question of Margalit-Winarski, we study the injectivity of this lifting map in the case of $3$-manifolds. We show that in contrast to the case of surfaces, the lifting map is generally not injective for most regular branched covers of $3$-manifolds. This includes the double cover of $S^3$ branched over the unlink, which generalizes the hyperelliptic branched cover of $S^2$. In this case, we find a finite normal generating set for the kernel of the lifting map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non-negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$.
  The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem we use a generalization of Pontryagin's theorem for manifolds with respect to their boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We investigate mappings $F = (f_1, f_2) \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 $ where $ f_1, f_2 $ are bivariate normal densities from the perspective of singularity theory of mappings, motivated by the need to understand properties of two-component bivariate normal mixtures. We show a classification of mappings $ F = (f_1, f_2) $ via $\mathcal{A}$-equivalence and characterize them using statistical notions. Our analysis reveals three distinct types, each with specific geometric properties. Furthermore, we determine the upper bounds for the number of modes in the mixture for each type.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens off as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>

Abstract: For a convergence group equipped with an expanding coarse-cocycle, we construct finitely generated free subsemigroups, which we call $\textit{Bishop--Jones}$ $\textit{semigroups}$, of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than the critical exponent of the ambient group. As an application, we show that for any non-elementary transverse subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$, there exist finitely generated free Anosov subsemigroups in the sense of Kassel--Potrie of critical exponent arbitrarily close to but strictly less than that of the ambient transverse group. Furthermore, we show that these semigroups admit $\mathcal{C}$-regular quasi-isometric embeddings into the symmetric space $X$ of $G$, in the sense of Kapovich--Leeb--Porti.</description>
