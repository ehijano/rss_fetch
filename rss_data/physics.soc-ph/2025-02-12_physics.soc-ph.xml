      <title>Network Dynamics in Mixed Martial Arts: A Complex Systems Approach to Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Competition Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has grown from a niche combat sport promotion into a globally recognized competitive enterprise. This study applies complex network analysis to explore the structural evolution of UFC matchmaking and its impact on competitive dynamics, fighter prominence, and audience engagement. By constructing directed and undirected networks where fighters represent nodes and bouts define edges, we examine key metrics such as degree distribution, clustering, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Our findings reveal how the UFC's matchmaking strategies transitioned from tightly clustered, repetitive matchups in its early years to a more decentralized and strategically curated fight network. We identify distinct structural properties between winners and losers, showing that successful fighters maintain centrality while frequently losing fighters exhibit surprising degrees of sustained connectivity. Correlations with Pay-Per-View sales and Google search trends suggest that network dispersion and novelty in matchups drive greater audience interest, while excessive clustering and density reduce engagement. Furthermore, comparisons with official rankings (Pound-for-Pound, champions, and top-15 fighters) demonstrate that traditional success metrics only partially align with network-based prominence, highlighting the complex interplay between structural connectivity, commercial appeal, and competitive success. This research contributes to the understanding of sports as complex adaptive systems and provides insights into how strategic matchmaking shapes both competitive integrity and economic viability in professional mixed martial arts.</description>

      <title>Spreading dynamics of information on online social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media is profoundly changing our society with its unprecedented spreading power. Due to the complexity of human behaviors and the diversity of massive messages, the information spreading dynamics are complicated, and the reported mechanisms are different and even controversial. Based on data from mainstream social media platforms, including WeChat, Weibo, and Twitter, cumulatively encompassing a total of 7.45 billion users, we uncover a ubiquitous mechanism that the information spreading dynamics are basically driven by the interplay of social reinforcement and social weakening effects. Accordingly, we propose a concise equation, which, surprisingly, can well describe all the empirical large-scale spreading trajectories. Our theory resolves a number of controversial claims and satisfactorily explains many phenomena previously observed. It also reveals that the highly clustered nature of social networks can lead to rapid and high-frequency information bursts with relatively small coverage per burst. This vital feature enables social media to have a high capacity and diversity for information dissemination, beneficial for its ecological development.</description>

      <title>The Human Capital Accumulation at Research Infrastructures: Reexamining Wage Returns to Training, Models, Interpretation, and Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a research strategy to measure wage returns of research training targeting early career researchers (ECRs) at research infrastructures (RIs). Grounded in established economic models of education and training, our strategy improves upon existing studies on the same topic in labour market relevance, scope, and economic modelling. We draw on a survey of ECRs at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and find that CERN research training increases ECRs wages by 7 per cent on average, ranging from 2 to 10 per cent. Wage gains materialise early in their careers, typically within the first decade of employment. Wage returns are driven by hard skills, such as software development, data analysis, and problem solving capacity, as well as sought after soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and networking. Our findings suggest that ECRs wage returns primarily reflect productivity improvements rather than the signalling effect of CERN affiliation. Our research applies to other RIs. We conclude by discussing methodological considerations, policy implications, and avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Efficient method for profiling core-periphery structures in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Profiling core-periphery structures in networks has attracted significant attention, leading to the development of various methods. Among these, the rich-core method is distinguished for being entirely parameter-free and scalable to large networks; however, the cores it identifies are not always optimal. Here, we propose an improved method building upon the rich-core framework. Instead of relying solely on node degree, our approach incorporates both the node's coreness $k$ and its centrality within the $k$-core. We apply the approach to twelve real-world networks, and find that the cores identified are generally denser compared to those derived from previous rich-core method. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural way for identifying an exceptionally dense core, i.e., a clique, which often approximates or even matches the maximum clique in many real-world networks. Furthermore, we extend the method to multiplex networks, and show its effectiveness in identifying dense multiplex cores across several well-studied datasets. Our study may offer valuable insights into exploring the meso-scale properties of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Valeriepieris Circles Reveal City and Regional Boundaries in England and Wales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method of determining regional and city boundaries based on the Valeriepieris circle, the smallest circle containing a given fraction of the data. By varying the fraction in the circle we can map complex spatial data to a simple model of concentric rings which we then fit to determine natural density cutoffs. We apply this method to population, occupation, economic and transport data from England and Wales, finding that the regions determined by this method affirm well known social facts such as the disproportionate wealth of London or the relative isolation of the North East and South West of England. We then show how different data sets give us different views of the same cities, providing insight into their development and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: For the last 60 years, advances in conventional computing platforms have been driven by the empirical notion known as Moores law. In its essence, Moores law is a ubiquitous description of the exponential increase in transistor density acting as a proxy for computing power as a function of time. While this trend started as an interesting observation, it has evolved into a self-fulfilling prophecy used to drive the entire semiconductor industry. Arguments for or against the end of Moores law have proliferated and the reluctant consensus is that Moores law will disappear. Warnings of the end of this trend have been repeatedly thwarted by advances in many different aspects of the computing ecosystem including materials improvements, device design, device or circuit cleverness, and software and architectural innovations. While many have argued the impending doom of Moores law is the ultimate roadblock imposed by atomic length scales, quantum processes, and energy consumption limits, we contend that Moores law must be jettisoned for a different reason: Words matter. Even those who adamantly declare the end of Moores law still use the language of Moores law. The inward focus of this notion imposes an intellectual tyranny that inhibits revolutionary progress. We suggest instead a more outwardly focused perspective and suggest a shift in language to a regime we coin the Feynman Mandate. In this perspective, we outline the issues with the continued use of Moores law as well as a prescription of transitioning to a new lexicon. We outline a new, more general metric for ascertaining progress and identify the roles of various stakeholders in this process.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis of brain dynamical signals indicates signatures of seizure susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictal periods), but its effects on background (non-ictal) brain dynamics remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed an in-house dataset of brain activity recordings from epileptic zebrafish, focusing on two controlled genetic conditions across two fishlines. After using machine learning to segment and label recordings, we applied time-delay embedding and Persistent Homology -- a noise-robust method from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) -- to uncover topological patterns in brain activity. We find that ictal and non-ictal periods can be distinguished based on the topology of their dynamics, independent of genetic condition or fishline, which validates our approach. Remarkably, within a single wild-type fishline, we identified topological differences in non-ictal periods between seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. These findings suggest that epilepsy leaves detectable topological signatures in brain dynamics even outside of ictal periods. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of TDA as a quantitative framework to screen for topological markers of epileptic susceptibility, with potential applications across species.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Bitcoin Mesoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The open availability of the entire history of the Bitcoin transactions opens up the possibility to study this system at an unprecedented level of detail. This contribution is devoted to the analysis of the mesoscale structural properties of the Bitcoin User Network (BUN), across its entire history (i.e. from 2009 to 2017). What emerges from our analysis is that the BUN is characterized by a core-periphery structure a deeper analysis of which reveals a certain degree of bow-tieness (i.e. the presence of a Strongly-Connected Component, an IN- and an OUT-component together with some tendrils attached to the IN-component). Interestingly, the evolution of the BUN structural organization experiences fluctuations that seem to be correlated with the presence of bubbles, i.e. periods of price surge and decline observed throughout the entire Bitcoin history: our results, thus, further confirm the interplay between structural quantities and price movements observed in previous analyses.</description>
