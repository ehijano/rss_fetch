      <title>Epistemic Logic Programs: Non-Ground and Counting Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a prominent problem-modeling and solving framework, whose solutions are called answer sets. Epistemic logic programs (ELP) extend ASP to reason about all or some answer sets. Solutions to an ELP can be seen as consequences over multiple collections of answer sets, known as world views. While the complexity of propositional programs is well studied, the non-ground case remains open. This paper establishes the complexity of non-ground ELPs. We provide a comprehensive picture for well-known program fragments, which turns out to be complete for the class NEXPTIME with access to oracles up to \Sigma^P_2. In the quantitative setting, we establish complexity results for counting complexity beyond #EXP. To mitigate high complexity, we establish results in case of bounded predicate arity, reaching up to the fourth level of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we provide ETH-tight runtime results for the parameter treewidth, which has applications in quantitative reasoning, where we reason on (marginal) probabilities of epistemic literals.</description>

      <title>Games with $\omega$-Automatic Preference Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nash equilibria (NEs) in multi-player turn-based games on graphs, where player preferences are modeled as $\omega$-automatic relations via deterministic parity automata. Unlike much of the existing literature, which focuses on specific reward functions, our results apply to any preference relation definable by an $\omega$-automatic relation. We analyze the computational complexity of determining the existence of an NE (possibly under some constraints), verifying whether a given strategy profile forms an NE, and checking whether a specific outcome can be realized by an NE. Finally, we explore fundamental properties of $\omega$-automatic relations and their implications in the existence of equilibria and finite-memory strategies.</description>

      <title>Safety Verification of Stochastic Systems under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the verification problem of stochastic systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. We propose a novel approach that enables the verification of the probabilistic satisfaction of STL specifications for nonlinear systems subject to both bounded deterministic disturbances and stochastic disturbances. Our method, referred to as the STL erosion strategy, reduces the probabilistic verification problem into a deterministic verification problem with a tighter STL specification. The degree of tightening is determined by leveraging recent results on bounding the deviation between the stochastic trajectory and the deterministic trajectory. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with any existing deterministic STL verification algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to showcase the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>MiniF2F in Rocq: Automatic Translation Between Proof Assistants -- A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct an experiment using state-of-the-art LLMs to translate MiniF2F into Rocq. The translation task focuses on generating a Rocq theorem based on three sources: a natural language description, the Lean formalization, and the Isabelle formalization. We conducted our experiment in 3 stages of increasing complexity, from basic one-shot prompting to multi-turn conversations that incorporate feedback from unsuccessful attempts. At each stage, we perform multiple rounds of translation using increasingly advanced models: GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1 mini, and o1. We successfully translated 478 out of 488 theorems. The dataset is opensource: https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/miniF2F-rocq.</description>

      <title>Generating Millions Of Lean Theorems With Proofs By Exploring State Transition Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in generating mathematical proofs. However, a persistent challenge is that LLMs occasionally make mistakes, while even a minor mistake can invalidate an entire proof. Proof assistants like Lean offer a great remedy. They are designed for verifying each step of a proof in a formal language, and in recent years researchers have created AI models to generate proofs in their languages. However, the scarcity of large-scale datasets of Lean proofs restrict the performance of such Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) models.
  We developed LeanNavigator, a novel method for generating a large-scale dataset of Lean theorems and proofs by finding new ways to prove existing Lean theorems. By leveraging an interactive Lean client and an efficient method for proof step generation, LeanNavigator efficiently produces new theorems with corresponding proofs. Applying this approach to Mathlib4, we generated 4.7 million theorems totaling 1 billion tokens, surpassing previous datasets by more than an order of magnitude. Using this extensive dataset, we trained an AI model that outperforms the state-of-the-art ReProver model in theorem-proving tasks. These results confirm our hypothesis and demonstrate the critical role of large datasets in improving the performance of automated theorem provers.</description>

      <title>SMT(LIA) Sampling with High Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Linear Integer Arithmetic, SMT(LIA) for short, is pivotal across various critical domains. Previous research has primarily focused on SMT solving techniques. However, in practical applications such as software and hardware testing, there is a need to generate a diverse set of solutions for use as test inputs. We have developed the first sampling framework that integrates local search with CDCL(T) techniques, named HighDiv, capable of generating a highly diverse set of solutions for constraints under linear integer theory. Initially, in the local search phase, we introduced a novel operator called boundary-aware movement. This operator performs random moves by considering the current state's constraints on variables, thereby enhancing the diversity of variables during the search process. Furthermore, we have conducted an in-depth study of the preprocessing and variable initialization mechanisms within the framework, which significantly enhances the efficiency of subsequent local searches. Lastly, we use the solutions obtained from local search sampling as additional constraints to further explore the solution space using the stochastic CDCL(T) method. Experimental results demonstrate that \HighDiv generates solutions with greater diversity compared to the state-of-the-art SMT(LIA) sampling tool, MeGASampler.</description>

      <title>On the Logical Content of Logic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic programming (LP) is typically understood through operational semantics (e.g., SLD-resolution) or model-theoretic interpretations (e.g., the least Herbrand model). This paper introduces a novel perspective on LP by defining a ``support'' relation that explicates what a program ``knows''. This interpretation is shown to express classical and intuitionistic logic, as well as an intermediate logic, depending on certain choices regarding LP and the meanings of disjunction and negation. These results are formalized using the idea of base-extension semantics within proof-theoretic semantics. Our approach offers new insights into the logical foundations of LP and has potential applications in knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and formal verification.</description>

      <title>Proof-theoretic Semantics for Classical Propositional Logic with Assertion and Denial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of proof-theoretic semantics (P-tS) offers an alternative approach to meaning in logic that is based on inference and argument (rather than truth in a model). It has been successfully developed for various logics; in particular, Sandqvist has developed such semantics for both classical and intuitionistic logic. In the case of classical logic, P-tS provides a conception of consequence that avoids an \emph{a priori} commitment to the principle of bivalence, addressing what Dummett identified as a significant foundational challenge in logic. In this paper, we propose an alternative P-tS for classical logic, which essentially extends the P-tS for intuitionistic logic by operating over literals rather than atomic propositions. Importantly, literals are atomic and not defined by negation but are defined by inferential relationships. This semantics illustrates the perspective that classical logic can be understood as intuitionistic logic supplemented by a principle of duality, offering fresh insights into the relationship between these two systems.</description>

      <title>Dependent Directed Wiring Diagrams for Composing Instantaneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed wiring diagrams can be used as a composition pattern for composing input/output systems such as Moore machines. In a Moore machine, the input parametrizes an internal state and the internal state defines the output. Because the value of the output is shielded from the input by the internal state, Moore machines can compose by connecting the output of any machine to the input of any other machine. These connections are defined by the trace wires in a directed wiring diagram. Unlike Moore machines, Mealy machines allow the output to be directly and instantaneously affected by the input. In order to compose such machines via directed wiring diagrams, it is necessary to avoid cycles between trace wires in the wiring digram and dependencies of outputs on inputs. To capture these patterns of composition, we introduce an operad of dependent directed wiring diagrams. We then define an algebra of Mealy machines on this operad and an algebra of stock and flow diagrams in which the values of auxiliary variables are parameterized by inputs. Finally, we give a semantics for this algebra of stock and flow diagrams by giving a morphism of algebras from stock and flow diagrams into Mealy machines.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Querying First-Order Theories via Countermodels of Finite Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>

      <title>A minimal base or a direct base? That is the question!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the problem of computing the closure of a set of attributes given a basis of dependencies or implications. This problem is of main interest in logics, in the relational database model, in lattice theory, and in Formal Concept Analysis as well. A basis of dependencies may have different characteristics, among which being ``minimal'', e.g., the Duquenne-Guigues Basis, or being ``direct'', e.g., the the Canonical Basis and the D-basis. Here we propose an extensive and experimental study of the impacts of minimality and directness on the closure algorithms. The results of the experiments performed on real and synthetic datasets are analyzed in depth, and suggest a different and fresh look at computing the closure of a set of attributes w.r.t. a basis of dependencies.

      <title>Quasi-Isometric Reductions Between Infinite Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the recursion-theoretic aspects of large-scale geometries of infinite strings, a subject initiated by Khoussainov and Takisaka (2017). We investigate several notions of quasi-isometric reductions between recursive infinite strings and prove various results on the equivalence classes of such reductions. The main result is the construction of two infinite recursive strings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha$ is strictly quasi-isometrically reducible to $\beta$, but the reduction cannot be made recursive. This answers an open problem posed by Khoussainov and Takisaka.</description>
