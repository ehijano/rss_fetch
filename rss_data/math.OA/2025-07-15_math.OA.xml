      <title>Boundary quotients of C$^*$-algebras of left cancellative monoids and their groupoid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a left cancellative monoid $S$ we consider a quotient of the reduced semigroup C$^*$-algebra $C_r^*(S)$ known as the boundary quotient. We present two potential groupoid models for this boundary quotient, obtained as reductions of Paterson and Spielberg's groupoids associated to $S$, and formulate conditions on $S$ which guarantees that either is a groupoid model. We outline how these conditions are related to the notions (strong) C$^*$-regularity introduced in a previous paper, and construct an example of a left cancellative monoid which is not C$^*$-regular, but satisfies both of the new conditions.</description>

      <title>Annealed almost periodic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies certain notions of entropy that can be associated to (i) a representation of a separable, unital C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and (ii) an auxiliary random sequence $(\pi_n)_{n\ge 1}$ of finite-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{A}$. This continues a previous research program into the properties of these entropy notions when each $\pi_n$ is deterministic, which uncovered a range of analogies with entropy in ergodic theory and also with non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorems.
  We associate two new notions of entropy to data as in (i) and (ii) above: `annealed' AP entropy, which is roughly a kind of first-moment average of deterministic AP entropies; and `zeroth-order' AP entropy, which controls the large deviations probabilities that certain positive definite functions appear in the representations $\pi_n$ at all.
  After developing some of this general theory, we then focus on the special case in which $\mathfrak{A}$ is the group C*-algebra of a finitely-generated free group and each $\pi_n$ is generated by choosing a tuple of $n$-by-$n$ unitary matrices independently at random from Haar measure. In that case, explicit formulas can be derived for some of our notions of entropy, and new large deviations principles in random matrix theory are obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional model spaces invariant under composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional model spaces are quotient spaces of the Hardy space on the open unit disc, determined by finite Blaschke products. Composition operators, on the other hand, act by composing Hardy space functions with analytic self-maps of the open unit disc. Both are classical and well-studied objects in the theory of analytic function spaces. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of finite-dimensional model spaces that are invariant under composition operators. Finite cyclic groups and the prime factorizations of natural numbers play a crucial role in understanding the structure of such invariant subspaces and the associated analytic self-maps.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if the unital $C^*$-algebras $\cl A$ and $\cl B$ satisfy Kadison's similarity property and the length $L=L\left(\cl A\tens\limits_{max}\cl B\right)$ of their maximal tensor product is finite, then $\cl A\tens\limits_{max}\cl \cl B$ satisfies Kadison's similarity property with similarity length $\ell\left(\cl A\tens\limits_{max}\cl B\right)\leq L \max\left\{\ell(\cl A),\,\ell(\cl B)\right\}.$</description>

      <title>A spectral radius for matrices over an operator space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With every operator space structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $\mathbb{C}^d$, we associate a spectral radius function $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}$ on $d$-tuples of operators. For a $d$-tuple $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_d) \in M_n(\mathbb{C}^d)$ of matrices we show that $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(X)&lt;1$ if and only if $X$ is jointly similar to a tuple in the open unit ball of $M_n(\mathcal{E})$, that is, there is an invertible matrix $S$ such that $\|S^{-1}X S\|_{M_n(\mathcal{E})}&lt;1$, where $S^{-1} X S =(S^{-1} X_1 S, \ldots, S^{-1} X_d S)$. When $\mathcal{E}$ is the row operator space, for example, our spectral radius coincides with the joint spectral radius considered by Bunce, Popescu, and others, and we recover the condition for a tuple of matrices to be simultaneously similar to a strict row contraction. When $\mathcal{E}$ is the minimal operator space $\min(\ell^\infty_d)$, our spectral radius $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}$ is related to the joint spectral radius considered by Rota and Strang but differs from it and has the advantage that $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(X)&lt;1$ if and only if $X$ is simultaneously similar to a tuple of strict contractions. We show that for a nc rational function $f$ with descriptor realization $(A,b,c)$, the spectral radius $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(A)&lt;1$ if and only the domain of $f$ contains a neighborhood of the noncommutative closed unit ball of the operator space dual $\mathcal{E}^*$ of $\mathcal{E}$.</description>

      <title>Gluing topological graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce regular closed subgraphs of Katsura's topological graphs and use them to generalize the notion of an adjunction space from topology. Our construction attaches a topological graph onto another via a regular factor map. We prove that under suitable assumptions the C*-algebra of the adjunction graph is a pullback of the C*-algebras of the topological graphs being glued. Our results generalize certain pushout-to-pullback theorems proved in the context of discrete directed graphs. Our theorem applied to homeomorphism C*-algebras recovers a special case of the well-known result stating that pullbacks of $\mathbb{Z}$-C*-algebras induce pullbacks of the respective crossed product C*-algebras. Furthermore, we show that the C*-algebras of odd-dimensional quantum balls of Hong and Szyma\'nski (which are known not to be graph C*-algebras) are topological graph C*-algebras and we recover the pullback structure of C*-algebras of odd-dimensional quantum spheres by gluing the topological graphs associated to the C*-algebras of the corresponding odd-dimensional quantum balls.</description>

      <title>Weak* decomposition and Radon-Nikodym theorem for quantum expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum expectation is a positive linear functional of norm one on a non-commutative probability space (i.e., a C*-algebra). For a given pair of quantum expectations $\mu$ and $\lambda$ on a non-commutative probability space $A$, we propose a definition for weak* continuity and weak* singularity of $\mu$ with respect to $\lambda$. Then, using the theory of von Neumann algebras, we obtain the natural weak* continuous and weak* singular parts of $\mu$ with respect to $\lambda$. If $\lambda$ satisfies a weak tracial property known as the KMS condition, we show that our weak* decomposition coincides with the Arveson-Gheondea-Kavruk Lebesgue (AGKL) decomposition. This equivalence allows us to compute the Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $\lambda$. We also discuss the possibility of extending our results to the positive linear functionals defined on the Cuntz-Toeplitz operator system.</description>

Abstract: We introduce regular morphisms of topological quivers and show that they give rise to a subcategory of the category of topological quivers and quiver morphisms. Our regularity conditions render the topological quiver C*-algebra construction a contravariant functor from the category of topological quivers and regular morphisms into the category of C*-algebras and $*$-homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Bounded geometry version of property A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For uniformly dicrete metric spaces without bounded geometry we suggest a modified version of property A based on metrics of bounded geometry greater than the given metric. We show that this version still implies coarse embeddability in Hilbert spaces, and that some examples of non-property A spaces of unbounded geometry satisfy this version. We also relate this version of property A to our version of uniform Roe algebras for spaces without bounded geometry and introduce an appropriate equivalence relation.</description>
