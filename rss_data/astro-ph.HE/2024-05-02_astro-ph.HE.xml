      <title>Measurement of Milli-Charged Particles with a moderately large cross section from the Earth's core at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is assumed that heavy dark matter $\phi$ with O(TeV) mass captured by the Earth may decay to relativistic light milli-charged particles (MCPs). These MCPs could be measured by the IceCube neutrino telescope. The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs may be evaluated at IceCube. Meanwhile, the numbers of expected neutrino background events were also evaluated at IceCube. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at IceCube in 10 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that the MCPs from the Earth's core could be directly detected at O(1TeV) energies at IceCube when $2\times10^{-5}\lesssim\epsilon^2\lesssim4.5\times10^{-3}$. And a new region of 100 MeV &lt; $m_{MCP}$ &lt; 10 GeV and $4.47\times10^{-3}$ $\lesssim$ $\epsilon$ $\lesssim$ $9.41\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 10 years of IceCube data.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>NICER Discovery of the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SRGA J144459.2-604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery, with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), of the 447.9 Hz accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SRGA J144459.2-604207, which underwent a four-week long outburst starting on 2024 February 15. The AMXP resides in a 5.22 hr binary, orbiting a low-mass companion donor with $M_d&gt;0.1M_\odot$. We report on the temporal and spectral properties from NICER observations during the early days of the outburst, from 2024 February 21 through 2024 February 23, during which NICER also detected a type-I X-ray burst that exhibited a plateau lasting ~6 s. The spectra of the persistent emission were well described by an absorbed thermal blackbody and power-law model, with blackbody temperature $kT\approx0.9{\rm\,keV}$ and power-law photon index $\Gamma\approx1.9$. Time-resolved burst spectroscopy confirmed the thermonuclear nature of the burst, where an additional blackbody component reached a maximum temperature of nearly $kT\approx3{\rm\,keV}$ at the peak of the burst. We discuss the nature of the companion as well as the type-I X-ray burst.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a toroidal magnetic field in the core of 3C 84</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial scales of relativistic radio jets, probed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic jet launching simulations (RMHDs) and by most very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations differ by an order of magnitude. Bridging the gap between these RMHD simulations and VLBI observations requires selecting nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), the parsec-scale region of which can be resolved. 3C 84 is a nearby bright AGN fulfilling the necessary requirements: it is launching a powerful, relativistic jet powered by a central supermassive black hole, while also being very bright. Using 22 GHz global VLBI measurements of 3C 84 we aim to study its sub-parsec region in both total intensity and linear polarisation, to explore the properties of this jet, with a linear resolution of $\sim0.1$ parsec. We test different simulation setups by altering the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the jet, as well as the magnetic field configuration (toroidal, poloidal, helical). We confirm the persistence of a limb brightened structure, which reaches deep into the sub-parsec region. The corresponding electric vector position angles (EVPAs) follow the bulk jet flow inside but tend to be orthogonal to it near the edges. Our state-of-the-art RMHD simulations show that this geometry is consistent with a spine-sheath model, associated with a mildly relativistic flow and a toroidal magnetic field configuration.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Physics of Neutron Stars: A 3D expedition into MAgneto-Thermal evolution in Isolated Neutron Stars with MATINS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis investigates the long-term evolution of the strong magnetic fields within isolated neutron stars (NSs), the most potent magnetic objects in the universe. Their magnetic influence extends beyond their surface to encompass the magnetised plasma in their vicinity. The overarching magnetic configuration significantly impacts the observable characteristics of the highly magnetised NSs, i.e., magnetars. Conversely, the internal magnetic field undergoes prolonged evolution spanning thousands to millions of years, intricately linked to thermal evolution. The diverse observable phenomena associated with NSs underscore the complex 3D nature of their magnetic structure, thereby requiring sophisticated numerical simulations. A central focus of this thesis involves a thorough exploration of state-of-the-art 3D coupled magneto-thermal evolution models. This marks a pioneering achievement as we conduct, for the first time, the most realistic 3D simulations to date, spanning the first million years of a NS's life using the newly developed code MATINS, which adeptly accounts for both Ohmic dissipation and Hall drift within the NS's crust. Our simulations incorporate highly accurate temperature-dependent microphysical calculations and adopt the star's structure based on a realistic equation of state. To address axial singularities in 3D simulations, we employ the cubed-sphere coordinates. We also account for corresponding relativistic factors in the evolution equations and use the latest envelope model from existing literature, in addition to an initial magnetic field structure derived from proton-NS dynamo simulations. Within this framework, we quantitatively simulate the thermal luminosity, timing properties, and magnetic field evolution, pushing the boundaries of numerical modeling capabilities and enabling the performance of several astrophysical studies within this thesis.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Very High Energy {\gamma}-rays in the Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 4278, a Low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), is generally classified as a low-ionization nuclear emission line region (LINER) type AGN. Recently, it is reported to be associated with a very high energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray source 1LHAASO J1219+2915 in the first Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) source catalog. However, no associated counterpart has been detected by Fermi-LAT. By analyzing its X-ray observation data from Swift-XRT, we find it is in a high-flux state on MJD 59546, with the X-ray flux more than one order of magnitude higher than that observed $\sim$ 11.7 year earlier by Chandra. We propose that the detection of VHE $\gamma$-rays from NGC 4278 may be attributed to the presence of an active nucleus displaying behavior similar to that of a BL Lac. To reproduce its spectral energy distribution (SED), we employ a one-zone leptonic model, typically used for fitting broadband SEDs of BL Lacs, and find that smaller values for both Doppler factor ($\delta$) and magnetic field strength ($B$) are required than that of typical TeV BL Lacs. Furthermore, NGC 4278 exhibits significantly lower luminosity in both radio and TeV bands when compared with typical TeV BL Lacs. In the radio-luminosity vs. Eddington-ratio plane, NGC 4278 shows greater similarity to Seyfert galaxies and LINERs rather than BL Lacs; however, it still roughly follows the extension towards lower luminosity seen in BL Lacs.</description>

      <title>Saturation Level of Ion Weibel Instability and Isotropization Length Scale in Electron-Ion Weibel-Mediated Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion Weibel instability is considered to be the dominant physics for the dissipation in high-Mach number astrophysical shocks such as supernova remnant shocks and gamma-ray burst shocks. We study the instability dependence on various parameters using theory and particle-in-cell simulations. We demonstrate that electron physics determines the saturation level of the Weibel-generated magnetic field, even though the instability is driven by the ions. We discuss the application to astrophysical and laboratory laser experiment environments to clarify the roles of the ion Weibel instability. We develop a model for the isotropization length scale in Weibel-mediated shocks and compare its value to other characteristic length scales of each system. We find that electron heating to near equipartition is crucial for the formation of ultra-relativistic Weibel-mediated shocks. On the other hand, our results imply that non-relativistic shocks in typical interstellar medium are not purely mediated by the Weibel instability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Averaging of Radiative Transfer Coefficients for Relativistic Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron emissivities, absorptivities, and Faraday rotation and conversion coefficients are needed in modeling a variety of astrophysical sources, including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) sources. We develop a method for estimating transfer coefficients that exploits their linear dependence on the electron distribution function, decomposing the distribution function into a sum of parts each of whose emissivity can be calculated easily. We refer to this procedure as stochastic averaging and apply it in two contexts. First, we use it to estimate the emissivity of an isotropic $\kappa$ distribution function with a high energy cutoff. The resulting coefficients can be evaluated efficiently enough to be used directly in ray-tracing calculations, and we provide an example calculation. Second, we use stochastic averaging to assess the effect of subgrid turbulence on the volume-averaged emissivity and along the way provide a prescription for a turbulent emissivity. We find that for parameters appropriate to EHT sources turbulence reduces the emissivity slightly. In the infrared turbulence can dramatically increase the emissivity.</description>

      <title>Polarization Perspectives on Hercules X-1: Further Constraining the Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the accreting X-ray pulsar, Hercules X-1, utilizing data from IXPE and NuSTAR. IXPE performed five observations of Her X-1, consisting of three in the Main-on state and two in the Short-on state. Our time-resolved analysis uncovers the linear correlations between the flux and polarization degree as well as the pulse fraction and polarization degree. Geometry parameters are rigorously constrained by fitting the phase-resolved modulations of Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature and polarization angle with a simple dipole model and Rotating Vector Model respectively, yielding roughly consistent results. The changes of $\chi_{\rm p}$ (the position angle of the pulsar's spin axis on the plane of the sky) between different Main-on observations suggest the possible forced precession of the neutron star crust. Furthermore, a linear association between the energy of Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature and polarization angle implies the prevalence of a dominant dipole magnetic field, and their phase-resolved modulations likely arise from viewing angle effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of ultralight black holes depends on whether or not evaporation stops at or around the Planck scale. If evaporation stops, the general expectation is that a population of Planck-scale will be left over, possibly including a significant fraction of electrically charged relics. If evaporation does not stop, a runaway "explosion" would occur, with significant and potentially detectable high-energy emission. Here, I review both possibilities, with an emphasis on current status and future detection prospects.</description>

      <title>Applying the starquake model to study the formation of elastic mountains on spinning neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a neutron star is spun-up or spun-down, the changing strains in its solid elastic crust can give rise to sudden fractures known as starquakes. Early interest in starquakes focused on their possible connection to pulsar glitches. While modern glitch models rely on pinned superfluid vorticity rather than crustal fracture, starquakes may nevertheless play a role in the glitch mechanism. Recently, there has been interest in the issue of starquakes resulting in non-axisymmetric shape changes, potentially linking the quake phenomenon to the building of neutron star mountains, which would then produce continuous gravitational waves. Motivated by this issue, we present a simple model that extends the energy minimisation-based calculations, originally developed to model axisymmetric glitches, to also include non-axisymmetric shape changes. We show that the creation of a mountain in a quake necessarily requires a change in the axisymmetric shape too. We apply our model to the specific problem of the spin-up of an initially non-rotating star, and estimate the maximum mountain that can be built in such a process, subject only to the constraints of energy and angular momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>Resolution analysis of magnetically arrested disk simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarisation measurements by the Event Horizon Telescope from M87$^{\ast}$ and Sgr A$^\ast$ suggest that there is a dynamically strong, ordered magnetic field, typical of what is expected of a magnetically arrested accretion disk (MAD). In such disks the strong poloidal magnetic field can suppress the accretion flow and cause episodic flux eruptions. Recent work shows that General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) MAD simulations feature dynamics of turbulence and mixing instabilities that are becoming resolved at higher resolutions. We perform a convergence study of MADs exceeding the status quo by an order of magnitude in resolution. We use existing 3D simulations performed with the H-AMR code, up to resolution of 5376 x 2304 x 2304 in a logarithmic spherical-polar grid. We find consistent time-averaged disk properties across all resolutions. However, higher resolutions reveal signs of inward angular momentum transport attributed to turbulent convection, particularly evident when mixing instabilities occur at the surfaces of flux tubes during flux eruptions. Additionally, we see wave-like features in the jet sheath, which become more prominent at higher resolutions, that may induce mixing between jet and disk. At higher resolutions, we observe the sheath to be thinner, resulting in increased temperature, reduced magnetisation, and greater variability. Those differences could affect the dissipation of energy, that would eventually result in distinct observable radiative emission from high-resolution simulations. With higher resolutions, we can delve into crucial questions about horizon-scale physics and its impact on the dynamics and emission properties of larger-scale jets.</description>

      <title>Engine-fed Kilonovae (Mergernovae) -- II. Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radioactive power generated by materials within the ejecta of a binary-neutron-star (BNS) merger powers an optical transient known as a kilonova. When the central remnant of a BNS merger is a long-lived magnetar, it continuously produces a highly magnetized wind, altering both the dynamics and temperature of the ejecta, leading to the expected emergence of an engine-fed kilonova. In the first paper of this series, we conducted a detailed study of the dynamics of wind-ejecta interaction and the efficiency of energy injection through shocks. In this work, we combine this dynamical evolution with both shock-heating and additional X-ray irradiation to model photon diffusion within a constant-opacity ejecta. By calculating the radiation, we obtain the light curve and spectral energy distribution (SED). Our findings reveal that, with energy injection, a blue bump typically appears in the early stages ($\lesssim 1$ day). Furthermore, if the magnetar has not spun down by that time, a brightening in the later stages occurs. Despite this, in a large parameter space, the expected luminosity of the engine-fed kilonova is not significantly higher than the typical r-process kilonova due to limited heating efficiency. The SED of engine-fed kilonovae peaks in the relatively blue band in the early stages and evolves towards the red, but at a slower rate compared to the typical r-process kilonova.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stars as a Means of Rapid Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations demonstrate that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist by redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$, providing further evidence for "direct collapse" black hole (BH) formation, whereby massive ($\sim 10^{3-5} M_{\odot}$) SMBH seeds are generated within a few Myr as a byproduct of the rapid inflow of gas into the centers of protogalaxies. Here we analyze the intermediate "quasi-star" phase that accompanies some direct collapse models, during which a natal BH accretes mass from and energetically sustains (through accretion) an overlying gaseous envelope. We argue that previous estimates of the maximum BH mass that can be reached during this stage, $\sim 1\%$ of the total quasi-star mass, are unphysical, and arise from underestimating the efficiency with which energy can be transported outward from regions close to the BH. We construct new quasi-star models that consist of an inner, "saturated-convection" region (which conforms to a convection-dominated accretion flow near the BH) matched to an outer, adiabatic envelope. These solutions exist up to a BH mass of $\sim 60\%$ the total quasi-star mass, at which point the adiabatic envelope contains only 2\% of the mass (with the remaining $\sim 38\%$ in the saturated-convection region), and this upper limit is reached within a time of $20-40$ Myr. We conclude that quasi-stars remain a viable route for producing SMBHs at large redshifts, consistent with recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble Space Telescope has devoted 500 orbits to observing 250 massive stars with low metallicity in the ultraviolet (UV) range within the framework of the ULLYSES program. The X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) project enhances the legacy value of this UV dataset by providing high-quality optical and near-infrared spectra, which are acquired using the wide-wavelength-coverage X-shooter spectrograph at ESO's Very Large Telescope. XShootU emphasises the importance of combining UV with optical spectra for the consistent determination of key stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, abundances, and wind characteristics including mass-loss rates as a function of metallicity. Since uncertainties in these parameters have implications across various branches of astrophysics, the data and modelling generated by the XShootU project are poised to significantly advance our understanding of massive stars at low metallicity. This is particularly crucial for confidently interpreting JWST data of the earliest stellar generations, making XShootU a unique resource for comprehending individual spectra of low-metallicity stars.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray-Boosted Dark Matter at IceCube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) upscattering of dark matter is considered as one of the most straightforward mechanisms to accelerate ambient dark matter, making it detectable at high threshold, large volume experiments. In this work, we revisit CR upscattered dark matter signals at the IceCube detector, focusing on lower energy data than was considered before. We consider both scattering with electrons and nuclei. In the latter, we include both elastic and deep-inelastic scattering computations. As concrete examples, we consider two benchmark models; Fermion dark matter with vector and scalar mediators. We compare our model projections with the most current constraints and show that the IceCube detector can detect CR-boosted dark matter especially with masses below $\sim$ 100 keV when scattering with electrons and $\sim$ MeV in the nucleon scattering case.</description>

      <title>The Extremely Metal-Poor SN 2023ufx: A Local Analog to High-Redshift Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ufx which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to-date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity ($Z_{\rm host} \sim 0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf ($M_g = -13.23\pm0.15$~mag; $r_e\sim 1$~kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at $M_g\approx -18.5~$mag, and shows rapid evolution. The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the pre-explosion mass-loss rate to $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$/yr. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$. The semi-nebular ($\sim 60-130~$d) spectra reveal weak Fe II, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti II, Sc II, Ba II) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad ($\approx 10^4~\rm{km}~\rm s^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\gamma$ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly-rotating progenitors which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole probes of heavy neutral leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH), while still constituting a viable dark matter component, are expected to evaporate through Hawking radiation. Assuming the semi-classical approximation holds up to near the Planck scale, PBHs are expected to evaporate by the present time, emitting a significant flux of particles in their final moments, if produced in the early Universe with an initial mass of $\sim 10^{15}$ g. These ''exploding'' black holes will release a burst of Standard Model particles alongside any additional degrees of freedom, should they exist. We explore the possibility that heavy neutral leptons (HNL), mixing with active neutrinos, are emitted in the final evaporation stages. We calculate the expected number of active neutrinos from such an event, including contributions due to the HNL decay for different assumptions on the mixings. We infer sensitivities on the active-sterile neutrino mixing and on the sterile neutrino mass, finding that, for instance, for the scenario where $U_{\tau 4}\neq 0$, IceCube could improve current constraints by $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude, for HNLs masses between 0.1 - 1 GeV, for a PBH at a distance of $\sim 10^{-4}$ pc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Supernova limits on 'QCD axion-like particles'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the phenomenology of massive Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to quarks and gluons, dubbed 'QCD ALPs', with an emphasis on the associated low-energy observables. ALPs coupled to gluons and quarks not only induce nuclear interactions at scales below the QCD-scale, relevant for ALP production in supernovae (SNe), but naturally also couple to photons similarly to the QCD-axion. We discuss the link between the high-energy formulation of ALP theories and their effective couplings with nucleons and photons. The induced photon coupling allows ALPs with masses $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV to efficiently decay into photons, and astrophysical observables severely constrain the ALP parameter space. We show that a combination of arguments related to SN events rule out ALP-nucleon couplings down to $g_{aN}\gtrsim 10^{-11}- 10^{-10}$ for $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV - a region of the parameter space that was hitherto unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Constraining the giant radio galaxy population with machine learning and Bayesian inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale sky surveys at low frequencies, like the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), allow for the detection and characterisation of unprecedented numbers of giant radio galaxies (GRGs, or 'giants'). In this work, by automating the creation of radio--optical catalogues, we aim to significantly expand the census of known giants. We then combine this sample with a forward model to constrain GRG properties of cosmological interest. In particular, we automate radio source component association through machine learning and optical host identification for resolved radio sources. We create a radio--optical catalogue for the full LoTSS Data Release 2 (DR2) and select all possible giants. We combine our candidates with an existing catalogue of LoTSS DR2 crowd-sourced GRG candidates and visually confirm or reject them. To infer intrinsic GRG properties from GRG observations, we develop further a population-based forward model that takes into account selection effects and constrain its parameters using Bayesian inference. We confirm 5,647 previously unknown giants from the crowd-sourced catalogue and 2,597 previously unknown giants from the ML-driven catalogue. Our confirmations and discoveries bring the total number of known giants to at least 11,585. We predict a comoving GRG number density $n_\mathrm{GRG} = 13 \pm 10\ (100\ \mathrm{Mpc})^{-3}$, close to a recent estimate of the number density of luminous non-giant radio galaxies. We derive a current-day GRG lobe volume-filling fraction $V_\mathrm{GRG-CW}(z = 0) = 1.4 \pm 1.1 \cdot 10^{-5}$ in clusters and filaments of the Cosmic Web. Our analysis suggests that giants are more common than previously thought. Moreover, tentative results imply that it is possible that magnetic fields once contained in giants pervade a significant ($\gtrsim 10\%$) fraction of today's Cosmic Web.</description>

      <title>Migration of Accreting Planets and Black Holes in Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk (PPD) via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in AGN disks. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, in all of our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($\Delta\dot M$ and $\Delta\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that extra caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.</description>

      <title>JWST meets Chandra: a large population of Compton thick, feedback-free, and X-ray weak AGN, with a sprinkle of SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the X-ray properties of a large sample of 71 broad line and narrow line AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;11 discovered by JWST in the GOODS fields, which have the deepest Chandra observations ever obtained. Despite the widespread presence of AGN signatures in their rest-optical and -UV spectra, the vast majority of them is X-ray undetected. The stacked X-ray data of the non-detected sources also results in a non-detection. The upper limit on the X-ray emission for many of these AGN is one or even two orders of magnitude lower than expected from a standard AGN SED. Heavy X-ray absorption by clouds with large (Compton thick) column density and low dust content, such as the Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds, can explain the X-ray weakness. In this scenario the BLR covering factor should be much larger than in low-z AGN or luminous quasar; this is supported by the larger equivalent width of the broad component of Halpha in JWST-selected AGN. We also find that the JWST-discovered AGN lack the prominent, fast outflows characterizing low-z AGN and luminous quasars, suggesting that, in JWST-selected AGN, dense gas lingers in the nuclear region, resulting in large covering factors. We also note that a large fraction of JWST-selected AGN match the definition of NLSy1, typically characterized by a steep X-ray spectrum, and this can further contribute to their observed weakness at high-z. Finally, we discuss that the broad Balmer lines used to identify type 1 AGN cannot be ascribed to Very Massive Stars, Tidal Disruption Events, or Supernovae, although we show that a minority of the faintest broad lines could potentially be associated with the echo of superluminous SNe or TDE. Scenarios in which the broad lines are ascribed to galactic outflows are also untenable. We emphasize that confirming any of the scenarios discussed above will require X-ray missions more sensitive than Chandra. (abridged)</description>

      <title>X-ray spectral properties of dust-obscured galaxies in the XMM-SERVS coverage of the XMM-LSS field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an aim to unveil the population of obscured AGN hosted in high-$z$ dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs), we performed X-ray spectral study of $34$ DOGs ($0.59$ $\leq$ $z$ $\leq$ $4.65$) lying within $5.3$ deg$^{2}$ of the XMM-SERVS coverage in the XMM-LSS field. To improve the spectral quality of individual sources, we combined all the existing $\textit{XMM-Newton}$ data and also included $\textit{Chandra}$/ACIS data, whenever available. We find that the X-ray spectra of our DOGs can be fitted with a simple absorbed power law or with a physically-motivated BORUS02 model. The line-of-sight column densities ($N_{\textrm{H}}$) in our sources span across a wide range ($1.02$ $\times$ $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ $\leq$ $N_{\textrm{H}}$ $\leq$ $1.21$ $\times$ $10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$), with a substantial fraction ($\sim$ $17.6$ per cent) of them being heavily obscured ($N_{\textrm{H}}$ $\geq$ $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). We also identified one new CT-AGN candidate, yielding the CT-AGN fraction in our sample to be only $3$ per cent. The absorption-corrected $2.0-10$ keV X-ray luminosities of our sources ($2.00~\times~10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\leq$ $L_{\textrm{2-10 keV}}^{\textrm{int}}$ $\leq$ $6.17~\times~10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) suggest them to be luminous quasars. The $N_{\textrm{H}}$ versus Eddington ratio diagnostic plot infers that our sample consists of a heterogeneous population that includes a small fraction ($\sim$ $12$ per cent) of DOGs belonging to an early phase (Hot DOGs) during which accretion and obscuration peaks, while the remaining DOGs belong to an intermediate or late phase during which radiative feedback from the dominant AGN blows away surrounding obscuring material.</description>

Abstract: Galactic and extragalactic objects in the universe are sources of high-energy neutrinos {that may contribute to the astrophysical neutrino signal seen by IceCube.} Recently, a study done using cascade-like events seen by IceCube reported neutrino emission from the Galactic plane with $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance. In this work, we put a lower limit on the number of Galactic sources required to explain this emission. To achieve this, we {use} a simulation package created to simulate point sources in the Galaxy along with the neutrino and gamma-ray flux emissions originating from them. Along with {using} past IceCube discovery potential curves, we also account for Eddington bias effects due to Poisson fluctuations in the number of detected neutrino events.{We present a toy Monte Carlo simulation to show that there should be at least 8 sources, each with luminosities $1.6 \times 10^{35}$erg/s responsible for the Galactic neutrino emission. } Our results constrain the number of individual point-like emission regions, which applies both to discrete astrophysical sources and to individual points of diffuse emission.</description>

      <title>Modified temperature redshift relation and UHECR propagation</title>

Abstract: We re-examine the interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with photons from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) under a changed, locally non-linear temperature redshift relation $T(z)$. This changed temperature redshift relation has recently been suggested by the postulate of subjecting thermalised and isotropic photon gases such as the CMB to an SU(2) rather than a U(1) gauge group. This modification of $\Lambda$CDM is called SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$, and some cosmological parameters obtained by SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$ seem to be in better agreement with local measurements of the same quantities, in particular $H_0$ and S$_8$. In this work, we apply the reduced CMB photon density under SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$ to the propagation of UHECRs. This leads to a higher UHECR flux just below the ankle in the cosmic ray spectrum and slightly more cosmogenic neutrinos under otherwise equal conditions for emission and propagation. Most prominently, the proton flux is significantly increased below the ankle ($5\times10^{18}$ eV) for hard injection spectra and without considering the effects of magnetic fields. The reduction in CMB photon density also favours a decreased cosmic ray source evolution than the best fit using $\Lambda$CDM. In consequence, it seems that SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$ favours sources that evolve as the star formation rate (SFR), like starburst galaxies (SBG) and gamma-ray bursts (GRB), over active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as origins of UHECRs. We conclude that the question about the nature of primary sources of UHECRs is directly affected by the assumed temperature redshift relation of the CMB.</description>

      <title>X-ray and Radio Monitoring of the Neutron Star Low Mass X-ray Binary 1A 1744-361: Quasi Periodic Oscillations, Transient Ejections, and a Disk Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on X-ray (NICER/NuSTAR/MAXI/Swift) and radio (MeerKAT) timing and spectroscopic analysis from a three-month monitoring campaign in 2022 of a high-intensity outburst of the dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 1A 1744-361. The 0.5-6.8 keV NICER X-ray hardness-intensity and color-color diagrams of the observations throughout the outburst suggests that 1A 1744-361 spent most of its outburst in an atoll-state, but we show that the source exhibited Z-state-like properties at the peak of the outburst, similar to a small sample of other atoll-state sources. A timing analysis with NICER data revealed several instances of an $\approx8$ Hz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO; fractional rms amplitudes of ~5%) around the peak of the outburst, the first from this source, which we connect to the normal branch QPOs (NBOs) seen in the Z-state. Our observations of 1A 1744-361 are fully consistent with the idea of the mass accretion rate being the main distinguishing parameter between atoll- and Z-states. Radio monitoring data by MeerKAT suggests that the source was at its radio-brightest during the outburst peak, and that the source transitioned from the 'island' spectral state to the 'banana' state within ~3 days of the outburst onset, launching transient jet ejecta. The observations present the strongest evidence for radio flaring, including jet ejecta, during the island-to-banana spectral state transition at low accretion rates (atoll-state). The source also exhibited Fe XXV, Fe XXVI K$\alpha$, and K$\beta$ X-ray absorption lines, whose origins likely lie in an accretion disk atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: Intensive broadband reverberation mapping campaigns have shown that AGN variability is significantly more complex than expected from disc reverberation of the variable X-ray illumination. The UV/optical variability is highly correlated and lagged, with longer lags at longer wavelengths as predicted, but the observed timescales are longer than expected. Worse, the UV/optical lightcurves are not well correlated with the X-rays which should drive them. Instead, we consider an intrinsically variable accretion disc, where slow mass accretion rate fluctuations are generated in the optical-UV disc, propagating down to modulate intrinsically faster X-ray variability from the central regions. We match our model to Fairall 9, a well studied AGN with $L \sim 0.1L_{\rm{Edd}}$, where the spectrum is dominated by the UV/EUV. Our model produces lightcurves where the X-rays and UV have very different fast variability, yet are well correlated on longer timescales, as observed. It predicts that the intrinsic variability has optical/UV leading the X-rays, but including reverberation of the variable EUV from an inner wind produces a lagged bound-free continuum which matches the observed UV-optical lags. We conclude that optical/UV AGN variability is likely driven by intrinsic fluctuations within the disc, not X-ray reprocessing: the observed longer than expected lags are produced by reverberation of the EUV illuminating a wind not by X-ray illumination of the disc: the increasing lag with increasing wavelength is produced by the increased contribution of the (constant lag) bound-free continuum to the spectrum, rather than indicating intrinsically larger reverberation distances for longer wavelengths.</description>

      <title>A Millisecond Pulsar Binary Embedded in a Galactic Center Radio Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic Center is host to a population of extraordinary radio filaments, thin linear structures that trace out magnetic field lines running perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Using Murriyang, the 64 m Parkes radio telescope, we conducted a search for pulsars centered on the position of a compact source in the filament G359.0$-$0.2. We discovered a millisecond pulsar (MSP), PSR J1744$-$2946, with a period $P = 8.4$ ms, that is bound in a 4.8 hr circular orbit around a $M_{\rm c} &gt; 0.05\,M_{\odot}$ companion. The pulsar dispersion measure of $673.7 \pm 0.1$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and Faraday rotation measure of $3011 \pm 3$ rad m$^{-2}$ are the largest of any known MSP. Its radio pulses are moderately scattered due to multi-path propagation through the interstellar medium, with a scattering timescale of $0.87 \pm 0.08$ ms at 2.6 GHz. Using MeerKAT, we localized the pulsar to a point source embedded in a low-luminosity radio filament, the "Sunfish", that is unrelated to G359.0$-$0.2. Our discovery of the first MSP within 1$^{\circ}$ of the Galactic Center hints at a large population of these objects detectable via high frequency surveys. The association with a filament points to pulsars as the energy source responsible for illuminating the Galactic Center radio filaments.</description>

      <title>On the calibration of ultra-high energy EASs at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analysis of calibrations of extensive air showers with zenith angles $\theta \le 50^{\circ}$ and energies $E_{\text{SD}} \ge 10^{18.5}$ eV was carried out in experiments at the Yakutsk array and Telescope Array. The values of $E_{\text{SD}}$ were determined from particle densities measured with ground-based scintillation detectors at a distance $r = 800$ m from shower axis. Measured densities were compared with the values obtained in simulations preformed with the use of CORSIKA code within the framework of QGSJet-II.04 hadron interaction model for primary protons. For showers with $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ the $E_{\text{SD}}$ estimates of both arrays are very close, and their energy spectra are similar in shape and absolute value. Another Telescope Array calibration, based on measuring the EAS fluorescent radiation with optical detectors, gives underestimated energy $E_{\text{FD}} = 0.787 \times E_{\text{SD}}$.</description>

      <title>SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621: Rising Ionization in a Nearby, CSM-Interacting Type II Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present UV/optical/NIR observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r &lt; 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.</description>

      <title>A novel energy reconstruction method for the MAGIC stereoscopic observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new gamma ray energy reconstruction method based on Random Forest to be commonly used for the data analysis of the MAGIC Telescopes, a system of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes.
  The energy resolution with the new energy reconstruction improves compared to the one obtained with the LUTs method. For standard observations i.e. dark conditions with pointing zenith (Zd) less than 35 deg for a point-like source, the energy resolution goes from $\sim 20\%$ at 100 GeV to $\sim 10\%$ at a few TeV.
  In addition, the new method suppresses the outlier population in the energy error distribution, which is thus better described by a Gaussian distribution. The new energy reconstruction method enhances the reliability especially for the sources with steep spectra, in higher energies and/or in observations at higher Zd pointings.
  We validate the new method in different ways and demonstrate some cases of its remarkable benefit in spectral analysis with simulated observation data.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations of Hybrid Stars and Neutron Stars including Delta baryons: The Effect of a Slow Quark Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study radial oscillations of hybrid neutron stars composed of hadronic external layers followed by a quark matter core. We employ a density-dependent relativistic mean-field model including hyperons and ${\Delta}$ baryons to describe hadronic matter, and a density-dependent quark model for quark matter. We obtain the ten lowest eigenfrequencies and the corresponding oscillation functions of N, N+${\Delta}$, N+H, and N+H+${\Delta}$ equations-of-state with a phase transition to the quark matter at 1.4 and 1.8 ${M_{\odot}}$, focusing on the effects of a slow phase transition at the hadron-quark interface. We observe that the maximum mass is reached before the fundamental mode's frequency vanishes for slow phase transitions, suggesting that some stellar configurations with higher central densities than the maximum mass remain stable even when they undergo small radial perturbations. Future gravitational wave detectors and multi-messenger astronomy, complemented by robust microscopic models enabling exploration of various neutron star compositions, including hyperon content, are anticipated to impose precise limitations on the equation of state of baryonic matter under high-density conditions.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array source ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background for pulsar timing arrays is often modeled by a Gaussian ensemble which is isotropic and unpolarized. However, the Universe has a discrete set of polarized gravitational wave sources at specific sky locations. Can we trust that the Gaussian ensemble is an accurate description? To investigate this, we explicitly construct an ensemble containing $N$ individual binary sources with circular orbits. The orbital inclination angles are randomly distributed, hence the individual sources are elliptically polarized. We then compute the first two moments of the Hellings and Downs correlation, as well as the pulsar-averaged correlation mean and (cosmic) variance. The first moments are the same as for a previously studied ensemble of circularly polarized sources. However, the second moments, and hence the variances, are different for the two ensembles. While neither discrete source model is exactly described by a Gaussian ensemble, we show that in the limit of large $N$, the differences are small.</description>
