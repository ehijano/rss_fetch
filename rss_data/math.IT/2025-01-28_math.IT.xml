      <title>On strict ranking by pairwise comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attack the problem of getting a strict ranking (i.e. a ranking without equally ranked items) of $n$ items from a pairwise comparisons matrix. Basic structures are described, a first heuristical approach based on a condition, the $\mathcal{R}-$condition, is proposed. Analyzing the limits of this ranking procedure, we finish with a minimization problem which can be applied to a wider class of pairwise comparisons matrices. If solved, it produces consistent pairwise comparisons that produce a strict ranking.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Unfolding-Optimized Coordinate-Descent Data-Detector ASIC for mmWave Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 22 nm FD-SOI (fully depleted silicon-on-insulator) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation of a novel soft-output Gram-domain block coordinate descent (GBCD) data detector for massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The ASIC simultaneously addresses the high throughput requirements for millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, stringent area and power budget per subcarrier in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and error-rate performance challenges posed by realistic mmWave channels. The proposed GBCD algorithm utilizes a posterior mean estimate (PME) denoiser and is optimized using deep unfolding, which results in superior error-rate performance even in scenarios with highly correlated channels or where the number of user equipment (UE) data streams is comparable to the number of basestation (BS) antennas. The fabricated GBCD ASIC supports up to 16 UEs transmitting QPSK to 256-QAM symbols to a 128-antenna BS, and achieves a peak throughput of 7.1 Gbps at 367 mW. The core area is only 0.97 mm$^2$ thanks to a reconfigurable array of processing elements that enables extensive resource sharing. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed GBCD data-detector ASIC achieves best-in-class throughput and area efficiency.</description>

      <title>Achieving uniform side information gain with multilevel lattice codes over the ring of integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The index coding problem aims to optimise broadcast communication by taking advantage of receiver-side information to improve transmission efficiency. In this letter, we explore the application of Construction $\pi_A$ lattices to index coding. We introduce a coding scheme, named \textit{CRT lattice index coding}, using Construction $\pi_A$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ to address the index coding problem. It is derived an upper bound for side information gain of a CRT lattice index code and conditions for the uniformity of this gain. The efficiency of this approach is shown through theoretical analysis and code design examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a 2-users weak Gaussian interference channel is achieved using Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Efficient Capacity Region for Multi-User Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capacity region of multi-user interference channels (IC), where each user encodes multiple sub-user components. By unifying chain-rule decomposition with the Entropy Power Inequality (EPI), we reason that single-user Gaussian codebooks suffice to achieve optimal performance, thus obviating any need for intricate auxiliary variables or joint typicality arguments. Our partial-MAC formulation enumerates sub-user decoding orders while only imposing constraints for sub-users actually decoded. This significantly reduces complexity relative to enumerating all subsets or bruteforcing over all successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order combinations at all receivers. This leads to a finite but comprehensive construction of all achievable rate tuples under sum-power constraints, while guaranteeing that each receiver fully recovers its intended sub-user signals. Consequently, known single-user Gaussian capacity results generalize naturally to multi-user scenarios, revealing a cohesive framework for analyzing multi-user IC. Our results thus offer a streamlined, tractable pathway for designing next-generation cell-free wireless networks that rely on IC mechanisms, efficiently exploiting interference structure while minimizing overhead. Overall, this provides a unifying perspective.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficiency Maximization in RSMA-IRS-Assisted ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a three-dimensional (3D) geometry-based channel model to accurately represent intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks using rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in practical urban environments. Based on this model, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that incorporates transceiver beamforming constraints, IRS phase adjustments, and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements to optimize communication and sensing functions. To solve this problem, we use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm within a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Our numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving EE and satisfying QoS requirements. Additionally, we observe that system EE drops at higher frequencies, especially under double-Rayleigh fading.</description>

      <title>A* Based Algorithm for Reduced Complexity ML Decoding of Tailbiting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The A* algorithm is a graph search algorithm which has shown good results in terms of computational complexity for Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding of tailbiting convolutional codes. The decoding of tailbiting codes with this algorithm is performed in two phases. In the first phase, a typical Viterbi decoding is employed to collect information regarding the trellis. The A* algorithm is then applied in the second phase, using the information obtained in the first one to calculate the heuristic function. The improvements proposed in this work decrease the computational complexity of the A* algorithm using further information from the first phase of the algorithm. This information is used for obtaining a more accurate heuristic function and finding early terminating conditions for the A* algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed modifications decrease the complexity of ML decoding with the A* algorithm in terms of the performed number of operations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of optimizing the capacity-achieving input distribution for a multinomial channel under the constraint of limited input support size, which is a crucial aspect in the design of DNA storage systems. We propose an algorithm that further elaborates the Multidimensional Dynamic Assignment Blahut-Arimoto (M-DAB) algorithm. Our proposed algorithm integrates variational autoencoder for determining the optimal locations of input distribution, into the alternating optimization of the input distribution locations and weights.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Near/Far-Field Frequency-Dependent Beamforming via Joint Phase-Time Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint phase-time arrays (JPTA) emerge as a cost-effective and energy-efficient architecture for frequency-dependent beamforming in wideband communications by utilizing both true-time delay units and phase shifters. This paper exploits the potential of JPTA to simultaneously serve multiple users in both near- and far-field regions with a single radio frequency chain. The goal is to jointly optimize JPTA-based beamforming and subband allocation to maximize overall system performance. To this end, we formulate a system utility maximization problem, including sum-rate maximization and proportional fairness as special cases. We develop a 3-step alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and an efficient deep learning (DL) method for this problem. The DL approach includes a 2-layer convolutional neural network, a 3-layer graph attention network (GAT), and a normalization module for resource and beamforming optimization. The GAT efficiently captures the interactions between resource allocation and analog beamformers. Simulation results confirm that JPTA outperforms conventional phased arrays (PA) in enhancing user rate and strikes a good balance between PA and fully-digital approach in energy efficiency. Employing a logarithmic utility function for user rates ensures greater fairness than maximizing sum-rates. Furthermore, the DL network achieves comparable performance to the AO approach, while having orders of magnitude lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis of tail-minimization and the linear rate of convergence of a proximal algorithm for sparse signal recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovery error bounds of tail-minimization and the rate of convergence of an efficient proximal alternating algorithm for sparse signal recovery are considered in this article. Tail-minimization focuses on minimizing the energy in the complement $T^c$ of an estimated support $T$. Under the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition, we prove that tail-$\ell_1$ minimization can exactly recover sparse signals in the noiseless case for a given $T$. In the noisy case, two recovery results for the tail-$\ell_1$ minimization and the tail-lasso models are established. Error bounds are improved over existing results. Additionally, we show that the RIP condition becomes surprisingly relaxed, allowing the RIP constant to approach $1$ as the estimation $T$ closely approximates the true support $S$. Finally, an efficient proximal alternating minimization algorithm is introduced for solving the tail-lasso problem using Hadamard product parametrization. The linear rate of convergence is established using the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves signal recovery performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Detecting Unauthorized Drones with Cell-Free Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) boosts network efficiency by using existing resources for diverse sensing applications. In this work, we propose a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output)-ISAC framework to detect unauthorized drones while simultaneously ensuring communication requirements. We develop a detector to identify passive aerial targets by analyzing signals from distributed access points (APs). In addition to the precision of the sensing, timeliness of the sensing information is also crucial due to the risk of drones leaving the area before the sensing procedure is finished. We introduce the age of sensing (AoS) and sensing coverage as our sensing performance metrics and propose a joint sensing blocklength and power optimization algorithm to minimize AoS and maximize sensing coverage while meeting communication requirements. Moreover, we propose an adaptive weight selection algorithm based on concave-convex procedure to balance the inherent trade-off between AoS and sensing coverage. Our numerical results show that increasing the communication requirements would significantly reduce both the sensing coverage and the timeliness of the sensing. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive weight selection algorithm can provide high sensing coverage and reduce the AoS by 45% compared to the fixed weights, demonstrating efficient utilization of both power and sensing blocklength.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a separable design for computing information measures, where the information measure is computed from learned feature representations instead of raw data. Under mild assumptions on the feature representations, we demonstrate that a class of information measures admit such separable computation, including mutual information, $f$-information, Wyner's common information, G{\'a}cs--K{\"o}rner common information, and Tishby's information bottleneck. Our development establishes several new connections between information measures and the statistical dependence structure. The characterizations also provide theoretical guarantees of practical designs for estimating information measures through representation learning.</description>

      <title>Qualitative Mechanism Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define what it means for a joint probability distribution to be compatible with a set of independent causal mechanisms, at a qualitative level -- or, more precisely, with a directed hypergraph ${\mathcal{A}}$, which is the qualitative structure of a probabilistic dependency graph (PDG). When ${\mathcal{A}}$ represents a qualitative Bayesian network, QIM-compatibility with ${\mathcal{A}}$ reduces to satisfying the appropriate conditional independencies. But giving semantics to hypergraphs using QIM-compatibility lets us do much more. For one thing, we can capture functional dependencies. For another, we can capture important aspects of causality using compatibility: we can use compatibility to understand cyclic causal graphs, and to demonstrate structural compatibility, we must essentially produce a causal model. Finally, QIM-compatibility has deep connections to information theory. Applying our notion to cyclic structures helps to clarify a longstanding conceptual issue in information theory.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Surface Assisted Radar Stealth Against Unauthorized ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of radar sensors and communication networks as envisioned for the 6G wireless networks poses significant security risks, e.g., the user position information can be released to an unauthorized dual-functional base station (DFBS). To address this issue, we propose an intelligent surface (IS)-assisted radar stealth technology that prevents adversarial sensing. Specifically, we modify the wireless channels by tuning the phase shifts of IS in order to protect the target user from unauthorized sensing without jeopardizing the wireless communication link. In principle, we wish to maximize the distortion between the estimated angle-of-arrival (AoA) by the DFBS and the ground truth given the minimum signal-to-noise-radio (SNR) constraint for communication. Toward this end, we propose characterizing the problem as a game played by the DFBS and the IS, in which the DFBS aims to maximize a particular utility while the IS aims to minimize the utility. Although the problem is nonconvex, this paper shows that it can be optimally solved in closed form from a geometric perspective. According to the simulations, the proposed closed-form algorithm outperforms the baseline methods significantly in combating unauthorized sensing while limiting the impacts on wireless communications.</description>

      <title>First Real-Time Detection of Ambient Backscatters using Uplink Sounding Reference Signals of a Commercial 4G Smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, cellular Ambient Backscattering has been proposed for 4G/5G/6G networks. An Ambient backscatter tag broadcasts its message by backscattering ambient downlink waves from the closest base station according to a predefined pattern. A tag is detected by smartphones nearby. This paper presents, for the first time, a novel ambient backscatter communication system exploiting uplink ambient waves from smartphones instead of downlink waves. In this novel system, the base station connected to a smartphone monitors the uplink pilot signals and detects tags in proximity. The proposed system is implemented and tested with prototypes of tags, a commercial 4G smartphone and a 4G Software Defined Radio base station. At the base station side, a non-coherent correlator receiver is implemented, and a novel technique based on pre-correlation data processing is proposed to separate useful variations on pilot signals due to tags from variations due to time varying channel effects. To deal with collision between multiple tags, distinct Gold pseudo noise codes with minimum cross correlation are used. Tests are run in different indoor and outdoor environments. A receiver detection probability of 95% has been achieved at 0.5% False-alarm probability when the tag is at 5 meters from the UE. At the refresh rate of 2 seconds, the proposed scheme is suitable for tracking objects at moderate speeds and can therefore be used for many passive IoT-based applications.</description>

      <title>Individual Confidential Computing of Polynomials over Non-Uniform Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of secure distributed computation in scenarios where user data is not uniformly distributed, extending existing frameworks that assume uniformity, an assumption that is challenging to enforce in data for computation. Motivated by the pervasive reliance on single service providers for data storage and computation, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme that achieves information-theoretic security guarantees for computing polynomials over non-uniform data distributions. Our framework builds upon the concept of perfect subset privacy and employs linear hashing techniques to transform non-uniform data into approximately uniform distributions, enabling robust and secure computation. We derive leakage bounds and demonstrate that information leakage of any subset of user data to untrusted service providers, i.e., not only to colluding workers but also (and more importantly) to the admin, remains negligible under the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Rate Distortion Approach to Joint Communication and Sensing With Markov States: Open Loop Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) framework in which a transmitter concurrently transmits information to a receiver and estimates a state of interest based on noisy observations. The state is assumed to evolve according to a known dynamical model. Past state estimates may then be used to inform current state estimates. We show that Bayesian filtering constitutes the optimal sensing strategy. We analyze JCAS performance under an open loop encoding strategy with results presented in terms of the tradeoff between asymptotic communication rate and expected per-block distortion of the state. We illustrate the general result by specializing the analysis to a beam-pointing model with mobile state tracking. Our results shed light on the relative performance of two beam control strategies, beam-switching and multi-beam.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Decoding for Communication Channels Governed by Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital communication systems inherently operate through physical media governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we introduce a physics-aware decoding framework that integrates gradient descent-based error correcting algorithms with PDE-based channel modeling using differentiable PDE solvers. At the core of our approach is gradient flow decoding, which harnesses gradient information directly from the PDE solver to guide the decoding process. We validate our method through numerical experiments on both the heat equation and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE), demonstrating significant improvements in decoding performance. The implications of this work extend beyond decoding applications, establishing a new paradigm for physics-aware signal processing that shows promise for various signal detection and signal recovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Vision-Aided Channel Prediction Based on Image Segmentation at Street Intersection Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent vehicular communication with vehicle road collaboration capability is a key technology enabled by 6G, and the integration of various visual sensors on vehicles and infrastructures plays a crucial role. Moreover, accurate channel prediction is foundational to realizing intelligent vehicular communication. Traditional methods are still limited by the inability to balance accuracy and operability based on substantial spectrum resource consumption and highly refined description of environment. Therefore, leveraging out-of-band information introduced by visual sensors provides a new solution and is increasingly applied across various communication tasks. In this paper, we propose a computer vision (CV)-based prediction model for vehicular communications, realizing accurate channel characterization prediction including path loss, Rice K-factor and delay spread based on image segmentation. First, we conduct extensive vehicle-to-infrastructure measurement campaigns, collecting channel and visual data from various street intersection scenarios. The image-channel dataset is generated after a series of data post-processing steps. Image data consists of individual segmentation of target user using YOLOv8 network. Subsequently, established dataset is used to train and test prediction network ResNet-32, where segmented images serve as input of network, and various channel characteristics are treated as labels or target outputs of network. Finally, self-validation and cross-validation experiments are performed. The results indicate that models trained with segmented images achieve high prediction accuracy and remarkable generalization performance across different streets and target users. The model proposed in this paper offers novel solutions for achieving intelligent channel
  prediction in vehicular communications.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Non-Stationary Markov Tapped Delay Line Channel Model for 5G-Railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G for Railways (5G-R) is globally recognized as a promising next-generation railway communication system designed to meet increasing demands. Channel modeling serves as foundation for communication system design, with tapped delay line (TDL) models widely utilized in system simulations due to their simplicity and practicality and serves as a crucial component of various standards like 3GPP. However, existing TDL models applicable to 5G-R systems are limited. Most fail to capture non-stationarity, a critical characteristic of railway communications, while others are unsuitable for the specific frequency bands and bandwidths of 5G-R. In this paper, a channel measurement campaign for 5G-R dedicated network is carried out, resulting in a measurement-based 5-tap TDL model utilizing a first-order two-state Markov chain to represent channel non stationarity. Key model parameters, including number of taps, statistical distribution of amplitude, phase and Doppler shift, and state transition probability matrix, are extracted. The correlation between tap amplitudes are also obtained. Finally, accuracy of model is validated through comparisons with measurement data and 3GPP model. These findings are expected to offer valuable insights for design, optimization, and link-level simulation and validation of 5G-R systems.</description>

      <title>Coding for Strand Breaks in Composite DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even tough DNA can be considered as a very stable long term storage medium, errors must be expected during storage. From experiments it is evident that the most common error type due to storage are strand breaks. We address the problem of correcting strand breaks in DNA sequences resulting from composite DNA synthesis. We introduce a novel channel model with realistic assumptions about the errors resulting from long term storage. Our proposed coding scheme employs marker codes to correct single breaks. For this purpose, we generalize run-length-limited codes for the composite setting and derive bounds on the code size.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: Friends or Foes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are considered promising technologies for the next-generation wireless communication systems due to their shared channel reconfiguration capabilities. This, however, raises a fundamental question: Does the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) still exist in the presence of the IRS? To answer this question, we investigate in this paper an IRS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) MA system, where a multi-MA base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-FPA users. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the active/passive beamforming of the BS/IRS and the MA positions within a one-dimensional transmit region, which is challenging to be optimally solved. To drive essential insights, we first study a simplified case with a single user. Then, we analyze the performance gain of MAs over FPAs in the light-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which this gain becomes more or less significant. In addition, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to solve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem in the single-user case by combining the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and the graph-based method. For the general multi-user case, our performance analysis unveils that the performance gain of MAs over FPAs diminishes with typical transmit precoding strategies at the BS under certain conditions. We also propose a high-quality suboptimal solution to the sum-rate maximization problem by applying the AO algorithm that combines the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, manifold optimization method and discrete sampling method. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate that the performance gain of MAs over FPAs may be reduced if the IRS passive beamforming is optimized.</description>

      <title>Combating Interference for Over-the-Air Federated Learning: A Statistical Approach via RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) integrates analog communication with task-oriented computation, serving as a key enabling technique for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) over wireless networks. However, owing to its analog characteristics, AirComp-enabled FL (AirFL) is vulnerable to both unintentional and intentional interference. In this paper, we aim to attain robustness in AirComp aggregation against interference via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to artificially reconstruct wireless environments. Concretely, we establish performance objectives tailored for interference suppression in wireless FL systems, aiming to achieve unbiased gradient estimation and reduce its mean square error (MSE). Oriented at these objectives, we introduce the concept of phase-manipulated favorable propagation and channel hardening for AirFL, which relies on the adjustment of RIS phase shifts to realize statistical interference elimination and reduce the error variance of gradient estimation. Building upon this concept, we propose two robust aggregation schemes of power control and RIS phase shifts design, both ensuring unbiased gradient estimation in the presence of interference. Theoretical analysis of the MSE and FL convergence affirms the anti-interference capability of the proposed schemes. It is observed that computation and interference errors diminish by an order of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)$ where $N$ is the number of RIS elements, and the ideal convergence rate without interference can be asymptotically achieved by increasing $N$. Numerical results confirm the analytical results and validate the superior performance of the proposed schemes over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Achieving Input Distribution of the Additive Uniform Noise Channel With Peak Amplitude and Cost Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under which condition is quantization optimal? We address this question in the context of the additive uniform noise channel under peak amplitude and power constraints. We compute analytically the capacity-achieving input distribution as a function of the noise level, the average power constraint and the exponent of the power constraint. We found that when the cost constraint is tight and the cost function is concave, the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete, whereas when the cost function is convex, the support of the capacity-achieving input distribution spans the entire interval.</description>

      <title>A Unified Representation of Density-Power-Based Divergences Reducible to M-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-power-based divergences are known to provide robust inference procedures against outliers, and their extensions have been widely studied. A characteristic of successful divergences is that the estimation problem can be reduced to M-estimation. In this paper, we define a norm-based Bregman density power divergence (NB-DPD) -- density-power-based divergence with functional flexibility within the framework of Bregman divergences that can be reduced to M-estimation. We show that, by specifying the function $\phi_\gamma$, NB-DPD reduces to well-known divergences, such as the density power divergence and the $\gamma$-divergence. Furthermore, by examining the combinations of functions $\phi_\gamma$ corresponding to existing divergences, we show that a new divergence connecting these existing divergences can be derived. Finally, we show that the redescending property, one of the key indicators of robustness, holds only for the $\gamma$-divergence.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Assisted Coding for Arbitrary Linear Computations Over a Quantum MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a linear computation problem over a quantum multiple access channel (LC-QMAC), where $S$ servers share an entangled state and separately store classical data streams $W_1,\cdots, W_S$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_d$. A user aims to compute $K$ linear combinations of these data streams, represented as $Y = \mathbf{V}_1 W_1 + \mathbf{V}_2 W_2 + \cdots + \mathbf{V}_S W_S \in \mathbb{F}_d^{K \times 1}$. To this end, each server encodes its classical information into its local quantum subsystem and transmits it to the user, who retrieves the desired computations via quantum measurements. In this work, we propose an achievable scheme for LC-QMAC based on the stabilizer formalism and the ideas from entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECC). Specifically, given any linear computation matrix, we construct a self-orthogonal matrix that can be implemented using the stabilizer formalism. Also, we apply precoding matrices to minimize the number of auxiliary qudits required. Our scheme achieves more computations per qudit, i.e., a higher computation rate, compared to the best-known methods in the literature, and attains the capacity in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Uncoded Download in Lagrange-Coded Elastic Computing with Straggler Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded elastic computing, introduced by Yang et al. in 2018, is a technique designed to mitigate the impact of elasticity in cloud computing systems, where machines can be preempted or be added during computing rounds. This approach utilizes maximum distance separable (MDS) coding for both storage and download in matrix-matrix multiplications. The proposed scheme is unable to tolerate stragglers and has high encoding complexity and upload cost. In 2023, we addressed these limitations by employing uncoded storage and Lagrange-coded download. However, it results in a large storage size. To address the challenges of storage size and upload cost, in this paper, we focus on Lagrange-coded elastic computing based on uncoded download. We propose a new class of elastic computing schemes, using Lagrange-coded storage with uncoded download (LCSUD). Our proposed schemes address both elasticity and straggler challenges while achieving lower storage size, reduced encoding complexity, and upload cost compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Decision Making in Changing Environments: Robustness, Query-Based Learning, and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of interactive decision making in which the underlying environment changes over time subject to given constraints. We propose a framework, which we call \textit{hybrid Decision Making with Structured Observations} (hybrid DMSO), that provides an interpolation between the stochastic and adversarial settings of decision making. Within this framework, we can analyze local differentially private (LDP) decision making, query-based learning (in particular, SQ learning), and robust and smooth decision making under the same umbrella, deriving upper and lower bounds based on variants of the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC). We further establish strong connections between the DEC's behavior, the SQ dimension, local minimax complexity, learnability, and joint differential privacy. To showcase the framework's power, we provide new results for contextual bandits under the LDP constraint.</description>

      <title>The Cloud and Flock Polynomials of q-Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Whitney function of a q-matroid can be determined from the cloud and flock polynomials associated to the cyclic flats. These polynomials capture information about the corank (resp., nullity) of certain spaces whose cyclic core (resp., closure) is the given cyclic flat. Going one step further, we prove that the Whitney function, and in fact all cloud and flock polynomials, are determined by the configuration of the q-matroid, that is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats together with the corank-nullity data. Examples illustrate that the converses of the above statements are not true. This has the consequence that the Whitney function of a direct sum is not determined by the Whitney functions of the summands.</description>

      <title>Cryptanalysis via Machine Learning Based Information Theoretic Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fields of machine learning (ML) and cryptanalysis share an interestingly common objective of creating a function, based on a given set of inputs and outputs. However, the approaches and methods in doing so vary vastly between the two fields. In this paper, we explore integrating the knowledge from the ML domain to provide empirical evaluations of cryptosystems. Particularly, we utilize information theoretic metrics to perform ML-based distribution estimation. We propose two novel applications of ML algorithms that can be applied in a known plaintext setting to perform cryptanalysis on any cryptosystem. We use mutual information neural estimation to calculate a cryptosystem's mutual information leakage, and a binary cross entropy classification to model an indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (CPA). These algorithms can be readily applied in an audit setting to evaluate the robustness of a cryptosystem and the results can provide a useful empirical bound. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodologies by empirically analyzing several encryption schemes. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to novel network coding-based cryptosystems and provide other use cases for our algorithms. We show that our classification model correctly identifies the encryption schemes that are not IND-CPA secure, such as DES, RSA, and AES ECB, with high accuracy. It also identifies the faults in CPA-secure cryptosystems with faulty parameters, such a reduced counter version of AES-CTR. We also conclude that with our algorithms, in most cases a smaller-sized neural network using less computing power can identify vulnerabilities in cryptosystems, providing a quick check of the sanity of the cryptosystem and help to decide whether to spend more resources to deploy larger networks that are able to break the cryptosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new type of link between geometry of symplectic group and entanglement-assisted (EA) quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) is presented. Relations of symplectic subspaces and quaternary additive codes concerning parameters of EAQECCs are described. Thus, parameters of EA stabilizer codes are revealed in the nomenclature of additive codes. Our techniques enable us solve some open problems about optimal EAQECCs and entanglement-assisted quantum minimum distance separable (EAQMDS) codes, and are also useful for designing encoding and decoding quantum circuit of EA stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Information Consistent Pruning: How to Efficiently Search for Sparse Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative magnitude pruning methods (IMPs), proven to be successful in reducing the number of insignificant nodes in over-parameterized deep neural networks (DNNs), have been getting an enormous amount of attention with the rapid deployment of DNNs into cutting-edge technologies with computation and memory constraints. Despite IMPs popularity in pruning networks, a fundamental limitation of existing IMP algorithms is the significant training time required for each pruning iteration. Our paper introduces a novel \textit{stopping criterion} for IMPs that monitors information and gradient flows between networks layers and minimizes the training time. Information Consistent Pruning (\ourmethod{}) eliminates the need to retrain the network to its original performance during intermediate steps while maintaining overall performance at the end of the pruning process. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm is more efficient than current IMPs across multiple dataset-DNN combinations. We also provide theoretical insights into the core idea of our algorithm alongside mathematical explanations of flow-based IMP. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/Sekeh-Lab/InfCoP}.</description>

      <title>Joint Communication and Sensing with Bipartite Entanglement over Bosonic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a joint communication and sensing problem in an optical link in which a low-power transmitter attempts to communicate with a receiver while simultaneously identifying the range of a defect creating a backscattered signal. We model the system as a lossy thermal noise bosonic channel in which the location of the target, modeled as a beamsplitter, affects the timing of the backscattered signal. Motivated by the envisioned deployment of entanglement sharing quantum networks, we allow the transmitter to exploit entanglement to assist its sensing and communication. Since entanglement is known to enhance sensing, as known from quantum illumination, and increase communication rates, as known from the characterization of the entanglement-assisted capacity, the transmitter is faced with a trade-off and must judiciously allocate its entanglement resources. Our main result is a characterization of the trade-offs incurred in the form of an achievable rate/error-exponent region which can beat time-sharing in certain cases. The proof of our result relies on technical results of independent interests, by which we carefully show how to extend the known asymptotic characterization of multi-hypothesis testing Chernoff exponent in finite-dimensional spaces to infinite-dimensional spaces and provide a characterization of phase shift keying modulated displaced thermal states in Fock basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a protocol called ENCORE which simultaneously compresses and encrypts data in a one-pass process that can be implemented efficiently and possesses a number of desirable features as a streaming encoder/decoder. Motivated by the observation that both lossless compression and encryption consist of performing an invertible transformation whose output is close to a uniform distribution over bit streams, we show that these can be done simultaneously, at least for ``typical'' data with a stable distribution, i.e., approximated reasonably well by the output of a Markov model. The strategy is to transform the data into a dyadic distribution whose Huffman encoding is close to uniform, and then store the transformations made to said data in a compressed secondary stream interwoven into the first with a user-defined encryption protocol. The result is an encoding which we show exhibits a modified version of Yao's ``next-bit test'' while requiring many fewer bits of entropy than standard encryption. Numerous open questions remain, particularly regarding results that we suspect can be strengthened considerably.</description>

      <title>Active Hypothesis Testing for Quantum Detection of Phase-Shift Keying Coherent States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum detection of Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)-coded coherent states through the lens of active hypothesis testing, focusing on a Dolinar-like receiver with constraints on displacement amplitude and energy. With coherent state slicing, we formulate the problem as a controlled sensing task in which observation kernels have parameters shrinking with sample size. The constrained open-loop error exponent and a corresponding upper bound on the Bayesian error probability are proven. Surprisingly, the exponent-optimal open-loop policy for binary PSK with high dark counts is not simply time-sharing. This work serves as a first step towards obtaining analytical insights through the active hypothesis testing framework for designing resource-constrained quantum communication receivers.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>The second-order zero differential spectra of some functions over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was shown by Boukerrou et al.~[IACR Trans. Symmetric Cryptol. 1 (2020), 331--362] that the $F$-boomerang uniformity (which is the same as the second-order zero differential uniformity in even characteristic) of perfect nonlinear functions is~$0$ on $\F_{p^n}$ ($p$ prime) and the one of almost perfect nonlinear functions on $\F_{2^n}$ is~$0$. It is natural to inquire what happens with APN or other low differential uniform functions in even and odd characteristics. Here, we explicitly determine the second-order zero differential spectra of several maps with low differential uniformity. In particular, we compute the second-order zero differential spectra for some almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions over finite fields of odd characteristic, pushing further the study started in Boukerrou et al. and continued in Li et al.~[Cryptogr. Commun. 14.3 (2022), 653--662], and it turns out that our considered functions also have low second-order zero differential uniformity. Moreover, we study the second-order zero differential spectra of certain functions with low differential uniformity over finite fields of even characteristic. We connect this new concept to the sum-freedom and vanishing flats concepts and find some counts for the number of vanishing flats via our methods. We provide detailed analyses on several equations over finite fields that may have an interest outside of the scope of our paper.</description>

Abstract: Both maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that are not equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes (non-GRS MDS codes) and near MDS (NMDS) codes have nice applications in communication and storage systems. In this paper, we introduce and study a new family of linear codes involving their parameters, weight distributions, and self-orthogonal properties. We prove that such codes are either non-GRS MDS codes or NMDS codes, and hence, they can produce as many of the desired codes as possible. We also completely determine their weight distributions with the help of the solutions to some subset sum problems. A sufficient and necessary condition for such codes to be self-orthogonal is characterized. Based on this condition, we further deduce that there are no self-dual codes in this class of linear codes and explicitly construct two new classes of almost self-dual codes.</description>

      <title>A Superposition Code-Based Semantic Communication Approach with Quantifiable and Controllable Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure digital semantic communication (SemCom) approach based on superposition codes, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the eavesdropper' s reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping.</description>

Abstract: We give an operational definition of information-theoretic resources within a given multipartite classical or quantum correlation. We present our causal model that serves as the source coding side of this correlation and introduce a novel concept of resource rate. We argue that, beyond classical secrecy, additional resources exist that are useful for the security of distributed computing problems, which can be captured by the resource rate. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between resource rate and an extension of Shannon's logarithmic information measure, namely, total correlation.</description>

As particular cases, we present the complete algebraic description of the group algebra of any direct product of groups whose direct factors are cyclic, dihedral, or generalised quaternion groups. Finally, in the specific case of semisimple dihedral group algebras, we give a method to build quantum error-correcting codes, based on the CSS construction.</description>

      <title>SIC-free Multicast Scheduling for Multi-antenna Coded Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-antenna coded caching (CC) with multicast beamforming typically relies on a complex successive interference cancellation (SIC) structure to decode a superposition of multiple streams received by each user. Signal-level CC schemes require the regeneration and cancellation of interfering signals at the physical layer of each receiver, which complicates practical implementations. To address this, we propose a bit-level multicast scheduling scheme enabling linear, SIC-free decoding of parallel streams by repeatedly transmitting data terms with linearly independent coefficients. Two reference strategies and a novel sparse strategy are considered for constructing the coefficient matrix. The reference cases include the random strategy, which lacks control over matrix construction, and the equal-distant strategy, which balances users' interference and data terms equally. In contrast, the sparse strategy minimizes the number of multicast streams transmitted in parallel during each interval. This approach simplifies both the decoding process and the beamforming design by decoupling the desired data terms for each user and reducing the number of SINR constraints, respectively. To further enhance the symmetric rate, a successive projection algorithm is applied to exploit channel properties and optimize user ordering. With the coefficient matrix and optimized user ordering in place, multicast beamformers are devised to aggregate desired data from relevant multicast streams. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the sparse strategy and user scheduling, demonstrating significant gains in symmetric rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing optimal average-length binary codes under the constraint that each codeword must contain at most $D$ ones, where $D$ is a given input parameter. We provide an $O(n^2D)$-time complexity algorithm for the construction of such codes, where $n$ is the number of codewords. We also describe several scenarios where the need to design these kinds of codes naturally arises. Our algorithms allow us to construct both optimal average-length prefix binary codes and optimal average-length alphabetic binary codes. In the former case, our $O(n^2D)$-time algorithm substantially improves on the previously known $O(n^{2+D})$-time complexity algorithm for the same problem. We also provide a Kraft-like inequality for the existence of (optimal) variable-length binary codes, subject to the above-described constraint on the number of 1's in each codeword.</description>

      <title>A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.</description>

      <title>Improved Decoding of Tanner Codes</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present improved decoding algorithms for expander-based Tanner codes.
  We begin by developing a randomized linear-time decoding algorithm that, under the condition that $ \delta d_0 &gt; 2 $, corrects up to $ \alpha n $ errors for a Tanner code $ T(G, C_0) $, where $ G $ is a $ (c, d, \alpha, \delta) $-bipartite expander with $n$ left vertices, and $ C_0 \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^d $ is a linear inner code with minimum distance $ d_0 $. This result improves upon the previous work of Cheng, Ouyang, Shangguan, and Shen (RANDOM 2024), which required $ \delta d_0 &gt; 3 $.
  We further derandomize the algorithm to obtain a deterministic linear-time decoding algorithm with the same decoding radius. Our algorithm improves upon the previous deterministic algorithm of Cheng et al.\ by achieving a decoding radius of $ \alpha n $, compared with the previous radius of $ \frac{2\alpha}{d_0(1 + 0.5c\delta) }n$.
  Additionally, we investigate the size-expansion trade-off introduced by the recent work of Chen, Cheng, Li, and Ouyang (IEEE TIT 2023), and use it to provide new bounds on the minimum distance of Tanner codes. Specifically, we prove that the minimum distance of a Tanner code $T(G,C_0)$ is approximately $f_\delta^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{d_0} \right) \alpha n $, where $ f_\delta(\cdot) $ is the Size-Expansion Function. As another application, we improve the decoding radius of our decoding algorithms from $\alpha n$ to approximately $f_\delta^{-1}(\frac{2}{d_0})\alpha n$.</description>

      <title>Wrap-Decoding in Asynchronous Unsourced Multiple Access With and Without Delay Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An asynchronous $\ka$-active-user unsourced multiple access channel (AUMAC) is a key model for uncoordinated massive access in future networks. We focus on a scenario where each transmission is subject to the maximal delay constraint ($\dm$), and the precise delay of each user is unknown at the receiver. The combined effects of asynchronicity and uncertain delays require analysis over all possible delay-codeword combinations, making the complexity of the analysis grow with $\dm$ and $\ka$ exponentially. To overcome the complexity, we employ a wrap-decoder for the AUMAC and derive a uniform upper bound on the per-user probability of error (PUPE). The numerical result shows the trade-off between energy per bit and the number of active users under various delay constraints. Furthermore, in our considered AUMAC, decoding without explicit delay information is shown to achieve nearly the same energy efficiency as decoding with perfect delay knowledge.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Coded Caching for Partially Connected Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Oblivious Relaying and Variable-Length Noisy Lossy Source Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information bottleneck channel (or the oblivious relay channel) concerns a channel coding setting where the decoder does not directly observe the channel output. Rather, the channel output is relayed to the decoder by an oblivious relay (which does not know the codebook) via a rate-limited link. The capacity is known to be given by the information bottleneck. We study finite-blocklength achievability results of the channel, where the relay communicates to the decoder via fixed-length or variable-length codes. These two cases give rise to two different second-order versions of the information bottleneck. Our proofs utilize the nonasymptotic noisy lossy source coding results by Kostina and Verd\'{u}, the strong functional representation lemma, and the Poisson matching lemma. Moreover, we also give a novel nonasymptotic variable-length noisy lossy source coding result.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Distributed Source Simulation: As Quantum as it Can Get</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed source simulation is the task where two (or more) parties share some correlated randomness and use local operations and no communication to convert this into some target correlation. Wyner's seminal result showed that asymptotically the rate of uniform shared randomness needed for this task is given by a mutual information induced measure, now referred to as Wyner's common information. This asymptotic result was extended by Hayashi in the quantum setting to separable states, the largest class of states for which this task can be performed to vanishing error. In this work we characterize this task in a near-tight manner in the one-shot setting using the smooth entropy framework. We do this by introducing one-shot operational quantities and correlation measures that characterize them. We establish asymptotic equipartition properties for our correlation measures thereby recovering the previous vanishing-error asymptotic results. In doing so, we consider technical points in one-shot network information theory and provide methods for cardinality bounds in the smooth entropy calculus. We also introduce entangled state versions of the distributed source simulation task and determine bounds in this setting via quantum embezzling. This provides a strong characterization of this network task in the one-shot, quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning over Hierarchical Wireless Networks: Training Latency Minimization via Submodel Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) has demonstrated promising scalability advantages over the traditional "star-topology" architecture-based federated learning (FL). However, HFL still imposes significant computation, communication, and storage burdens on the edge, especially when training a large-scale model over resource-constrained wireless devices. In this paper, we propose hierarchical independent submodel training (HIST), a new FL methodology that aims to address these issues in hierarchical cloud-edge-client networks. The key idea behind HIST is to divide the global model into disjoint partitions (or submodels) per round so that each group of clients (i.e., cells) is responsible for training only one partition of the model. We characterize the convergence behavior of HIST under mild assumptions, showing the impacts of several key attributes (e.g., submodel sizes, number of cells, edge and global aggregation frequencies) on the rate and stationarity gap. Building upon the theoretical results, we propose a submodel partitioning strategy to minimize the training latency depending on network resource availability and a target learning performance guarantee. We then demonstrate how HIST can be augmented with over-the-air computation (AirComp) to further enhance the efficiency of the model aggregation over the edge cells. Through numerical evaluations, we verify that HIST is able to save training time and communication costs by wide margins while achieving comparable accuracy as conventional HFL. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate that AirComp-assisted HIST provides further improvements in training latency.</description>

      <title>The differential properties of certain permutation polynomials over finite fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding functions, particularly permutations, with good differential properties has received a lot of attention due to their varied applications. For instance, in combinatorial design theory, a correspondence of perfect $c$-nonlinear functions and difference sets in some quasigroups was recently shown by Anbar et al. (J. Comb. Des. 31(12):1-24, 2023). Additionally, in a recent manuscript by Pal et al. (Adv. Math. Communications, to appear), a very interesting connection between the $c$-differential uniformity and boomerang uniformity, when $c=-1$, was pointed out, showing that they are the same for an odd APN permutation, sparking yet more interest in the construction of functions with low $c$-differential uniformity. We investigate the $c$-differential uniformity of some classes of permutation polynomials. As a result, we add four more classes of permutation polynomials to the family of functions that only contains a few (non-trivial) perfect $c$-nonlinear functions over finite fields of even characteristic. Moreover, we include a class of permutation polynomials with low $c$-differential uniformity over the field of characteristic~$3$. To solve the involved equations over finite fields, we use various number theoretical techniques, in particular, we find explicitly many Walsh transform coefficients and Weil sums that may be of an independent interest.</description>

      <title>Jammer-Resilient Time Synchronization in the MIMO Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a promising approach to jammer mitigation. Effective MIMO data detectors that mitigate smart jammers have recently been proposed, but they all assume perfect time synchronization between transmitter(s) and receiver. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no methods for resilient time synchronization in the presence of smart jammers. To remedy this situation, we propose JASS, the first method that enables reliable time synchronization for the single-user MIMO uplink while mitigating smart jamming attacks. JASS detects a randomized synchronization sequence based on a novel optimization problem that fits a spatial filter to the time-windowed receive signal in order to mitigate the jammer. We underscore the efficacy of the proposed optimization problem by proving that it ensures successful time synchronization under certain intuitive conditions. We then derive an efficient algorithm for approximately solving our optimization problem. Finally, we use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of JASS against a wide range of different jammer types.</description>

      <title>Sphere packing proper colorings of an expander graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce graphical error-correcting codes, a new notion of error-correcting codes on $[q]^n$, where a code is a set of proper $q$-colorings of some fixed $n$-vertex graph $G$. We then say that a set of $M$ proper $q$-colorings of $G$ form a $(G, M, d)$ code if any pair of colorings in the set have Hamming distance at least $d$. This directly generalizes typical $(n, M, d)$ codes of $q$-ary strings of length $n$ since we can take $G$ as the empty graph on $n$ vertices.
  We investigate how one-sided spectral expansion relates to the largest possible set of error-correcting colorings on a graph. For fixed $(\delta, \lambda) \in [0, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ and positive integer $d$, let $f_{\delta, \lambda, d}(n)$ denote the maximum $M$ such that there exists some $d$-regular graph $G$ on at most $n$ vertices with normalized second eigenvalue at most $\lambda$ that has a $(G, M, d)$ code. We study the growth of $f$ as $n$ goes to infinity. We partially characterize the regimes of $(\delta, \lambda)$ where $f$ grows exponentially or is bounded by a constant, respectively. We also prove several sharp phase transitions between these regimes.</description>

      <title>DiffCom: Channel Received Signal is a Natural Condition to Guide Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end visual communication systems typically optimize a trade-off between channel bandwidth costs and signal-level distortion metrics. However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) is a promising technology to secure wireless communications by exploiting the physical properties of the wireless channel. However, the passive nature of PLS creates a significant imbalance between the effort required by eavesdroppers and legitimate users to secure data. To address this imbalance, in this article, we propose a novel framework of physical layer deception (PLD), which combines PLS with deception technologies to actively counteract wiretapping attempts. Combining a two-stage encoder with randomized ciphering and non-orthogonal multiplexing, the PLD approach enables the wireless communication system to proactively counter eavesdroppers with deceptive messages. Relying solely on the superiority of the legitimate channel over the eavesdropping channel, the PLD framework can effectively protect the confidentiality of the transmitted messages, even against eavesdroppers who possess knowledge equivalent to that of the legitimate receiver. We prove the validity of the PLD framework with in-depth analyses and demonstrate its superiority over conventional PLS approaches with comprehensive numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The revised boomerang connectivity tables and their connection to the Difference Distribution Table</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that functions over finite fields play a crucial role in designing substitution boxes (S-boxes) in modern block ciphers. In order to analyze the security of an S-box, recently, three new tables have been introduced: the Extended Boomerang Connectivity Table (EBCT), the Lower Boomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT), and the Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table (UBCT). In fact, these tables offer improved methods over the usual Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT) for analyzing the security of S-boxes against boomerang-style attacks. Here, we put in context these new EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT concepts by connecting them to the DDT for a differentially $\delta$-uniform function and also determine the EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT entries of three classes of differentially $4$-uniform power permutations, namely, Gold, Kasami and Bracken-Leander. We also determine the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table (DBCT) entries of the Gold function. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain some previously published results quite easily.</description>

Abstract: Non-orthogonal quantum states pose a fundamental challenge in quantum information processing, as they cannot be distinguished with absolute certainty. Conventionally, the focus has been on minimizing error probability in quantum state discrimination tasks. However, another criterion known as quantum guesswork has emerged as a crucial measure in assessing the distinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states, when we are allowed to query a sequence of states. In this paper, we generalize well known properties in the classical setting that are relevant for the guessing problem. Specifically, we establish the pre and post Data Processing Inequalities. We also derive a more refined lower bound on quantum guesswork.</description>

      <title>OciorABA: Improved Error-Free Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement via Partial Vector Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an error-free, information-theoretically secure multi-valued asynchronous Byzantine agreement (ABA) protocol, called OciorABA. This protocol achieves ABA consensus on an $\ell$-bit message with an expected communication complexity of $O(n\ell + n^3 \log q )$ bits and an expected round complexity of $O(1)$ rounds, under the optimal resilience condition $n \geq 3t + 1$ in an $n$-node network, where up to $t$ nodes may be dishonest. Here, $q$ denotes the alphabet size of the error correction code used in the protocol. In our protocol design, we introduce a new primitive: asynchronous partial vector agreement (APVA). In APVA, the distributed nodes input their vectors and aim to output a common vector, where some of the elements of those vectors may be missing or unknown. We propose an APVA protocol with an expected communication complexity of $O( n^3 \log q )$ bits and an expected round complexity of $O(1)$ rounds. This APVA protocol serves as a key building block for our OciorABA protocol.</description>
