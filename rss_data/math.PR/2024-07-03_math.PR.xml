      <title>Asymptotic behaviors of subcritical branching killed Brownian motion with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01816v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviors of a subcritical branching killed Brownian motion with drift $-\rho$ and offspring distribution $\{p_k:k\ge 0\}$. Let $\widetilde{\zeta}^{-\rho}$ be the extinction time of this subcritical branching killed Brownian motion, $\widetilde{M}_t^{-\rho}$ the maximal position of all the particles alive at time $t$ and $\widetilde{M}^{-\rho}:=\max_{t\ge 0}\widetilde{M}_t^{-\rho}$ the all time maximal position. Let $\mathbb{P}_x$ be the law of this subcritical branching killed Brownian motion when the initial particle is located at $x\in (0,\infty)$. Under the assumption $\sum_{k=1}^\infty k (\log k) p_k &lt;\infty$, we establish the decay rates of $\mathbb{P}_x(\widetilde{\zeta}^{-\rho}&gt;t)$ and $\mathbb{P}_x(\widetilde{M}^{-\rho}&gt;y)$ as $t$ and $y$ tend to $\infty$ respectively. We also establish the decay rate of $\mathbb{P}_x(\widetilde{M}_t^{-\rho}&gt;z(t,\rho))$ as $t\to\infty$, where $z(t,\rho)=\sqrt{t}z-\rho t$ for $\rho\leq 0$ and $z(t,\rho)=z$ for $\rho&gt;0$. As a consequence, we obtain a Yaglom-type limit theorem.</description>

      <title>An infinite server system with packing constraints and ranked servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A service system with multiple types of customers, arriving as Poisson processes, is considered. The system has infinite number of servers, ranked by $1,2,3, \ldots$; a server rank is its ``location." Each customer has an independent exponentially distributed service time, with the mean determined by its type. Multiple customers (possibly of different types) can be placed for service into one server, subject to ``packing'' constraints. Service times of different customers are independent, even if served simultaneously by the same server. The large-scale asymptotic regime is considered, such that the mean number of customers $r$ goes to infinity.
  We seek algorithms with the underlying objective of minimizing the location (rank) $U$ of the right-most (highest ranked) occupied (non-empty) server. Therefore, this objective seeks to minimize the total number $Q$ of occupied servers {\em and} keep the set of occupied servers as far at the ``left'' as possible, i.e., keep $U$ close to $Q$. In previous work, versions of {\em Greedy Random} (GRAND) algorithm have been shown to asymptotically minimize $Q/r$ as $r\to\infty$. In this paper we show that when these algorithms are combined with the First-Fit rule for ``taking'' empty servers, they asymptotically minimize $U/r$ as well.</description>

      <title>The Accumulation of Beneficial Mutations and Convergence to a Poisson Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model of a population with fixed size $N$, which is subjected to an unlimited supply of beneficial mutations at a constant rate $\mu_N$. Individuals with $k$ beneficial mutations have the fitness $(1+s_N)^k$. Each individual dies at rate 1 and is replaced by a random individual chosen with probability proportional to its fitness. We show that when $\mu_N \ll 1/(N \log N)$ and $N^{-\eta} \ll s_N \ll 1$ for some $\eta &lt; 1$, large numbers of beneficial mutations are present in the population at the same time, competing against each other, yet the fixation times of beneficial mutations, after a time scaling, converge to the times of a Poisson process.</description>

      <title>Condensation in Fleming--Viot particle systems with fast selection mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Fleming--Viot particle system in a discrete state space, in the regime of a fast selection mechanism, namely with killing rates which grow to infinity. This asymptotics creates a time scale separation which results in the formation of a condensate of all particles, which then evolves according to a continuous-time Markov chain with jump rates depending in a nontrivial way on both the underlying mutation dynamics and the relative speed of growth to infinity of the killing rate between neighbouring sites. We prove the convergence of the particle system and completely describe the dynamics of the condensate in the case where the number of particles is kept fixed, and partially in the case when the number of particles goes to infinity together with (but slower than) the minimal killing rate.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the $\phi^4_1$ measure in the sharp interface limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $\phi^4_1$ measure in an interval of length $\ell$, defined by a symmetric double-well potential $W$ and inverse temperature $\beta$. Our results concern its asymptotic behavior in the joint limit $\beta, \ell \to \infty$, both in the subcritical regime $\ell \ll \rme^{\beta C_W}$ and in the supercritical regime $\ell \gg \rme^{\beta C_W}$, where $C_W$ denotes the surface tension. In the former case, in which the measure concentrates on the pure phases, we prove the corresponding large deviation principle. The associated rate function is the Modica-Mortola functional modified to take into account the entropy of the locations of the interfaces. Further, we provide the sharp asymptotics of the probability of having a given number of transitions between the two pure phases. In the supercritical regime, the measure does not longer concentrate and we show that the interfaces are asymptotically distributed according to a Poisson point process.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Fractional PDEs from interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes, we describe the strategy for the derivation of the hydrodynamic limit for a family of long range interacting particle systems of exclusion type with symmetric rates. For $m \in \mathbb{N}:=\{1, 2, \ldots\}$ fixed, the hydrodynamic equation is $\partial_t \rho(t,u)= [-(-\Delta)^{\gamma /2} \rho^m](t,u) $. For $m=1$, this {is} the fractional equation, which is linear. On the other hand, for $m \geq 2$, this is the fractional porous medium equation (which is nonlinear), obtained by choosing a rate which depends on the number of particles next to the initial and final position of a jump.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion of a Hurst index estimator for a stochastic differential equation driven by fBm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of an estimator of Hurst parameter of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion with $H &gt; 1/2$. Utilizing the theory of asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals introduced by Nualart and Yoshida [NY19], we derive an asymptotic expansion formula of the distribution of the estimator. As an corollary, we also obtain a mixed central limit theorem for the statistic, indicating that the rate of convergence is $n^{-\frac12}$, which improves the results in the previous literature. To handle second-order quadratic variations appearing in the estimator, a theory of exponent has been developed based on weighted graphs to estimate asymptotic orders of norms of functionals involved.</description>

      <title>General limit theorems for mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mixtures of free, monotone, and boolean independence described by directed graphs (digraphs). For a sequence of digraphs $G_n = (V_n,E_n)$, we give sufficient conditions for the limit $\widehat{\mu} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \boxplus_{G_n}(\mu_n)$ to exist whenever the boolean convolution powers $\mu_n^{\uplus |V_n|}$ converge to some $\mu$. This in particular includes central limit and Poisson limit theorems, as well as limit theorems for each classical domain of attraction. The hypothesis on the sequence of $G_n$ is that the normalized counts of digraph homomorphisms from rooted trees into $G_n$ converge as $n \to \infty$, and we verify this for several families of examples where the $G_n$'s converge in some sense to a continuum limit. In particular, we obtain a new limit theorems for multiregular digraphs, as well as recovering several limit theorems in prior work.</description>

      <title>Some properties of a non-hydrostatic stochastic oceanic primitive equations model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how relaxing the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis affects theoretical aspects of the LU primitive equations well-posedness. We focus on models that sit between incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and standard LU primitive equations, aiming for numerical manageability while capturing non-hydrostatic phenomena. Our main result concerns the well-posedness of a specific stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations. This holds with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, and when the horizontal component of noise is independent of z. In fact these conditions can be related to the dynamical regime in which the primitive equations remain valid. Moreover, under these conditions, we show that the LU primitive equations solution tends toward the one of the deterministic primitive equations for a vanishing noise, thus providing a physical coherence to the LU stochastic model.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Calculus Approach to Boltzmann Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Monte Carlo methods for particle transport utilize source iteration to express the solution, the flux density, of the transport equation as a Neumann series. Our contribution is to show that the particle paths simulated within source iteration are associated with the adjoint flux density and the adjoint particle paths are associated with the flux density. We make our assertion rigorous through the use of stochastic calculus by representing the particle path used in source iteration as a solution to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The solution to the adjoint Boltzmann equation is then expressed in terms of the same SDE and the solution to the Boltzmann equation is expressed in terms of the SDE associated with the adjoint particle process. An important consequence is that the particle paths used within source iteration simultaneously provide Monte Carlo approximations of the flux density and adjoint flux density. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to support the simultaneous use of the particle paths.</description>

      <title>Derivation of stochastic models for coastal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stochastic nonlinear formulation of classical coastal waves models under location uncertainty (LU). In the formal setting investigated here, stochastic versions of the Serre-Green- Nagdi, Boussinesq and classical shallow water wave models are obtained through an asymptotic expansion, which is similar to the one operated in the deterministic setting. However, modified advection terms emerge, together with advection noise terms. These terms are well-known features arising from the LU formalism, based on momentum conservation principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a transport map from Poisson point processes onto ultra-log-concave measures over the natural numbers, and show that this map is a contraction. Our approach overcomes the known obstacles to transferring functional inequalities using transport maps in discrete settings, and allows us to deduce a number of functional inequalities for ultra-log-concave measures. In particular, we provide the currently best known constant in modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities for ultra-log-concave measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mapping behavior of the Marchaud fractional derivative with different extensions in the scale of fractional weighted Sobolev spaces. In particular we show that the $\alpha$--order Riemann--Liouville fractional derivative maps $W^{p,s}_0(\Omega)$ to $W^{p,s-\alpha}(\Omega)$, for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;s&lt;1$ and the $\alpha$--order Marchaud fractional derivative with even extension maps the fractional Sobolev space $W^{p,s}((0,\infty))$ to $W^{p,s-\alpha}(\real)$ for all $0&lt;\alpha&lt;s&lt;1$ and $ps\geq1$ . The proof is based on the Calder\'{o}n--Lions interpolation theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new method for creating prediction sets that combines the flexibility of conformal methods with an estimate of the conditional distribution $P_{Y \mid X}$. Most existing methods, such as conformalized quantile regression and probabilistic conformal prediction, only offer marginal coverage guarantees. Our approach extends these methods to achieve conditional coverage, which is essential for many practical applications. While exact conditional guarantees are impossible without assumptions on the data distribution, we provide non-asymptotic bounds that explicitly depend on the quality of the available estimate of the conditional distribution. Our confidence sets are highly adaptive to the local structure of the data, making them particularly useful in high heteroskedasticity situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage and improves the reliability of statistical inference in a wide range of applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a continuous-time model of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for the least-square problem. Indeed, pursuing the work of Li et al. (2019), we analyze Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) that model SGD either in the case of the training loss (finite samples) or the population one (online setting). A key qualitative feature of the dynamics is the existence of a perfect interpolator of the data, irrespective of the sample size. In both scenarios, we provide precise, non-asymptotic rates of convergence to the (possibly degenerate) stationary distribution. Additionally, we describe this asymptotic distribution, offering estimates of its mean, deviations from it, and a proof of the emergence of heavy-tails related to the step-size magnitude. Numerical simulations supporting our findings are also presented.</description>

      <title>The Symplectic Schur Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a measure on tuples of partitions, called the symplectic Schur process, that should be regarded as the right analogue of the Schur process of Okounkov-Reshetikhin for the Cartan type C. The weights of our measure include factors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of "Down-Up Schur functions" that we define and for which we prove new identities of Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process corresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an explicit correlation kernel. We also present dynamics that preserve the family of symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based on the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the asymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the limit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit regimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.</description>

      <title>Group measure space construction, ergodicity and $W^\ast$-rigidity for stable random fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.14821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work discovers a novel link between probability theory (of stable random fields) and von Neumann algebras. It is established that the group measure space construction corresponding to a minimal representation is an invariant of a stationary symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) random field indexed by any countable group $G$. When $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$, we characterize ergodicity (and also absolute non-ergodicity) of stationary S$\alpha$S fields in terms of the central decomposition of this crossed product von Neumann algebra coming from any (not necessarily minimal) Rosinski representation. This shows that ergodicity (or the complete absence of it) is a $W^\ast$-rigid property (in a suitable sense) for this class of fields. All our results have analogues for stationary max-stable random fields as well.</description>

      <title>Path independence for the additive functionals of stochastic Volterra equations with singular kernels and H\"older continuous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with stochastic Volterra equations with singular kernels and H\"older continuous coefficients. We first establish the well-posedness of these equations by utilising the Yamada-Watanabe approach. Then, we aim to characterise the path-independence for additive functionals of these equations. The main challenge here is that the solutions of stochastic Volterra equations are not semimartingales nor Markov processes, thus the existing techniques for obtaining the path-independence of usual, semimartingale type stochastic differential equations are no longer applicable. To overcome this difficulty, we link the concerned stochastic Volterra equations to mild formulation of certain parabolic type stochastic partial differential equations, and further apply our previous results on the path-independence for stochastic evolution equations to get the desired result. Finally, as an important application, we consider a class of stochastic Volterra equations whose kernels are related with fractional Brownian motions and derive the path-independence of additive functionals for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given finite i.i.d.~samples in a Hilbert space with zero mean and trace-class covariance operator $\Sigma$, the problem of recovering the spectral projectors of $\Sigma$ naturally arises in many applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of finding distributional approximations of the spectral projectors of the empirical covariance operator $\hat \Sigma$, and offer a dimension-free framework where the complexity is characterized by the so-called relative rank of $\Sigma$. In this setting, novel quantitative limit theorems and bootstrap approximations are presented subject only to mild conditions in terms of moments and spectral decay. In many cases, these even improve upon existing results in a Gaussian setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that martingale transport plans between marginals $\mu\neq\nu$ are never given by Monge maps -- with the understanding that the map is over the first marginal $\mu$, or forward in time. Here, we change the perspective, with surprising results. We show that any distributions $\mu,\nu$ in convex order with $\nu$ atomless admit a martingale coupling given by a Monge map over the second marginal $\nu$. Namely, we construct a particular coupling called the barcode transport. Much more generally, we prove that such ``backward Monge'' martingale transports are dense in the set of all martingale couplings, paralleling the classical denseness result for Monge transports in the Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport. Various properties and applications are presented, including a refined version of Strassen's theorem and a mimicking theorem where the marginals of a given martingale are reproduced by a ``backward deterministic'' martingale, a remarkable type of process whose current state encodes its whole history.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotics of extremal lp-blocks cluster inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremes occur in stationary regularly varying time series as short periods with several large observations, known as extremal blocks. We study cluster statistics summarizing the behavior of functions acting on these extremal blocks. Examples of cluster statistics are the extremal index, cluster size probabilities, and other cluster indices. The purpose of our work is twofold. First, we state the asymptotic normality of block estimators for cluster inference based on consecutive observations with large $\ell^p$-norms, for $p&gt; 0$.  The case $p=\alpha$, where $\alpha&gt; 0$ is the tail index of the time series, has specific nice properties thus we analyze the asymptotic of blocks estimators when approximating $\alpha$ using the Hill estimator. Second, we verify the conditions we require on classical models such as linear models and solutions of  stochastic recurrence equations. Regarding linear models, we prove that the asymptotic variance of classical index cluster-based estimators is null as first conjectured in Hsing T. [26]. We illustrate our findings on simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a generalized scale function of standard processes, we characterize it as a unique solution to a Volterra type integral equation. This allows us to extend it to an entire function and to derive a useful identity that we call the resolvent identity. We apply this result to study the existence of a quasi-stationary distribution for the processes killed at hitting boundaries. A new classification of the boundary, which is a natural extension of Feller's for one-dimensional diffusions, is introduced and plays a central role to characterize the existence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1711.03642v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the technique of enlargement of filtrations, we demonstrate how to incorporate information about the future trend of the stochastic interest rate process into a financial model. By modeling the interest rate as an affine diffusion process, we obtain explicit formulas for the additional expected logarithmic utility in solving the optimal portfolio problem. We begin by solving the problem when the additional information directly refers to the interest rate process, and then extend the analysis to the case where the information relates to the values of an underlying Markov chain. The dynamics of this chain may depend on anticipated market information, jump at predefined epochs, and modulate the parameters of the stochastic interest rate process. The theoretical study is then complemented by an illustrative numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Strategy Complexity of Reachability in Countable Stochastic 2-Player Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study countably infinite stochastic 2-player games with reachability objectives. Our results provide a complete picture of the memory requirements of $\varepsilon$-optimal (resp. optimal) strategies. These results depend on the size of the players' action sets and on whether one requires strategies that are uniform (i.e., independent of the start state).
  Our main result is that $\varepsilon$-optimal (resp. optimal) Maximizer strategies require infinite memory if Minimizer is allowed infinite action sets. This lower bound holds even under very strong restrictions. Even in the special case of infinitely branching turn-based reachability games, even if all states allow an almost surely winning Maximizer strategy, strategies with a step counter plus finite private memory are still useless.
  Regarding uniformity, we show that for Maximizer there need not exist positional (i.e., memoryless) uniformly $\varepsilon$-optimal strategies even in the special case of finite action sets or in finitely branching turn-based games. On the other hand, in games with finite action sets, there always exists a uniformly $\varepsilon$-optimal Maximizer strategy that uses just one bit of public memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guyon and Lekeufack recently proposed a path-dependent volatility model and documented its excellent performance in fitting market data and capturing stylized facts. The instantaneous volatility is modeled as a linear combination of two processes, one is an integral of weighted past price returns and the other is the square-root of an integral of weighted past squared volatility. Each of the weightings is built using two exponential kernels reflecting long and short memory. Mathematically, the model is a coupled system of four stochastic differential equations. Our main result is the wellposedness of this system: the model has a unique strong (non-explosive) solution for all parameter values. We also study the positivity of the resulting volatility process and the martingale property of the associated exponential price process.</description>

      <title>Doeblin Coefficients and Related Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doeblin coefficients are a classical tool for analyzing the ergodicity and exponential convergence rates of Markov chains. Propelled by recent works on contraction coefficients of strong data processing inequalities, we investigate whether Doeblin coefficients also exhibit some of the notable properties of canonical contraction coefficients. In this paper, we present several new structural and geometric properties of Doeblin coefficients. Specifically, we show that Doeblin coefficients form a multi-way divergence, exhibit tensorization, and possess an extremal trace characterization. We then show that they also have extremal coupling and simultaneously maximal coupling characterizations. By leveraging these characterizations, we demonstrate that Doeblin coefficients act as a nice generalization of the well-known total variation (TV) distance to a multi-way divergence, enabling us to measure the "distance" between multiple distributions rather than just two. We then prove that Doeblin coefficients exhibit contraction properties over Bayesian networks similar to other canonical contraction coefficients. We additionally derive some other results and discuss an application of Doeblin coefficients to distribution fusion. Finally, in a complementary vein, we introduce and discuss three new quantities: max-Doeblin coefficient, max-DeGroot distance, and min-DeGroot distance. The max-Doeblin coefficient shares a connection with the concept of maximal leakage in information security; we explore its properties and provide a coupling characterization. On the other hand, the max-DeGroot and min-DeGroot measures extend the concept of DeGroot distance to multiple distributions.</description>

      <title>Insider trading in discrete time Kyle games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new discrete time version of Kyle's (1985) classic model of insider trading, formulated as a generalised extensive form game. The model has three kinds of traders: an insider, random noise traders, and a market maker. The insider aims to exploit her informational advantage and maximise expected profits while the market maker observes the total order flow and sets prices accordingly.
  First, we show how the multi-period model with finitely many pure strategies can be reduced to a (static) social system in the sense of Debreu (1952) and prove the existence of a sequential Kyle equilibrium, following Kreps and Wilson (1982). This works for any probability distribution with finite support of the noise trader's demand and the true value, and for any finite information flow of the insider. In contrast to Kyle (1985) with normal distributions, equilibria exist in general only in mixed strategies and not in pure strategies.
  In the single-period model we establish bounds for the insider's strategy in equilibrium. Finally, we prove the existence of an equilibrium for the game with a continuum of actions, by considering an approximating sequence of games with finitely many actions. Because of the lack of compactness of the set of measurable price functions, standard infinite-dimensional fixed point theorems are not applicable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics `scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generation of Random (Generalized) Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.</description>
