      <title>Higher Dimensional Birkhoff attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend to higher dimensions the notion of Birkhoff attractor of a dissipative map. We prove that this notion coincides with the classical Birkhoff attractor. We prove that for the dissipative system associated to the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation the graph of a solution is contained in the Birkhoff attractor. We also study what happens when we perturb a Hamiltonian system to make it dissipative and let the perturbation go to zero. The paper contains two important results on $\gamma$-supports and elements of the $\gamma$-completion of the space of exact Lagrangians. Firstly the $\gamma$-support of a Lagrangian in a cotangent bundle carries the cohomology of the base and secondly given an exact Lagrangian $L$, any Floer theoretic equivalent Lagrangian is the $\gamma$-limit of Hamiltonian images of $L$.</description>

      <title>Hofer Energy and Link Preserving Diffeomorphisms in Higher Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a pre-monotone Lagrangian link, we obtain Hofer energy estimates for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms preserving it. Such estimates depend on the braid type of the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism only, and the natural language to talk about this phenomenon is provided by a family of norms on braid groups for surfaces with boundary. This generalises the results obtained by the first author to higher genus surfaces with boundary.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Geometry for Engineers, Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical theory underlying Hamiltonian mechanics is called symplectic geometry. So symplectic geometry arose from the roots of mechanics and is seen as one of the most valuable links between physics and mathematics today. Symplectic geometry in its simplest possible case is the geometry of the plane. Surprise is, we can hardly find relevant publications regarding that simple 2D case. Primary goal of this paper is to discuss the suitability of symplectic geometry in the plane for solving standard geometric and mechanical problems in physics and engineering education.</description>

      <title>On aspherical symplectic fillings with finite capacities of the prequantization bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prequantization bundle is a negative circle bundle over a symplectic surface together with a contact form induced by a S1-invariant connection. Given a symplectically aspherical symplectic filling of a prequantization bundle satisfying certain topological conditions, suppose that a version of symplectic capacity of the symplectic filling is finite. Then, we show that the symplectic filling is diffeomorphic to the associated disk bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study contact structures on smooth complex projective varieties with a simple normal crossing divisor, generalizing some well-known results concerning the non-logarithmic case. In particular, we describe the structure of elementary log contractions of such log varieties and we construct the corresponding contact structures.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Heegaard Floer cohomology and the Calabi invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new family of spectral invariants associated to certain Lagrangian links in compact and connected surfaces of any genus. We show that our invariants recover the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonians in their limit. As applications, we resolve several open questions from topological surface dynamics and continuous symplectic topology: we show that the group of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms of any compact surface with (possibly empty) boundary is not simple; we extend the Calabi homomorphism to the group of Hameomorphisms constructed by Oh-M\"uller; and, we construct an infinite dimensional family of quasimorphisms on the group of area and orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the two-sphere. Our invariants are inspired by recent work of Polterovich and Shelukhin defining and applying spectral invariants for certain classes of links in the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>The Arnold conjecture for singular symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01344v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Hamiltonian dynamics on singular symplectic manifolds and prove the Arnold conjecture for a large class of $b^m$-symplectic manifolds. Novel techniques are introduced to associate smooth symplectic forms to the original singular symplectic structure, under some mild conditions. These techniques yield the validity of the Arnold conjecture for singular symplectic manifolds across multiple scenarios. More precisely, we prove a lower bound on the number 1-periodic Hamiltonian orbits for $b^{2m}$-symplectic manifolds depending only on the topology of the manifold. Moreover, for $b^m$-symplectic surfaces, we improve the lower bound depending on the topology of the pair $(M,Z)$. We then venture into the study of Floer homology to this singular realm and we conclude with a list of open questions.</description>

      <title>Floer theory for the variation operator of an isolated singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variation operator in singularity theory maps relative homology cycles to compact cycles in the Milnor fiber using the monodromy. We construct its symplectic analogue for an isolated singularity. We define a new Floer cohomology, called monodromy Lagrangian Floer cohomology, which provides categorifications of the standard theorems on the variation operator and the Seifert form. The key ingredients are a special class $\Gamma$ in the symplectic cohomology of the inverse of the monodromy and its closed-open images. For isolated plane curve singularities whose A'Campo divide has depth zero, we find an exceptional collection consisting of non-compact Lagrangians in the Milnor fiber corresponding to a distinguished collection of vanishing cycles under the variation operator.</description>

      <title>Compatible $E$-Differential Forms on Lie Algebroids over (Pre-)Multisymplectic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08193v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider higher generalizations of both a (twisted) Poisson structure and the equivariant condition of a momentum map on a symplectic manifold. On a Lie algebroid over a (pre-)symplectic and (pre-)multisymplectic manifold, we introduce a Lie algebroid differential form called a compatible $E$-$n$-form. This differential form satisfies a compatibility condition, which is consistent with both the Lie algebroid structure and the (pre-)(multi)symplectic structure. There are many interesting examples such as a Poisson structure, a twisted Poisson structure and a twisted $R$-Poisson structure for a pre-$n$-plectic manifold. Moreover, momentum maps and momentum sections on symplectic manifolds, homotopy momentum maps and homotopy momentum sections on multisymplectic manifolds have this structure.</description>

      <title>Counting curves with tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting tangency as a limit of two transverse intersections, we obtain a concrete formula to enumerate smooth degree d plane curves tangent to a given line at multiple points with arbitrary order of tangency. One nodal curves with multiple tangencies of any order are enumerated. Also, one cuspidal curves, that are tangent to first order to a given line at multiple points, are enumerated.
  We also present a new way to enumerate curves with one node; it is interpreted as a degeneration of a curve tangent to a given line. That method is extended to enumerate curves with two nodes, and also curves with one tacnode are enumerated. In the final part of the paper, it is shown how this idea can be applied in the setting of stable maps and perform a concrete computation to enumerate rational curves with first order tangency. A large number of low degree cases have been worked out explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every irreducible component of the coarse Koll\'ar-Shepherd-Barron and Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of stable log Calabi-Yau surfaces is a finite quotient of a projective toric variety. This verifies a conjecture of Hacking-Keel-Yu. The proof combines tools from log smooth deformation theory, the minimal model program, punctured log Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry.</description>
