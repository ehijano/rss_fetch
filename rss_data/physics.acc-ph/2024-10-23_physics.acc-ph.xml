      <title>The design of high-brightness ERL-FEL injector based on VHF electron gun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, the fourth-generation light source based on the combination of Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) and Free-Electron Laser (FEL) using superconducting linear accelerators has garnered significant attention. It holds immense potential, particularly in generating high-power Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light sources. This article primarily focuses on the physical design of an injector for ERL-FEL, based on a Very High Frequency (VHF) electron gun with a charge of 100 pC. The beam energy is accelerated to 10 MeV using 3-cell superconducting cavity. The optimization of beam parameters is conducted through employment of BMad and ASTRA simulations, incorporating the concept of Merger optimization. The beam emittance is less than 0.6 mm mrad, and the peak current at the injector exit exceeds 18 A. We present a new method to evaluate the Longitudinal Space Charge (LSC) effects in merger sections, which can be readily applied in design work. Furthermore, we introduce a novel type of merger. The performance of this new merger is comparable to the previously known optimum, the zigzag merger, offering a potential alternative solution for injectors in ERLs.</description>

      <title>Spectrally shaped THz pulses from tapered dielectric waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to exploit the complete scientific potential of user-oriented accelerator facilities, it is necessary to provide adequate pump sources to enable pump-probe science. The users of the European XFEL have requested a THz pump source matching the X-ray repetition rate (10 Hz burst mode with up to 2700 bunches per burst) with a wide range of properties. The quest for suitable THz sources is thus a major development goal. The EuXFEL R\&amp;D project STERN is exploring beam-based radiation generation methods using Cherenkov waveguides to satisfy these user requirements. In this work, custom waveguide geometries are designed to generate a THz pulse with arbitrary spectral content. The layer-thickness or inner radius of a wakefield structure is tapered to generate flattop or Gaussian pulses up to $1 \ \mathrm{THz}$, which can be scaled to higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the maximal proper acceleration in the inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of a hypothetical maximal proper acceleration on the mass of a charged particles is investigated in the context of particle accelerators. In particular, it is shown that maximal proper acceleration implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the particle being accelerated with respect to the relativistic energy. Such an increase in kinetic energy leads to a reduction of the luminosity of the bunches with respect to the expected luminosity in the relativistic models of the bunches. This relative loss in luminosity is of the order $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$ for the LHC bunches and can be of order up to $10^{-3}$ for certain laser plasma accelerator facilities. Although the effect is small, it increases with the square of the bunch population.</description>

      <title>Analytic model of stable shock-like structures in laser interaction with underdense plasma for identifying of phase and polarization dependent regime of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing a stable shock-like structure that is formed when an ultra-intense laser propagates through an underdense plasma. It is shown that such structures exist in a wide range of laser-plasma parameters, with a unique sub-luminal shock front velocity for each parameter. Numerical methods to accurately describe such shock-front is developed. The formalism is applied to describe the parameter space in which the Carrier-Envelope-Phase (CEP) effect under which phase and polarization dependent super-ponderomotive effects becomes significant. The developed formalism will enable quick identification of regimes in which CEP effects become significant, expediting designing of Laser Wakefield Accelerators operating in the superponderomotive regime.</description>
