      <title>Gosling Designer: a Platform to Democratize Construction and Sharing of Genomics Data Visualization Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of genomics data is central to nearly all areas of modern biology. Despite significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational methods, these technologies require significant human oversight to generate novel and reliable biological insights. Consequently, the genomics community has developed a substantial number of diverse visualization approaches and a proliferation of tools that biologists rely on in their data analysis workflows. While there are a few commonly used visualization tools for genomics data, many tools target specific use cases for genomics data interpretation and offer only a limited, predefined set of visualization types. Moreover, static visualizations often fail to support exploratory analysis. Developing interactive visualizations and tools typically requires significant time and technical expertise, even when supported by modern LLM-powered coding assistants, and the resulting visualizations can be difficult to share among collaborators. We developed Gosling Designer, an all-in-one platform for editing, exploring, and sharing visualizations of genomics data. Gosling Designer addresses four key challenges observed in existing genomics visualization tools: (1) limited versatility, (2) difficulty of visualization authoring, (3) complexity of data management, and (4) barriers to sharing and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Life-Code: Central Dogma Modeling with Multi-Omics Sequence Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.</description>
