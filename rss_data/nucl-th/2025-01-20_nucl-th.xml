      <title>$\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ potentials in neutron stars, hypernuclei, and heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an appropriate $YNN$ force, the $\Lambda$ single-particle potential ($\Lambda$ potential) can be made strongly repulsive at high density, and one can solve the hyperon puzzle of neutron stars. We investigate the consistency of such a $\Lambda$ potential, evaluated recently from $YN$ and $YNN$ forces based on chiral effective field theory, with hypernuclear data and heavy-ion collision data. It is found that model calculations with such a $\Lambda$ potential can reproduce the data of the $\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy and the $\Lambda$ directed flow in heavy-ion collisions. Also, we evaluate the $\Sigma$ potential, which can be calculated by using the same hyperon forces as for the $\Lambda$ potential. Specifically, we show that the low-energy constants characterizing the strength of the $YNN$ force can be chosen to suppress the appearance of the $\Lambda$'s in neutron stars while at the same time the empirical value of the $\Sigma$ potential is reproduced.</description>

      <title>Nuclear equation of state at finite $\mu_B$ using deep learning assisted quasi-parton model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately determine the nuclear equation of state (EoS) at finite baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) remains a challenging yet essential goal in the study of QCD matter under extreme conditions. In this study, we develop a deep learning assisted quasi-parton model, which utilizes three deep neural networks, to reconstruct the QCD EoS at zero $\mu_B$ and predict the EoS and transport coefficient $\eta/s$ at finite $\mu_B$. The EoS derived from our quasi-parton model shows excellent agreement with lattice QCD results obtained using Taylor expansion techniques. The minimum value of $\eta/s$ is found to be approximately 175 MeV and decreases with increasing chemical potential within the confidence interval. This model not only provides a robust framework for understanding the properties of the QCD EoS at finite $\mu_B$ but also offers critical input for relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of nuclear matter produced in heavy-ion collisions by the RHIC beam energy scan program.</description>

      <title>From QCD phenomenology to nuclear physics phenomenology: the chiral confining model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework allowing to make an explicit connection between the phenomenology of QCD, namely the properties of the gluon correlator and Wilson loops, and a particular relativistic model for the description of nuclear matter and neutron stars, the chiral confining model. Starting with the Field Correlator Method, which incorporates explicitly and simultaneously confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, we describe how to obtain the response of the composite nucleon to the nuclear scalar field, the relative role of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the in-medium nucleon mass evolution, generating the three-body forces needed for the saturation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a pedagogical exploration of coupled-channel scattering in hadronic physics, focusing on theoretical methodologies, and practical applications. It covers key concepts such as the $N/D$ method, Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson poles, and the generalization of these techniques to coupled channels. The article also presents a parameterization for partial wave amplitudes, ensuring unitarity and analyticity, and addresses scattering near the threshold of dominant channels, with use also of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Additionally, it explores final-state interactions, Omn\`es and Muskhelishvily solutions, the Khuri-Treiman approach, and the two-potential model for resonant event distributions, highlighting the role of Riemann sheets in resonance behavior. These methods are also applicable to related fields like nuclear and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Gluon skewed generalized parton distributions of proton from a light-front Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate all leading-twist gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at nonzero skewness using the basis light-front quantization framework. The proton's light-front wave functions are derived from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian incorporating Quantum Chromodynamics inputs. Our results show that the qualitative behaviors of the GPDs are consistent with those from other theoretical calculations. Additionally, we analyze the GPDs in the boost-invariant longitudinal coordinate, $\sigma=\frac{1}{2} b^- P^+$, which serves as the Fourier conjugate of the skewness. The GPDs in $\sigma$-space exhibit diffraction patterns, reminiscent of optical wave diffraction.</description>

      <title>Pauli principle forbids $\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}$ bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice QCD studies have shown the attractive character of the $^1S_0$ $\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}$, $Q=s,c,b$, interaction, predicting deeply bound states as the mass of the heavy quark increases. This has led to the question of the possible existence of bound states of more than two $\Omega_{QQQ}$ baryons, in particular $\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}\Omega_{QQQ}$ bound states. We discuss how these states might not exist in nature in any flavor sector. The reason would be due to the simultaneous action of two consequences of the Pauli principle in the different partial waves: one at the baryon level, affecting the $^1S_0$ partial wave, and the other due to the quark substructure, affecting the $^5S_2$ partial wave.</description>

      <title>$\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ tribaryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possible existence of bound states of three $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons. We consider only $S$ wave interactions and we start from recent lattice QCD results which give a strongly attractive potential between two $\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons in the $^1S_0$ channel. We analyze different scenarios. At baryonic level, the $\Omega_{bbb}\Omega_{bbb}$ interaction could be understood to be basically spin-independent, so that the two contributing channels, $^1S_0$ and $^5S_2$, would have a very similar interaction. This baryonic analysis leads to the existence of bound states in the three-body system. At the quark level, repulsive effects would appear in the $^5S_2$ channel, making it more repulsive than the $^1S_0$ channel. We study the effect of such repulsion in terms of its range.</description>

      <title>Evolution of structure functions in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the momentum-space Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations for structure functions measurable in deeply inelastic scattering. We construct a six-dimensional basis of structure functions that allows for a full three flavor structure and thereby provides a way to calculate perturbative predictions for physical cross sections directly without unobservable parton distribution functions (PDFs) and without the associated scheme dependence. We derive the DGLAP equations to first non-zero order in strong coupling $\alpha_s$, but the approach can be pursued to arbitrary order in perturbation theory. We also numerically check our equations against the conventional PDF formulation.</description>

      <title>A potential approach to the $X(3872)$ thermal behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of $X(3872)$ at finite temperature in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation under the assumption that it is a tetraquark. We argue that, at large number of colors, it is a good approximation to assume that the potential consists in a real part plus a constant imaginary term. The real part is then computed adapting an approach by Rothkopf and Lafferty and using as input lattice QCD determinations of the potential for hybrids. This model allows us to qualitatively estimate at which temperature range the formation of a heavy tetraquark is possible, and to propose a qualitative picture for the dissociation of the state in a medium. Our approach can be applied to other suggested internal structures for the $X(3872)$ and to other exotic states.</description>

      <title>Probing nonperturbative transverse momentum dependent PDFs with chiral perturbation theory: the $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use chiral perturbation theory to study the long distance regime of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs). Chiral corrections to the TMD PDFs are computed from proton to pion/baryon splittings. For consistent power counting, we find that the fraction of the proton's momentum that a pion may carry must be kept small. We make predictions for a $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry in the proton's TMD PDFs and find that the effective theory gives a natural exponential suppression of the TMD PDF at long distances. We then explore the effects that additional nonperturbative physics may have on the TMD $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of instantons and anti-instantons. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>
