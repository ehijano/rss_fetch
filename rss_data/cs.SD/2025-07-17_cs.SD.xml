      <title>Towards Scalable AASIST: Refining Graph Attention for Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in voice conversion and text-to-speech synthesis have made automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems more susceptible to spoofing attacks. This work explores modest refinements to the AASIST anti-spoofing architecture. It incorporates a frozen Wav2Vec 2.0 encoder to retain self-supervised speech representations in limited-data settings, substitutes the original graph attention block with a standardized multi-head attention module using heterogeneous query projections, and replaces heuristic frame-segment fusion with a trainable, context-aware integration layer. When evaluated on the ASVspoof 5 corpus, the proposed system reaches a 7.6\% equal error rate (EER), improving on a re-implemented AASIST baseline under the same training conditions. Ablation experiments suggest that each architectural change contributes to the overall performance, indicating that targeted adjustments to established models may help strengthen speech deepfake detection in practical scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/KORALLLL/AASIST_SCALING.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Data Fusion Generative Adversarial Network for Real Time Underwater Sound Speed Field Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound speed profiles (SSPs) are essential parameters underwater that affects the propagation mode of underwater signals and has a critical impact on the energy efficiency of underwater acoustic communication and accuracy of underwater acoustic positioning. Traditionally, SSPs can be obtained by matching field processing (MFP), compressive sensing (CS), and deep learning (DL) methods. However, existing methods mainly rely on on-site underwater sonar observation data, which put forward strict requirements on the deployment of sonar observation systems. To achieve high-precision estimation of sound velocity distribution in a given sea area without on-site underwater data measurement, we propose a multi-modal data-fusion generative adversarial network model with residual attention block (MDF-RAGAN) for SSP construction. To improve the model's ability for capturing global spatial feature correlations, we embedded the attention mechanisms, and use residual modules for deeply capturing small disturbances in the deep ocean sound velocity distribution caused by changes of SST. Experimental results on real open dataset show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which achieves an accuracy with an error of less than 0.3m/s. Specifically, MDF-RAGAN not only outperforms convolutional neural network (CNN) and spatial interpolation (SITP) by nearly a factor of two, but also achieves about 65.8\% root mean square error (RMSE) reduction compared to mean profile, which fully reflects the enhancement of overall profile matching by multi-source fusion and cross-modal attention.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Bridge Consistency Trajectory Models for Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) utilizing diffusion models is a promising technology that improves speech quality in noisy speech data. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to improve speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the forward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB still exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of function evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While Consistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training that uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation, it does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a solution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only accelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between quality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM techniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present Schr\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the CTM's technique to the Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce a novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's training framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x improvement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between quality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting multi-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient. Our code, pretrained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/sony/sbctm/.</description>

      <title>EME-TTS: Unlocking the Emphasis and Emotion Link in Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, emotional Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis and emphasis-controllable speech synthesis have advanced significantly. However, their interaction remains underexplored. We propose Emphasis Meets Emotion TTS (EME-TTS), a novel framework designed to address two key research questions: (1) how to effectively utilize emphasis to enhance the expressiveness of emotional speech, and (2) how to maintain the perceptual clarity and stability of target emphasis across different emotions. EME-TTS employs weakly supervised learning with emphasis pseudo-labels and variance-based emphasis features. Additionally, the proposed Emphasis Perception Enhancement (EPE) block enhances the interaction between emotional signals and emphasis positions. Experimental results show that EME-TTS, when combined with large language models for emphasis position prediction, enables more natural emotional speech synthesis while preserving stable and distinguishable target emphasis across emotions. Synthesized samples are available on-line.</description>

      <title>Stereo Sound Event Localization and Detection with Onscreen/offscreen Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3 of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change shifts the focus from more specialized 360{\deg} audio and audiovisual scene analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data, the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane (left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric, which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs reasonably well with the stereo audio data.</description>

      <title>MambaRate: Speech Quality Assessment Across Different Sampling Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MambaRate, which predicts Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with limited bias regarding the sampling rate of the waveform under evaluation. It is designed for Track 3 of the AudioMOS Challenge 2025, which focuses on predicting MOS for speech in high sampling frequencies. Our model leverages self-supervised embeddings and selective state space modeling. The target ratings are encoded in a continuous representation via Gaussian radial basis functions (RBF). The results of the challenge were based on the system-level Spearman's Rank Correllation Coefficient (SRCC) metric. An initial MambaRate version (T16 system) outperformed the pre-trained baseline (B03) by ~14% in a few-shot setting without pre-training. T16 ranked fourth out of five in the challenge, differing by ~6% from the winning system. We present additional results on the BVCC dataset as well as ablations with different representations as input, which outperform the initial T16 version.</description>

      <title>Room Impulse Response Generation Conditioned on Acoustic Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of room impulse responses (RIRs) using deep neural networks has attracted growing research interest due to its applications in virtual and augmented reality, audio postproduction, and related fields. Most existing approaches condition generative models on physical descriptions of a room, such as its size, shape, and surface materials. However, this reliance on geometric information limits their usability in scenarios where the room layout is unknown or when perceptual realism (how a space sounds to a listener) is more important than strict physical accuracy. In this study, we propose an alternative strategy: conditioning RIR generation directly on a set of RIR acoustic parameters. These parameters include various measures of reverberation time and direct sound to reverberation ratio, both broadband and bandwise. By specifying how the space should sound instead of how it should look, our method enables more flexible and perceptually driven RIR generation. We explore both autoregressive and non-autoregressive generative models operating in the Descript Audio Codec domain, using either discrete token sequences or continuous embeddings. Specifically, we have selected four models to evaluate: an autoregressive transformer, the MaskGIT model, a flow matching model, and a classifier-based approach. Objective and subjective evaluations are performed to compare these methods with state-of-the-art alternatives. Results show that the proposed models match or outperform state-of-the-art alternatives, with the MaskGIT model achieving the best performance.</description>

      <title>RUMAA: Repeat-Aware Unified Music Audio Analysis for Score-Performance Alignment, Transcription, and Mistake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment, score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while also delivering promising transcription and mistake detection results.</description>

      <title>Quantize More, Lose Less: Autoregressive Generation from Residually Quantized Speech Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances, speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies: the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity, general-purpose speech and audio generation.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Multimode Waveguides Based on Large Step Size AdaMax from Far-Field Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing multimode waveguide performance depends on modal analysis; however, current approaches focus predominantly on modal power distribution and, limited by experimental hardware and conditions, exhibit low accuracy, poor adaptability, and high computational cost. In this work, under a power-normalization constraint, we employ the AdaMax optimizer with a large-step-size strategy to perform modal analysis of multimode waveguides from far-field amplitude measurements. Our method retrieves both the modal power distribution and the modal relative-phase distribution, and we elucidate how twin-image ambiguity limits the capability to analyze modal relative-phase distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well for both rectangular and circular waveguides, maintaining high accuracy and robustness under noise with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 20 to 120 dB, and achieving substantial improvements in accuracy and computational cost over comparable methods. This method provides a novel solution for modal analysis with broad application potential.</description>

      <title>Exploring Gender Bias in Alzheimer's Disease Detection: Insights from Mandarin and Greek Speech Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for further research to validate model performance across different linguistic contexts.</description>

      <title>Epic-Sounds: A Large-scale Dataset of Actions That Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EPIC-SOUNDS, a large-scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos. We propose an annotation pipeline where annotators temporally label distinguishable audio segments and describe the action that could have caused this sound. We identify actions that can be discriminated purely from audio, through grouping these free-form descriptions of audio into classes. For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human annotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed on a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities. Overall, EPIC-SOUNDS includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised segments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and detection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods. We also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the temporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the ambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of audio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions that sound.</description>

      <title>Miipher-2: A Universal Speech Restoration Model for Million-Hour Scale Data Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training data cleaning is a new application for generative model-based speech restoration (SR). This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaveFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.</description>

Abstract: Temporal envelope morphing, the process of interpolating between the amplitude dynamics of two audio signals, is an emerging problem in generative audio systems that lacks sufficient perceptual grounding. Morphing of temporal envelopes in a perceptually intuitive manner should enable new methods for sound blending in creative media and for probing perceptual organization in psychoacoustics. However, existing audio morphing techniques often fail to produce intermediate temporal envelopes when input sounds have distinct temporal structures; many morphers effectively overlay both temporal structures, leading to perceptually unnatural results. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow for learning envelope morphing with perceptual guidance: we first derive perceptually grounded morphing principles through human listening studies, then synthesize large-scale datasets encoding these principles, and finally train machine learning models to create perceptually intermediate morphs. Specifically, we present: (1) perceptual principles that guide envelope morphing, derived from our listening studies, (2) a supervised framework to learn these principles, (3) an autoencoder that learns to compress temporal envelope structures into latent representations, and (4) benchmarks for evaluating audio envelope morphs, using both synthetic and naturalistic data, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods in producing temporally intermediate morphs. All code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>JIS: A Speech Corpus of Japanese Idol Speakers with Various Speaking Styles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Japanese Idol Speech Corpus (JIS) to advance research in speech generation AI, including text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and voice conversion (VC). JIS will facilitate more rigorous evaluations of speaker similarity in TTS and VC systems since all speakers in JIS belong to a highly specific category: "young female live idols" in Japan, and each speaker is identified by a stage name, enabling researchers to recruit listeners familiar with these idols for listening experiments. With its unique speaker attributes, JIS will foster compelling research, including generating voices tailored to listener preferences-an area not yet widely studied. JIS will be distributed free of charge to promote research in speech generation AI, with usage restricted to non-commercial, basic research. We describe the construction of JIS, provide an overview of Japanese live idol culture to support effective and ethical use of JIS, and offer a basic analysis to guide application of JIS.</description>

      <title>Diffused Responsibility: Analyzing the Energy Consumption of Generative Text-to-Audio Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13017v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Direct Duplex Modeling for Speech-to-Speech Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.</description>
