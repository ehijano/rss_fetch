      <title>SelfAge: Personalized Facial Age Transformation Using Self-reference Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age transformation of facial images is a technique that edits age-related person's appearances while preserving the identity. Existing deep learning-based methods can reproduce natural age transformations; however, they only reproduce averaged transitions and fail to account for individual-specific appearances influenced by their life histories. In this paper, we propose the first diffusion model-based method for personalized age transformation. Our diffusion model takes a facial image and a target age as input and generates an age-edited face image as output. To reflect individual-specific features, we incorporate additional supervision using self-reference images, which are facial images of the same person at different ages. Specifically, we fine-tune a pretrained diffusion model for personalized adaptation using approximately 3 to 5 self-reference images. Additionally, we design an effective prompt to enhance the performance of age editing and identity preservation. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to existing methods. The code and the pretrained model are available at https://github.com/shiiiijp/SelfAge.</description>

      <title>Generative Detail Enhancement for Physically Based Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a tool for enhancing the detail of physically based materials using an off-the-shelf diffusion model and inverse rendering. Our goal is to enhance the visual fidelity of materials with detail that is often tedious to author, by adding signs of wear, aging, weathering, etc. As these appearance details are often rooted in real-world processes, we leverage a generative image model trained on a large dataset of natural images with corresponding visuals in context. Starting with a given geometry, UV mapping, and basic appearance, we render multiple views of the object. We use these views, together with an appearance-defining text prompt, to condition a diffusion model. The details it generates are then backpropagated from the enhanced images to the material parameters via inverse differentiable rendering. For inverse rendering to be successful, the generated appearance has to be consistent across all the images. We propose two priors to address the multi-view consistency of the diffusion model. First, we ensure that the initial noise that seeds the diffusion process is itself consistent across views by integrating it from a view-independent UV space. Second, we enforce geometric consistency by biasing the attention mechanism via a projective constraint so that pixels attend strongly to their corresponding pixel locations in other views. Our approach does not require any training or finetuning of the diffusion model, is agnostic of the material model used, and the enhanced material properties, i.e., 2D PBR textures, can be further edited by artists.</description>

      <title>FantasyID: Face Knowledge Enhanced ID-Preserving Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning-free approaches adapting large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models for identity-preserving text-to-video generation (IPT2V) have gained popularity recently due to their efficacy and scalability. However, significant challenges remain to achieve satisfied facial dynamics while keeping the identity unchanged. In this work, we present a novel tuning-free IPT2V framework by enhancing face knowledge of the pre-trained video model built on diffusion transformers (DiT), dubbed FantasyID. Essentially, 3D facial geometry prior is incorporated to ensure plausible facial structures during video synthesis. To prevent the model from learning copy-paste shortcuts that simply replicate reference face across frames, a multi-view face augmentation strategy is devised to capture diverse 2D facial appearance features, hence increasing the dynamics over the facial expressions and head poses. Additionally, after blending the 2D and 3D features as guidance, instead of naively employing cross-attention to inject guidance cues into DiT layers, a learnable layer-aware adaptive mechanism is employed to selectively inject the fused features into each individual DiT layers, facilitating balanced modeling of identity preservation and motion dynamics. Experimental results validate our model's superiority over the current tuning-free IPT2V methods.</description>

      <title>SigStyle: Signature Style Transfer via Personalized Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Style transfer enables the seamless integration of artistic styles from a style image into a content image, resulting in visually striking and aesthetically enriched outputs. Despite numerous advances in this field, existing methods did not explicitly focus on the signature style, which represents the distinct and recognizable visual traits of the image such as geometric and structural patterns, color palettes and brush strokes etc. In this paper, we introduce SigStyle, a framework that leverages the semantic priors that embedded in a personalized text-to-image diffusion model to capture the signature style representation. This style capture process is powered by a hypernetwork that efficiently fine-tunes the diffusion model for any given single style image. Style transfer then is conceptualized as the reconstruction process of content image through learned style tokens from the personalized diffusion model. Additionally, to ensure the content consistency throughout the style transfer process, we introduce a time-aware attention swapping technique that incorporates content information from the original image into the early denoising steps of target image generation. Beyond enabling high-quality signature style transfer across a wide range of styles, SigStyle supports multiple interesting applications, such as local style transfer, texture transfer, style fusion and style-guided text-to-image generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate our approach outperforms existing style transfer methods for recognizing and transferring the signature styles.</description>

      <title>DP-Adapter: Dual-Pathway Adapter for Boosting Fidelity and Text Consistency in Customizable Human Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing popularity of personalized human content creation and sharing, there is a rising demand for advanced techniques in customized human image generation. However, current methods struggle to simultaneously maintain the fidelity of human identity and ensure the consistency of textual prompts, often resulting in suboptimal outcomes. This shortcoming is primarily due to the lack of effective constraints during the simultaneous integration of visual and textual prompts, leading to unhealthy mutual interference that compromises the full expression of both types of input. Building on prior research that suggests visual and textual conditions influence different regions of an image in distinct ways, we introduce a novel Dual-Pathway Adapter (DP-Adapter) to enhance both high-fidelity identity preservation and textual consistency in personalized human image generation. Our approach begins by decoupling the target human image into visually sensitive and text-sensitive regions. For visually sensitive regions, DP-Adapter employs an Identity-Enhancing Adapter (IEA) to preserve detailed identity features. For text-sensitive regions, we introduce a Textual-Consistency Adapter (TCA) to minimize visual interference and ensure the consistency of textual semantics. To seamlessly integrate these pathways, we develop a Fine-Grained Feature-Level Blending (FFB) module that efficiently combines hierarchical semantic features from both pathways, resulting in more natural and coherent synthesis outcomes. Additionally, DP-Adapter supports various innovative applications, including controllable headshot-to-full-body portrait generation, age editing, old-photo to reality, and expression editing.</description>

      <title>Inter3D: A Benchmark and Strong Baseline for Human-Interactive 3D Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in implicit 3D reconstruction methods, e.g., neural rendering fields and Gaussian splatting, have primarily focused on novel view synthesis of static or dynamic objects with continuous motion states. However, these approaches struggle to efficiently model a human-interactive object with n movable parts, requiring 2^n separate models to represent all discrete states. To overcome this limitation, we propose Inter3D, a new benchmark and approach for novel state synthesis of human-interactive objects. We introduce a self-collected dataset featuring commonly encountered interactive objects and a new evaluation pipeline, where only individual part states are observed during training, while part combination states remain unseen. We also propose a strong baseline approach that leverages Space Discrepancy Tensors to efficiently modelling all states of an object. To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts. In addition, we explore two occupancy grid sampling strategies to facilitate training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark, showcasing the challenges of the task and the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>Im2SurfTex: Surface Texture Generation via Neural Backprojection of Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Im2SurfTex, a method that generates textures for input 3D shapes by learning to aggregate multi-view image outputs produced by 2D image diffusion models onto the shapes' texture space. Unlike existing texture generation techniques that use ad hoc backprojection and averaging schemes to blend multiview images into textures, often resulting in texture seams and artifacts, our approach employs a trained, feedforward neural module to boost texture coherency. The key ingredient of our module is to leverage neural attention and appropriate positional encodings of image pixels based on their corresponding 3D point positions, normals, and surface-aware coordinates as encoded in geodesic distances within surface patches. These encodings capture texture correlations between neighboring surface points, ensuring better texture continuity. Experimental results show that our module improves texture quality, achieving superior performance in high-resolution texture generation.</description>

      <title>d-Sketch: Improving Visual Fidelity of Sketch-to-Image Translation with Pretrained Latent Diffusion Models without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural guidance in an image-to-image translation allows intricate control over the shapes of synthesized images. Generating high-quality realistic images from user-specified rough hand-drawn sketches is one such task that aims to impose a structural constraint on the conditional generation process. While the premise is intriguing for numerous use cases of content creation and academic research, the problem becomes fundamentally challenging due to substantial ambiguities in freehand sketches. Furthermore, balancing the trade-off between shape consistency and realistic generation contributes to additional complexity in the process. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generally utilize conditional GANs or GAN inversions, often requiring application-specific data and optimization objectives. The recent introduction of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieves a generational leap for low-level visual attributes in general image synthesis. However, directly retraining a large-scale diffusion model on a domain-specific subtask is often extremely difficult due to demanding computation costs and insufficient data. In this paper, we introduce a technique for sketch-to-image translation by exploiting the feature generalization capabilities of a large-scale diffusion model without retraining. In particular, we use a learnable lightweight mapping network to achieve latent feature translation from source to target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing techniques in qualitative and quantitative benchmarks, allowing high-resolution realistic image synthesis from rough hand-drawn sketches.</description>

      <title>Appeal prediction for AI up-scaled Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNN- or AI-based up-scaling algorithms are gaining in popularity due to the improvements in machine learning. Various up-scaling models using CNNs, GANs or mixed approaches have been published. The majority of models are evaluated using PSRN and SSIM or only a few example images. However, a performance evaluation with a wide range of real-world images and subjective evaluation is missing, which we tackle in the following paper. For this reason, we describe our developed dataset, which uses 136 base images and five different up-scaling methods, namely Real-ESRGAN, BSRGAN, waifu2x, KXNet, and Lanczos. Overall the dataset consists of 1496 annotated images. The labeling of our dataset focused on image appeal and has been performed using crowd-sourcing employing our open-source tool AVRate Voyager. We evaluate the appeal of the different methods, and the results indicate that Real-ESRGAN and BSRGAN are the best. Furthermore, we train a DNN to detect which up-scaling method has been used, the trained models have a good overall performance in our evaluation. In addition to this, we evaluate state-of-the-art image appeal and quality models, here none of the models showed a high prediction performance, therefore we also trained two own approaches. The first uses transfer learning and has the best performance, and the second model uses signal-based features and a random forest model with good overall performance. We share the data and implementation to allow further research in the context of open science.</description>

      <title>NeRF-3DTalker: Neural Radiance Field with 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement for Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Talking head synthesis is to synthesize a lip-synchronized talking head video using audio. Recently, the capability of NeRF to enhance the realism and texture details of synthesized talking heads has attracted the attention of researchers. However, most current NeRF methods based on audio are exclusively concerned with the rendering of frontal faces. These methods are unable to generate clear talking heads in novel views. Another prevalent challenge in current 3D talking head synthesis is the difficulty in aligning acoustic and visual spaces, which often results in suboptimal lip-syncing of the generated talking heads. To address these issues, we propose Neural Radiance Field with 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement for Talking Head Synthesis (NeRF-3DTalker). Specifically, the proposed method employs 3D prior information to synthesize clear talking heads with free views. Additionally, we propose a 3D Prior Aided Audio Disentanglement module, which is designed to disentangle the audio into two distinct categories: features related to 3D awarded speech movements and features related to speaking style. Moreover, to reposition the generated frames that are distant from the speaker's motion space in the real space, we have devised a local-global Standardized Space. This method normalizes the irregular positions in the generated frames from both global and local semantic perspectives. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it has been demonstrated that our NeRF-3DTalker outperforms state-of-the-art in synthesizing realistic talking head videos, exhibiting superior image quality and lip synchronization.

      <title>Pandora3D: A Comprehensive Framework for High-Quality 3D Shape and Texture Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive framework for generating high-quality 3D shapes and textures from diverse input prompts, including single images, multi-view images, and text descriptions. The framework consists of 3D shape generation and texture generation. (1). The 3D shape generation pipeline employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode implicit 3D geometries into a latent space and a diffusion network to generate latents conditioned on input prompts, with modifications to enhance model capacity. An alternative Artist-Created Mesh (AM) generation approach is also explored, yielding promising results for simpler geometries. (2). Texture generation involves a multi-stage process starting with frontal images generation followed by multi-view images generation, RGB-to-PBR texture conversion, and high-resolution multi-view texture refinement. A consistency scheduler is plugged into every stage, to enforce pixel-wise consistency among multi-view textures during inference, ensuring seamless integration.
  The pipeline demonstrates effective handling of diverse input formats, leveraging advanced neural architectures and novel methodologies to produce high-quality 3D content. This report details the system architecture, experimental results, and potential future directions to improve and expand the framework. The source code and pretrained weights are released at: \url{https://github.com/Tencent/Tencent-XR-3DGen}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flatbed scanners have emerged as promising devices for high-resolution, single-image material capture. However, existing approaches assume very specific conditions, such as uniform diffuse illumination, which are only available in certain high-end devices, hindering their scalability and cost. In contrast, in this work, we introduce a method inspired by intrinsic image decomposition, which accurately removes both shading and specularity, effectively allowing captures with any flatbed scanner. Further, we extend previous work on single-image material reflectance capture with the estimation of opacity and transmittance, critical components of full material appearance (SVBSDF), improving the results for any material captured with a flatbed scanner, at a very high resolution and accuracy</description>

      <title>CDGS: Confidence-Aware Depth Regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown significant advantages in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly in achieving high rendering speeds and high-quality results. However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications.</description>

Abstract: Personalizing generative text-to-image models has seen remarkable progress, but extending this personalization to text-to-video models presents unique challenges. Unlike static concepts, personalizing text-to-video models has the potential to capture dynamic concepts, i.e., entities defined not only by their appearance but also by their motion. In this paper, we introduce Set-and-Sequence, a novel framework for personalizing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)-based generative video models with dynamic concepts. Our approach imposes a spatio-temporal weight space within an architecture that does not explicitly separate spatial and temporal features. This is achieved in two key stages. First, we fine-tune Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers using an unordered set of frames from the video to learn an identity LoRA basis that represents the appearance, free from temporal interference. In the second stage, with the identity LoRAs frozen, we augment their coefficients with Motion Residuals and fine-tune them on the full video sequence, capturing motion dynamics. Our Set-and-Sequence framework results in a spatio-temporal weight space that effectively embeds dynamic concepts into the video model's output domain, enabling unprecedented editability and compositionality while setting a new benchmark for personalizing dynamic concepts.</description>

Abstract: Human motion is highly diverse and dynamic, posing challenges for imitation learning algorithms that aim to generalize motor skills for controlling simulated characters. Previous methods typically rely on a universal full-body controller for tracking reference motion (tracking-based model) or a unified full-body skill embedding space (skill embedding). However, these approaches often struggle to generalize and scale to larger motion datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel skill learning framework, ModSkill, that decouples complex full-body skills into compositional, modular skills for independent body parts. Our framework features a skill modularization attention layer that processes policy observations into modular skill embeddings that guide low-level controllers for each body part. We also propose an Active Skill Learning approach with Generative Adaptive Sampling, using large motion generation models to adaptively enhance policy learning in challenging tracking scenarios. Our results show that this modularized skill learning framework, enhanced by generative sampling, outperforms existing methods in precise full-body motion tracking and enables reusable skill embeddings for diverse goal-driven tasks.</description>

      <title>DeepFracture: A Generative Approach for Predicting Brittle Fractures with Neural Discrete Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: In the field of brittle fracture animation, generating realistic destruction animations using physics-based simulation methods is computationally expensive. While techniques based on Voronoi diagrams or pre-fractured patterns are effective for real-time applications, they fail to incorporate collision conditions when determining fractured shapes during runtime. This paper introduces a novel learning-based approach for predicting fractured shapes based on collision dynamics at runtime. Our approach seamlessly integrates realistic brittle fracture animations with rigid body simulations, utilising boundary element method (BEM) brittle fracture simulations to generate training data. To integrate collision scenarios and fractured shapes into a deep learning framework, we introduce generative geometric segmentation, distinct from both instance and semantic segmentation, to represent 3D fragment shapes. We propose an eight-dimensional latent code to address the challenge of optimising multiple discrete fracture pattern targets that share similar continuous collision latent codes. This code will follow a discrete normal distribution corresponding to a specific fracture pattern within our latent impulse representation design. This adaptation enables the prediction of fractured shapes using neural discrete representation learning. Our experimental results show that our approach generates considerably more detailed brittle fractures than existing techniques, while the computational time is typically reduced compared to traditional simulation methods at comparable resolutions.</description>

Abstract: The web-based dynamic geometry software CindyJS is a versatile tool to create interactive applications for mathematics and other topics. In this workshop, we will look at a code package that makes the creation of animations in CindyJS easier and more streamlined. Animations, which can then be embedded into presentations or be used in (lecture) videos. The focus lies on the creation of the animations themselves and some of the technical and artistic fundamentals to do so.</description>

      <title>FlexControl: Computation-Aware ControlNet with Differentiable Router for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ControlNet offers a powerful way to guide diffusion-based generative models, yet most implementations rely on ad-hoc heuristics to choose which network blocks to control-an approach that varies unpredictably with different tasks. To address this gap, we propose FlexControl, a novel framework that copies all diffusion blocks during training and employs a trainable gating mechanism to dynamically select which blocks to activate at each denoising step. With introducing a computation-aware loss, we can encourage control blocks only to activate when it benefit the generation quality. By eliminating manual block selection, FlexControl enhances adaptability across diverse tasks and streamlines the design pipeline, with computation-aware training loss in an end-to-end training manner. Through comprehensive experiments on both UNet (e.g., SD1.5) and DiT (e.g., SD3.0), we show that our method outperforms existing ControlNet variants in certain key aspects of interest. As evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, FlexControl preserves or enhances image fidelity while also reducing computational overhead by selectively activating the most relevant blocks. These results underscore the potential of a flexible, data-driven approach for controlled diffusion and open new avenues for efficient generative model design. The code will soon be available at https://github.com/Anonymousuuser/FlexControl.</description>
