      <title>Gravitational aggregation regimes: critical dissipation threshold, optimal rigidity and fractal transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a three-dimensional Discrete Element Method study of self-gravitation and contact mechanics in cold granular assemblies. The model couples direct Newtonian attraction between every particle pair with a linear visco-elastic normal contact law. Particles are treated as non-cohesive spheres; the normal force is parameterized to reproduce a prescribed restitution coefficient. Rotations are integrated using quaternions to avoid singularities. By normalizing the stiffness kn by kstar = G*m^2/R^3 and time by the free-fall time t_ff, I perform systematic parameter campaigns over dissipation (gamma) and normalized stiffness ktilde = kn/kstar. Results reveal three aggregation regimes. For low gamma the particles remain largely dispersive; above a critical gamma of about 5e2 aggregation accelerates until plateaus are reached in the aggregation time T_agg divided by t_ff. For stiffness ktilde on the order of 1e6 the aggregation time reaches a clear minimum. The cluster fraction C/Ntot shows a non-monotonic dependence on ktilde, with optimal cohesion at intermediate rigidity and peripheral isolation at extreme stiffness. Mapping the fractal dimension F across (gamma, ktilde) demonstrates transitions from compact structures (F about 3) to ramified structures (F below 2). These findings quantify how microscopic contact laws govern both the kinetics and microstructure of gravity-driven aggregation, providing a predictive framework for planetesimal formation and for calibrating DEM models against laboratory and micro-gravity experiments.</description>

      <title>polyRETRO: a Language Model Approach to predict Polymerization Class and Monomer(s) for a Target Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning has transformed polymer design by enabling rapid property prediction and candidate generation, translating these designs into experimentally realizable materials remains a critical challenge. Traditionally, the synthesis of target polymers has relied heavily on expert intuition and prior experience. The lack of automated retrosynthetic tools to assist chemists, limit the rapid practical impact of data-driven polymer discovery. To expedite lab-scale validation and beyond, we present a retrosynthetic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to guide polymer synthesis. Our approach, which we call polyRETRO, involves two key steps: 1) predicting the most likely polymerization reaction class of a target polymer and 2) identifying the underlying chemical transformation templates and the corresponding monomers, using primarily natural-language based constructs. This LLM-driven framework enables direct retrosynthetic analysis given just the target polymer SMILES string. polyRETRO constitutes a initial step towards a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable approach to bridge the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the soft behavior of nematic elastomers over a range of temperature and strain rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nematic elastomers are a particular class of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that exhibit both liquid-crystalline order and rubber (entropic) elasticity. This combination makes them stimuli-responsive soft materials with a number of unusual thermo-mechanical properties. They have been proposed for various applications, including soft robotics, enhanced adhesion, and impact resistance. This paper presents a new experimental setup and a comprehensive dataset characterizing the soft behavior of nematic elastomers over a range of temperatures and strain rates. We also fit the results to a recently developed model of nematic elastomers.</description>

      <title>An Orbifold Framework for Classifying Layer Groups with an Application to Knitted Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled structures such as textiles, polymer networks, and architected metamaterials are often doubly periodic. Due to this property and their finite transverse thickness, the symmetries of these materials are described by the crystallographic layer groups. While orbifold notation provides a compact topological description and classification of the planar wallpaper groups, no analogous framework has been available for the spatial layer groups. In this article we develop an orbifold theory in three dimensions and introduce a complete set of Conway-type symbols for all layer groups. To illustrate its applicability, we analyze several knitted fabric motifs and show how their layer-group symmetries are naturally expressed in this new orbifold notation. This work establishes a foundation for the topological classification of doubly periodic structures beyond the planar setting and supports structure-function analysis in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the boson peak frequency and transverse Ioffe-Regel limit in four-dimensional structural glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of excess vibrational modes over the Debye prediction, typically manifested as the well-known boson peak in the plot of vibrational density of states scaled by the Debye prediction, has become a hallmark of various amorphous solids. The origin of the boson peak has been attracting considerable attention but is still under debate. A popular view is that the position of the boson peak coincides well with that of the Ioffe-Regel limit for transverse modes in both two- and three-dimensional glasses, which is primarily derived from simulation studies of model structural glasses. However, it remains unknown whether the proposed coincidence could be generalized to higher spatial dimensions, and addressing this could contribute to the advancement of relevant phenomenological theories. Here, we find that the transverse Ioffe-Regel limit frequency is higher than and not proportional to the boson peak frequency in our studied four-dimensional glasses. Our findings therefore suggest that the proposed coincidence between the boson peak frequency and the transverse Ioffe-Regel limit depends on spatial dimensions, which was not anticipated previously.</description>

      <title>Equation of state for the hard sphere fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the survey of the literatures on the new improvements on the equation of state (EOS) for the hard sphere fluids, we here compare lots of different EOSs and present a very accurate equation of state for this kind of fluids. The new equation is built up on the basis of (1) the best estimated virial coefficients B5-B11 by Tian et al. [ Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019, 21, 13070] and (2) the newest numerical simulation data of the compressibility factor versus the density by Pieprzyk et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2019, 21, 6886]. Our results show that this equation is accurate in not only the stable density range but also the metastable density range with the proper closest packing fraction pole, and well derives the predictive values of the high order virial coefficients B13-B16.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Heliconical Smectic Superstructure in Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The groundbreaking discovery of the ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase has attracted broad interest owing to its pronounced polarization properties and high fluidity. Building on this, the emergent spontaneous chiral order in achiral molecular systems, such as the heliconical ferroelectric nematic phase (NTBF) and the polar heliconical smectic C phase (SmC_P^H), has been discovered, revealing a new form in hierarchical polar order: hierarchical symmetry breaking. Here we report a newly designed achiral molecule that exhibits a hierarchical polar phase sequence: ferroelectric smectic A-NTBF-helielectric conical-SmC_P^H phases. We confirm that the SmC_P^H phase can form a stable macroscopic orientation under an electric field, without any alignment layer. Remarkably, we unlock the unprecedented functionality of the SmC_P^H phase: ultralow-voltage and low-frequency-driven modulation of the helical pitch and its associated enhanced second-harmonic generation. These results demonstrate emergent functionality of polar fluids arising from hierarchical symmetry breaking and offering a new paradigm for polar soft-matter photonics.</description>

      <title>Observation-Time-Induced Crossover from Fluctuating Diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dynamical transition -- seen as a sudden increase in the mean-squared displacement at a characteristic temperature that depends on the observation time -- is widely reported in neutron-scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated proteins. However, its physical origin remains elusive. We show that fluctuating diffusivity in a Langevin framework leads to an observation-time-induced crossover, where the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits a temperature-dependent transition whose crossover point shifts with observation time. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal the mechanism of this crossover and delineate the conditions under which it emerges. Our findings provide a unified nonequilibrium interpretation for observation-time-induced crossover, and suggest that the protein dynamical transition can be viewed as an instance of this general crossover mechanism.</description>

      <title>Nature of continuous spectra in wall-bounded shearing flows of FENE-P fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to the spatially local nature of the constitutive equations typically used to model polymeric stresses, the differential operators governing the linearized dynamics of bounded viscoelastic shearing flows have singular points. As a result, the eigenspectra of such shearing flows contain, in addition to discrete eigenvalues, continuous spectra (CS) comprising singular eigenfunctions. A clear understanding of the theoretical CS loci is crucial in discriminating physically genuine (discrete) eigenvalues from the poorly approximated numerical CS. For rectilinear shear flows of Oldroyd-B fluids, the CS are a pair of line segments, with lengths equal to the base-state range of velocities. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive account of the nature of the CS for both rectilinear and curvilinear shearing flows of the FENE-P fluid. In stark contrast to the CS for the Oldroyd-B fluid mentioned above, we show analytically that there are up to six distinct continuous spectra for shearing flows of FENE-P fluids. When the finite extensibility parameter $L &gt; 50$, as appropriate for large molecular weight polymers used in experiments, three of the CS are nearly identical, and independent of the solvent-to-solution viscosity ratio ($\beta$). The other three CS are $\beta$-dependent, with one of them being the analogue of the solvent (viscous) continuous spectrum in the Oldroyd-B fluid. The remaining two $\beta$-dependent CS are novel features of the FENE-P spectrum, and can have phase speeds outside the base range of velocities, including negative ones. The complexity of the CS predicted here for shearing flows of FENE-P fluids is expected to carry over to other nonlinear viscoelastic models that exhibit a shear-thinning rheology.</description>

      <title>Anti-aligning Self-propelled Model of Two Species: Emergence of Self-organized Heterogeneous Aligned and Clustered Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.</description>

      <title>Short-wavelength mesophases in the ground states of core-softened particles in two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the formation of short-wavelength mesophases in a two-dimensional core-softened particle system. By proposing a series of specific ansatz for each relevant phase, we performed a variational analysis to obtain the ground-state phase diagram. Our results reveal a variety of cluster lattice phases with distinct cluster orientations, alongside traditional two-dimensional Bravais lattices such as square, triangular, oblique, and rectangular structures, as well as other non-Bravais arrangements including honeycomb and kagome phases. We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. Finally, our analytical results are confronted with extensive molecular dynamics simulations, which interestingly show the existence of decagonal and dodecagonal quasicrystalline phases in regions of the phase diagram that exhibit a high degree of frustration. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.</description>

      <title>Yielding and memory in a driven mean-field model of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors, which lack a unified theoretical description. Here, we study a mean-field model, recently shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. The driven mean-field model, featuring a disordered Hamiltonian structure, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features an oscillatory yielding transition, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system, along with memory formation.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity and conservation laws in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. Notably, non-linear damping destroys hyperuniformity in hyperuniform fluids. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems.</description>
