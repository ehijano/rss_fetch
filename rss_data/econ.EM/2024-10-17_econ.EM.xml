      <title>Testing Identifying Assumptions in Parametric Separable Models: A Conditional Moment Inequality Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple method for testing identifying assumptions in parametric separable models, namely treatment exogeneity, instrument validity, and/or homoskedasticity. We show that the testable implications can be written in the intersection bounds framework, which is easy to implement using the inference method proposed in Chernozhukov, Lee, and Rosen (2013), and the Stata package of Chernozhukov et al. (2015). Monte Carlo simulations confirm that our test is consistent and controls size. We use our proposed method to test the validity of some commonly used instrumental variables, such as the average price in other markets in Nevo and Rosen (2012), the Bartik instrument in Card (2009), and the test rejects both instrumental variable models. When the identifying assumptions are rejected, we discuss solutions that allow researchers to identify some causal parameters of interest after relaxing functional form assumptions. We show that the IV model is nontestable if no functional form assumption is made on the outcome equation, when there exists a one-to-one mapping between the continuous treatment variable, the instrument, and the first-stage unobserved heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>A Simple Interactive Fixed Effects Estimator for Short Panels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interactive effects (IE) model as an extension of the conventional additive effects (AE) model. For the AE model, the fixed effects estimator can be obtained by applying least squares to a regression that adds a linear projection of the fixed effect on the explanatory variables (Mundlak, 1978; Chamberlain, 1984). In this paper, we develop a novel estimator -- the projection-based IE (PIE) estimator -- for the IE model that is based on a similar approach. We show that, for the IE model, fixed effects estimators that have appeared in the literature are not equivalent to our PIE estimator, though both can be expressed as a generalized within estimator. Unlike the fixed effects estimators for the IE model, the PIE estimator is consistent for a fixed number of time periods with no restrictions on serial correlation or conditional heteroskedasticity in the errors. We also derive a statistic for testing the consistency of the two-way fixed effects estimator in the possible presence of iterative effects. Moreover, although the PIE estimator is the solution to a high-dimensional nonlinear least squares problem, we show that it can be computed by iterating between two steps, both of which have simple analytical solutions. The computational simplicity is an important advantage relative to other strategies that have been proposed for estimating the IE model for short panels. Finally, we compare the finite sample performance of IE estimators through simulations.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Analysis in Empirical Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address counterfactual analysis in empirical models of games with partially identified parameters, and multiple equilibria and/or randomized strategies, by constructing and analyzing the counterfactual predictive distribution set (CPDS). This framework accommodates various outcomes of interest, including behavioral and welfare outcomes. It allows a variety of changes to the environment to generate the counterfactual, including modifications of the utility functions, the distribution of utility determinants, the number of decision makers, and the solution concept. We use a Bayesian approach to summarize statistical uncertainty. We establish conditions under which the population CPDS is sharp from the point of view of identification. We also establish conditions under which the posterior CPDS is consistent if the posterior distribution for the underlying model parameter is consistent. Consequently, our results can be employed to conduct counterfactual analysis after a preliminary step of identifying and estimating the underlying model parameter based on the existing literature. Our consistency results involve the development of a new general theory for Bayesian consistency of posterior distributions for mappings of sets. Although we primarily focus on a model of a strategic game, our approach is applicable to other structural models with similar features.</description>

      <title>Arellano-Bond LASSO Estimator for Dynamic Linear Panel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00584v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Arellano-Bond estimator is a fundamental method for dynamic panel data models, widely used in practice. However, the estimator is severely biased when the data's time series dimension $T$ is long due to the large degree of overidentification. We show that weak dependence along the panel's time series dimension naturally implies approximate sparsity of the most informative moment conditions, motivating the following approach to remove the bias: First, apply LASSO to the cross-section data at each time period to construct most informative (and cross-fitted) instruments, using lagged values of suitable covariates. This step relies on approximate sparsity to select the most informative instruments. Second, apply a linear instrumental variable estimator after first differencing the dynamic structural equation using the constructed instruments. Under weak time series dependence, we show the new estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under much weaker conditions on $T$'s growth than the Arellano-Bond estimator. Our theory covers models with high dimensional covariates, including multiple lags of the dependent variable, common in modern applications. We illustrate our approach by applying it to weekly county-level panel data from the United States to study opening K-12 schools and other mitigation policies' short and long-term effects on COVID-19's spread.</description>

      <title>Score-Driven Exponential Random Graphs: A New Class of Time-Varying Parameter Models for Dynamical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.10806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing abundance of data describing real-world networks that exhibit dynamical features, we propose an extension of the Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) that accommodates the time variation of its parameters. Inspired by the fast-growing literature on Dynamic Conditional Score models, each parameter evolves according to an updating rule driven by the score of the ERGM distribution. We demonstrate the flexibility of score-driven ERGMs (SD-ERGMs) as data-generating processes and filters and show the advantages of the dynamic version over the static one. We discuss two applications to temporal networks from financial and political systems. First, we consider the prediction of future links in the Italian interbank credit network. Second, we show that the SD-ERGM allows discriminating between static or time-varying parameters when used to model the U.S. Congress co-voting network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Overfitting Reduction in Convex Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex regression is a method for estimating the convex function from a data set. This method has played an important role in operations research, economics, machine learning, and many other areas. However, it has been empirically observed that convex regression produces inconsistent estimates of convex functions and extremely large subgradients near the boundary as the sample size increases. In this paper, we provide theoretical evidence of this overfitting behavior. To eliminate this behavior, we propose two new estimators by placing a bound on the subgradients of the convex function. We further show that our proposed estimators can reduce overfitting by proving that they converge to the underlying true convex function and that their subgradients converge to the gradient of the underlying function, both uniformly over the domain with probability one as the sample size is increasing to infinity. An application to Finnish electricity distribution firms confirms the superior performance of the proposed methods in predictive power over the existing methods.</description>
