      <title>Majorana edge states in s-wave kagome superconductors with Rashba interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study kagome lattices with on-site and extended spin-singlet s-wave superconducting pairing and show that the inclusion of Rashba spin-orbit (RSO) interaction allows time-reversal-invariant topological superconducting states which support helical Majorana pairs at the edge. We calculate the Z2 topological invariant as a function of the pairing parameters for different chemical potentials. The rich phase diagrams reveal topological, nodal, and trivial superconducting states depending on the system parameters. We also consider a 2X2 time-reversal symmetry-breaking chiral flux phase, which has been demonstrated to be energetically favorable in the AV3Sb5 family of superconductors. Incorporating such symmetry-breaking order in our model leads to chiral Majorana edge states defined by a Chern number. We show how the RSO interaction allows for topological phases with even and odd Chern numbers for different system parameters. This work demonstrates how a simple s-wave kagome superconductor with RSO interaction can support helical and chiral Majorana edge states, and motivates the search for Majorana fermions in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in tin telluride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of superconductivity and ferroelectricity hosts a wide range of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report on the observation of superconductivity in high-quality tin telluride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Unintentionally doped tin telluride undergoes a ferroelectric transition at ~100 K. The critical temperature of superconductivity increases monotonically with indium concentration. The critical field of superconductivity, however, does not follow the same behavior as critical temperature with indium concentration and exhibits a carrier-density-dependent violation of the Pauli limit. The electron-phonon coupling, from the McMillan formula, exhibits a systematic enhancement with indium concentration, suggesting a potential violation of BCS weak coupling at high indium concentrations.</description>

      <title>Rapid analysis of point-contact Andreev reflection spectra via machine learning with adaptive data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delineating the superconducting order parameters is a pivotal task in investigating superconductivity for probing pairing mechanisms, as well as their symmetry and topology. Point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) measurement is a simple yet powerful tool for identifying the order parameters. The PCAR spectra exhibit significant variations depending on the type of the order parameter in a superconductor, including its magnitude ($\mathit{\Delta}$), as well as temperature, interfacial quality, Fermi velocity mismatch, and other factors. The information on the order parameter can be obtained by finding the combination of these parameters, generating a theoretical spectrum that fits a measured experimental spectrum. However, due to the complexity of the spectra and the high dimensionality of parameters, extracting the fitting parameters is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to create models for rapid and automated analysis of PCAR spectra of various superconductors with different pairing symmetries (conventional $s$-wave, chiral $p_x+ip_y$-wave, and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave). The training datasets are generated based on the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory and further modified and augmented by selectively incorporating noise and peaks according to the bias voltages. This approach not only replicates the experimental spectra but also brings the model's attention to important features within the spectra. The optimized models provide fitting parameters for experimentally measured spectra in less than 100 ms per spectrum. Our approaches and findings pave the way for rapid and automated spectral analysis which will help accelerate research on superconductors with complex order parameters.</description>

      <title>Structure factors and quantum geometry in multiband BCS superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multiband BCS superconductors that exhibit time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing, and analyze their dynamic density and spin structure factors using linear-response theory within the mean-field BCS-BEC crossover framework at zero temperature. Our results for the multi-orbital Hubbard model satisfy the associated f-sum rules in several limits. In particular, in the strong-coupling limit, they coincide with those of a weakly-interacting Bose gas of Cooper pairs, where the low-energy collective Goldstone modes serve as Bogoliubov phonons. We further reveal that the quantum-geometric origin of the low-energy structure factors, along with related observables such as the superfluid-weight tensor and the effective-mass tensor of Cooper pairs, can be traced all the way back to the effective-mass theorem for Bloch bands in this limit. As an illustration, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that the Goldstone modes are the only relevant collective degrees of freedom in the flat-band regime.</description>

      <title>Non-linear vortex dynamics in the mixed state of superconducting a-MoGe and NbN thin films using low-frequency two-coil mutual inductance technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a two-coil mutual inductance technique to investigate the non-linear response of the vortex lattice of two type-II superconducting thin films, namely a very weakly pinned amorphous Molybdenum Germanium (a-MoGe) and a moderate-to-strongly pinned Niobium Nitride (NbN). We observe a strong dependence of the magnetic shielding response of the superconductors on the ac excitation amplitude in the primary coil of the two-coil setup. The sample response is studied through the evolution of the radial profile of the induced current density with increasing drive amplitude, which gets significantly modified by the effect of flux creep. We develop a computation scheme where we iteratively combine the coupled Maxwell-London equations for the geometry of the two coils and the sample involved, with a model developed by Coffey and Clem, to analyze the non-linear ac response. The central result of this analysis is that the effect of flux creep gives rise to a strong nonlinearity in the electrodynamic response in the vortex state of the superconducting thin films, that extends down to very low amplitudes of ac excitation. Our results also show that at subcritical low frequency ac drives, the vortex viscosity is exponentially larger than the Bardeen-Stephen estimate. We present a simple scheme to obtain the intrinsic value of the pinning force constant, which otherwise gets affected due to flux creep even at very low ac drives and point out some outstanding issues that need to be addressed in future theoretical and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium hysteretic phase transitions in periodically light-driven superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find nonequilibrium phase transitions accompanied by multiple (nested) hysteresis behaviors in superconductors coupled to baths under a time-periodic light driving.The transitions are demonstrated with a full phase diagram in the domain of the driving amplitude and frequency by means of the Floquet many-body theory. In the weak driving regime with a frequency smaller than half of the superconducting gap, excited quasiparticles are accumulated at the far edges of the bands, realizing a distribution reminiscent of the Eliashberg effect, which suddenly becomes unstable in the strong driving regime due to multi-photon-assisted tunneling across the gap mediated by the in-gap Floquet sidebands. We also show that superconductivity is enhanced in the weak driving regime without effective cooling, which is attributed to the modulation of the spectrum due to Floquet sidebands.</description>

      <title>Effects of Homogeneous Doping on Electron-Phonon Coupling in SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk n-type SrTiO3 (STO) has long been known to possess a superconducting ground state at an exceptionally dilute carrier density. This has raised questions about the applicability of the BCS-Eliashberg paradigm with its underlying adiabatic assumption. However, recent experimental reports have set the pairing gap to the critical temperature (Tc) ratio at the BCS value for superconductivity in Nb-doped STO, even though the adiabaticity condition the BCS pairing requires is satisfied over the entire superconducting dome only by the lowest branch of optical phonons. In spite of the strong implications these reports have on specifying the pairing glue, they have not proved sufficient in explaining the magnitude of the optimal doping. This motivated us to apply density functional theory to Nb-doped STO to analyze how the phonon band structures and the electron-phonon coupling evolve with doping. To describe the very low doping concentration, we tuned the homogeneous background charge, from which we obtained a first-principles result on the doping-dependent phonon frequency that is in good agreement with experimental data for Nb-doped STO. Using the EPW code, we obtain the doping-dependent phonon dispersion and the electron-phonon coupling strength. Within the framework of our calculation, we found that the electron-phonon coupling forms a dome in a doping range lower than the experimentally observed superconducting dome of the Nb-doped STO. Additionally, we examined the doping dependence of both the orbital angular momentum quenching in the electron-phonon coupling and the phonon displacement correlation length and found the former to have a strong correlation with our electron-phonon coupling in the overdoped region.</description>

      <title>Generalized Peierls substitution for Wannier obstructions: response to disorder and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum geometry, interactions, and external fields in complex band systems. When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals,this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</description>

      <title>Fusion Dynamics of Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinfull model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</description>

      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic low-temperature magnetic properties on the ultra-clean UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1 K revealed by $^{125}$Te NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate the intrinsic magnetic properties of UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR measurements on the ultra-clean single-crystalline UTe$_2$ with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1~K and compared the results with those of the $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6~K sample. The broadening of the linewidth of the NMR spectrum in the $a$-axis magnetic field and the low-temperature magnetic fluctuations observed in the 1.6~K sample are suppressed in the ultra-clean sample, indicating that such magnetic properties originate from a tiny amount of U deficiency. The present results suggest that the magnetic properties in UTe$_2$ are sensitive to the U deficiency. We also observed a peculiar angular dependence of the NMR quantities due to large magnetic anisotropy with the $a$-axis as the magnetic easy axis.</description>

      <title>Cooperation and competing of antipolar charge order and superconducting states in a quasi-2D superatomic metallic crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring various unexpected new quantum states and their corresponding extraordinary physics in low dimensional quantum materials, and investing them into application fields, is a primary concern of condensed matter physics. Previously, we performed joint experiments and theoretical calculations to investigate a superatomic crystal of Au6Te12Se8 with low symmetry, which stacks through non-covalent inter-cube quasi-bonds. Au6Te12Se8 exhibits a triple-cube charge density wave and spatially polarized metallic states interweaving at 9 K. In addition, it undergoes a BKT phase transition at 2.8 K to form a quasi-two-dimensional superconducting state. The subsequent high-pressure experimental results indicate that the two quantum states above compete with superconductivity. Here, we experimentally revealed competition and coexistence among superconductivity, triple-cube charge density waves, and polarized metallic states during further temperature-decreasing process, as examined using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, transport measurement, and Raman spectra. An extraordinary inversion symmetry broken emerged inside the triple-cube-period of the original CDW at 300 mK, leading to the polarized metallic states transforming into parallel polarization states. The evidence of spontaneous polarization coexisting with superconductivity in real space is extremely rare and has been revealed by STM. In addition, transport and Raman measurements indicate that there are multiple phase transition temperatures from 80K to that below the superconducting transition temperature of Au6Te12Se8, which may also contain more unknown exotic quantum states, providing a platform for further exploration of intriguing physical properties.</description>

      <title>Observation of edge and bulk states in a three-site Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A chain of quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems can form an artificial Kitaev chain hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs). These zero-energy states are expected to be localised on the edges of the chain, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. Here we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunneling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain.</description>
