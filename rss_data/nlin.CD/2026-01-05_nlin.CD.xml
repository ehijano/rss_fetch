      <title>Controlling synchronization dynamics via physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization control in networked dynamical systems requires regulating not only whether coherence is achieved, but also when and to what extent it emerges. We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for continuous-time synchronization regulation, in which system trajectories and control inputs are jointly parameterized and constrained by the governing dynamics. Macroscopic synchronization objectives are imposed directly at the trajectory level by enforcing persistence conditions on the order parameter after a prescribed target time. This formulation enables simultaneous control of synchronization time and coherence level without assuming any explicit feedback law or solving a strict optimal control problem. Numerical studies on networked Kuramoto oscillators demonstrate smooth synchronization with reduced transient control effort and competitive cumulative cost relative to analytical baselines. The framework remains effective in non-gradient and frustrated dynamics, highlighting physics-informed neural control as a flexible trajectory-level approach to synchronization regulation.</description>

      <title>A Topological Framework for Atmospheric River Interaction Using Framed Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are filamentary moisture pathways responsible for a large fraction of extreme precipitation and often occur as interacting filament bundles within the same synoptic regime. Existing diagnostics typically analyze ARs in isolation, despite the frequent coexistence and interaction of multiple filaments. We introduce a topological framework for AR analysis based on framed braids and framed braidoids, which encodes both the geometric interaction of AR centroids and the internal evolution of moisture transport.
  In this approach, AR filaments are represented as strands whose time-ordered crossings form braid words, while moisture-based framing captures internal intensification or weakening along each filament. Applying this framework to reanalysis-derived Atmospheric River track data, we construct braid and framed braid representations over sliding time windows and analyze a strongly interacting multi-filament AR episode in the North Pacific. The results show that braid-based indicators capture structural reorganizations and moisture intensification episodes that are not apparent from centroid geometry or IVT magnitude alone, offering a complementary structural perspective on atmospheric moisture transport.</description>

      <title>A new fast multiple-shooting method for computing periodic orbits in symplectic maps leveraging simultaneous Floquet vector computation to avoid large linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a 4D symplectic map $F_0$ that has a normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder foliated by invariant tori, those with rational rotation numbers are themselves foliated by subharmonic periodic orbits (SPOs). If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\varepsilon &gt;0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems. The tools have been successfully used for studies of resonant orbits in perturbed real-life celestial systems, the results of which are summarized as a demonstration of the methods' utility.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics and Stabilization of Zero-Mode Singularities in Multi-Scale Reaction-Diffusion Systems via Negative Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled System (MNCS), a dynamical model describing hierarchical state spaces with directed, sign-structured interactions. We address the stabilization of reaction-diffusion systems on bounded domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \le 3$) subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. A critical feature of this setting is the "zero-mode singularity," where the Laplacian operator possesses a trivial zero eigenvalue ($\lambda_0=0$), providing no linear dissipation for the spatial mean. We rigorously prove the global well-posedness of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}$ in the phase space $\mathbb{H}=(L^2(\Omega))^N$. Utilizing the Moser-Alikakos iteration technique, we establish uniform $L^\infty(\Omega)$ bounds, overcoming the lack of Sobolev embedding from $H^1$ into $L^\infty$ in three dimensions. These bounds enable the derivation of explicit upper estimates for the fractal dimension of the attractor via the Kaplan-Yorke trace formula. We show that the dimension scales as $d_F(\mathcal{A}) \sim \max\{0, \mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{A}}-\gamma\}^{d/2}$, confirming that the negative coupling strength $\gamma$ acts as a global regularizer that compresses the phase space. The theoretical results are validated using a stiff-stable Second-Order Exponential Time Differencing (ETD2) scheme with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to strictly enforce no-flux boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological Vibration Analysis of Elastic Lattices via Bloch Sphere Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical lattices support topological wave phenomena governed by geometric phases. We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional elastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of orthogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a Bloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry protection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes is piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps at symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that restoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the geometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing norm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere rotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A pi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a longitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates. These gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across wavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal stiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and sideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric phases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated regimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains robust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase data. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern dispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze and design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Averaging Theory for Multi-Timescale Driven Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a unitarity-preserving generalized Floquet framework for analytically modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.</description>
