      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of VQC for Financial Fraud Detection: A Comparative Study of Quantum Encoding Techniques and Architectural Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic comparative analysis of Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) configurations for financial fraud detection, encompassing three distinct quantum encoding techniques and comprehensive architectural variations. Through empirical evaluation across multiple entanglement patterns, circuit depths, and optimization strategies,quantum advantages in fraud classification accuracy are demonstrated, achieving up to 94.3 % accuracy with ZZ encoding schemes. The analysis reveals significant performance variations across entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently outperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns, achieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel visualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides actionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning implementations. Notably, systematic entanglement pattern analysis shows that circular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and trainability while maintaining computational efficiency. These researches offer initial benchmarks for quantum enhanced fraud detection systems and propose potential benefits of quantum machine learning in financial security applications.</description>

      <title>Error detection without post-selection in adaptive quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum computers are limited by errors, but have not yet achieved the scale required to benefit from active error correction in large computations. We show how simulations of open quantum systems can benefit from error detection. In particular, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to perform logical simulations of a non-equilibrium phase transition using the [[4,2,2]] code. Importantly, by converting detected errors into random resets, which are an intended part of the dissipative quantum dynamics being studied, we avoid any post-selection in our simulations, thereby eliminating the exponential cost typically associated with error detection. The encoded simulations perform near break-even with unencoded simulations at short times.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As illustrated by Wigner, all symmetries forming a group structure (and hence invertible) must be either unitary or antiunitary. Relinquishing this assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Krylov Winding and Emergent Coherence in Operator Growth Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operator wavefunction provides a fine-grained description of quantum chaos and of the irreversible growth of simple operators into increasingly complex ones. Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a phase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called $\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a holographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator remains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body system. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related concept of $\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a phase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding is a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding under two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and size bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and (ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\lambda_L \leq 2 \alpha$ (with $\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\alpha$ the growth rate), which ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not saturate this bound, with $h = \lambda_L / 2\alpha &lt;1$, the winding with Pauli size $\ell$ becomes $\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\ell^{1/h}$. We illustrate these results with two microscopic models: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and a disordered $k$-local spin model.</description>

      <title>Quantum process tomography of a compressed time evolution circuit on superconducting quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As present day quantum hardware is limited by various noise mechanisms, quantum advantage can only be reached in the near-term by designing noise-resilient quantum algorithms. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to characterize the noise channels of IBM quantum processors under realistic runtime constraints. As our main application, we compare the Trotter time-evolution of three- and four-qubit wave functions to a compressed quantum circuit version of the same evolution operator. By analysing the spectral properties of the two process channels, we find that the compressed circuit systematically yields larger eigenvalue moduli, demonstrating better noise resilience.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum computation with all-to-all Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-to-all interactions arise naturally in many areas of theoretical physics and across diverse experimental quantum platforms, motivating a systematic study of their information-processing power. Assuming each pair of qubits interacts with $\mathrm{O}(1)$ strength, time-dependent all-to-all Hamiltonians can simulate arbitrary all-to-all quantum circuits, performing quantum computation in time proportional to the circuit depth. We show that this naive correspondence is far from optimal: all-to-all Hamiltonians can process information on much shorter timescales.
  First, we prove that any two-qubit gate can be simulated by all-to-all Hamiltonians on $N$ qubits in time $\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ (up to factor $N^{\delta}$ with an arbitrarily small constant $\delta&gt;0$), with polynomially small error $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$. Immediate consequences include: 1) Certain $\mathrm{O}(N)$-qubit unitaries and entangled states, such as the multiply-controlled Toffoli gate and the GHZ and W states, can be generated in $\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ time; 2) Trading space for time, any quantum circuit can be simulated in arbitrarily short time; 3) Information could propagate in a fast way that saturates known Lieb-Robinson bounds in strongly power-law interacting systems.
  Our second main result proves that any depth-$D$ quantum circuit can be simulated by a randomized Hamiltonian protocol in time $T=\mathrm{O}(D/\sqrt{N})$, with constant space overhead and polynomially small error.
  The techniques underlying our results depart fundamentally from the existing literature on parallelizing commuting gates: We rely crucially on non-commuting Hamiltonians and draw on diverse physical ideas.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Scaling in a Continuous-Wave Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-wave (CW) interferometry has stood at the frontier of precision measurement science since its inception, where it was used to search for the luminiferous ether, to the present day, where it forms the basis of interferometric gravitational-wave detection. Quantum theory predicts that this frontier can be expanded more rapidly by employing certain quantum resources, compared with the case of using only classical resources. In the quantum case, we can achieve ``Heisenberg scaling'', which manifests as a quadratic improvement over the best possible classical precision scaling. Although Heisenberg scaling has been demonstrated in pulsed operation, it has not been demonstrated for continuous operation. The challenge in doing so is two-fold: continuous measurements capable of Heisenberg scaling were previously unknown, and the requisite CW quantum states are fragile. Here we overcome these challenges and demonstrate the first CW interferometer exhibiting resource efficiency approaching Heisenberg scaling. Our scheme comprises a Mach-Zehnder interferometer illuminated with a pair of squeezed light sources, followed by a nonlinear estimator of the output homodyne record to estimate a differential phase modulation signal that drives the interferometer. We observe that this signal can be extracted with a precision that scales faster than what is allowed classically, and approaches the Heisenberg scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement via the Barnett effect in a spinning ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of boson sampling as a hardware accelerator for monte carlo integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of boson sampling as a hardware accelerator for Monte Carlo integration. Our approach leverages importance sampling to factorize an integrand into a distribution that can be sampled using quantum hardware and a function that can be evaluated classically, enabling hybrid quantum-classical computation. We argue that for certain classes of integrals, this method offers a quantum advantage by efficiently sampling from probability distributions that are hard to simulate classically. We also identify structural criteria that must be satisfied to preserve computational hardness, notably the sensitivity of the classical post-processing function to high-order quantum correlations. To validate our protocol, we implement a proof-of-principle experiment on a programmable photonic platform to compute the first-order energy correction of a three-boson system in a harmonic trap under an Efimov-inspired three-body perturbation. The experimental results are consistent with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations, with deviations explained by photon distinguishability, discretization, and unitary imperfections. Additionally, we provide an error budget quantifying the impact of these same sources of noise. Our work establishes a concrete use case for near-term photonic quantum devices and highlights a viable path toward practical quantum advantage in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Bosonic Systems at Thermal Equilibrium: Computational Complexity and Clustering of Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range systems, characterized by couplings that decay as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$, are of fundamental importance and attract widespread interest across diverse physical phenomena. Among these, bosonic systems are particularly significant due to their theoretical importance and experimental relevance. In this Letter, we propose a classical algorithm with a quasipolynomial runtime to efficiently approximate the partition function of long-range bosonic systems at high temperatures. For finite-range systems, the complexity improves to almost polynomial time. We also present a rigorous proof for the power-law decay of correlation functions. This property, known as clustering of correlation, is well-established for finite-range spin models. However, in sharp contrast, has remained largely unexplored for long-range bosonic systems. The results presented here address two long-standing gaps concerning the computational complexity and correlation clustering in such systems. The methodology we introduce provides new tools for future studies of challenging problems in statistical and quantum many-body physics concerning bosonic system and computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walking oil droplets offer a qualitative, classical analog of single-particle diffraction. Making this analog quantitative has proven challenging, leading recent authors to conjecture that no classical pilot-wave model could exhibit Fraunhofer diffraction. We revisit the problem with the recent, Lagrangian pilot-wave model of Darrow and Bush [Symmetry 16, 149 (2024)], and find agreement with both single- and double-slit Fraunhofer patterns. We identify two distinct dynamical features that enable our model to capture Fraunhofer diffraction and distinguish it from previous classical pilot-wave models.</description>

      <title>Quantum heuristics for linear optimization over large separable operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing over separable quantum objects is challenging for two key reasons: determining separability is NP-hard, and the dimensionality of the problem grows exponentially with the number of qubits. We address both challenges by introducing a heuristic algorithm that leverages a quantum co-processor to significantly reduce the problem's dimensionality. We then numerically demonstrate that see-saw-type optimization performs well in lower-dimensional settings. A notable feature of our approach is that it yields feasible solutions, not just bounds on the optimal value, in contrast to many outer-approximation-based methods. We apply our method to the problem of finding separable states with minimal energy for a given Hamiltonian and use this to define an entanglement measure for its ground space. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can approximate the separable ground energy of Hamiltonians up to 28 qubits.</description>

      <title>Encoder Circuit Optimization for Non-Binary Quantum Error Correction Codes in Prime Dimensions: An Algorithmic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are a revolutionary class of computational platforms with applications in combinatorial and global optimization, machine learning, and other domains involving computationally hard problems. While these machines typically operate on qubits, which are quantum information elements that can occupy superpositions of the basis states 0 and 1, recent advances have demonstrated the practical implementation of higher-dimensional quantum systems (qudits) across various hardware platforms. In these hardware realizations, the higher-order states are less stable and thus remain coherent for a shorter duration than the basis 0 and 1 states. Moreover, formal methods for designing efficient encoder circuits for these systems remain underexplored. This limitation motivates the development of efficient circuit techniques for qudit systems (d-level quantum systems). Previous works have typically established generating gate sets for higher-dimensional codes by generalizing the methods used for qubits. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework for optimizing encoder circuits for prime-dimension stabilizer codes. This framework is based on novel generating gate sets whose elements map directly to efficient Clifford gate sequences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on key codes, achieving a 13-44 percent reduction in encoder circuit gate count for the qutrit (d = 3) codes [[9,5,3]], [[5,1,3]], and [[7,1,3]], and a 9-21 percent reduction for the ququint (d = 5) code [[10,6,3]] when compared to prior work. We also achieved circuit depth reductions up to 42 percent.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple algorithm that implements an arbitrary $n$-qubit unitary operator using a Clifford+T circuit with T-count $O(2^{4n/3} n^{2/3})$. This improves upon the previous best known upper bound of $O(2^{3n/2} n)$, while the best known lower bound remains $\Omega(2^n)$. Our construction is based on a recursive application of the cosine-sine decomposition, together with a generalization of the optimal diagonal unitary synthesis method by Gosset, Kothari, and Wu to multi-controlled $k$-qubit unitaries.</description>

Abstract: The Lamb shift as an additional energy correction induced by environments usually has a marginal contribution and hence is neglected. We demonstrate that the Lamb shift, which modifies the energy levels, can influence the heat current to varying extents. We focus on the steady-state heat current through two coupled two-level atoms, respectively, in contact with a heat reservoir at a certain temperature. We find that the Lamb shift suppresses the steady-state heat current at small temperature gradients, while at large gradients, the heat current is restricted by an upper bound without the Lamb shift but diverges when it is included. These results not only demonstrate the Lamb shift's critical role in quantum heat transport but also advance our understanding of its impact in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Neural Networks Backflow for Strongly Correlated Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for strongly correlated systems remains one of the grand challenges in quantum chemistry. Here we demonstrate that Transformer architectures can be adapted to capture the complex grammar of electronic correlations through neural network backflow. In this approach, electronic configurations are processed as token sequences, where attention layers learn non-local orbital correlations and token-specific neural networks map these contextual representations into backflowed orbitals. Application to strongly correlated iron-sulfur clusters validates our approach: for $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{~S}_2\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([2Fe-2S]) (30e,20o), the ground-state energy within chemical accuracy of DMRG while predicting magnetic exchange coupling constants closer to experimental values than all compared methods including DMRG, CCSD(T), and recent neural network approaches. For $\left[\mathrm{Fe}_4 \mathrm{S}_4\left(\mathrm{SCH}_3\right)_4\right]^{2-}$ ([4Fe-4S]) (54e,36o), we match DMRG energies and accurately reproduce detailed spin-spin correlation patterns between all Fe centers. The approach scales favorably to large active spaces inaccessible to exact methods, with distributed VMC optimization enabling stable convergence. These results establish Transformer-based backflow as a powerful variational ansatz for strongly correlated electronic structure, achieving superior magnetic property predictions while maintaining chemical accuracy in total energies.</description>

      <title>Ingress Cryogenic Receivers Toward Scalable Quantum Information Processing: Theory and System Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current control techniques for cryogenically cooled qubits are realized with coaxial cables, posing multiple challenges in terms of cost, thermal load, size, and long-term scalability. Emerging approaches to tackle this issue include cryogenic CMOS electronics at 4 K, and photonic links for direct qubit control. In this paper, we propose a multiplexed all-passive cryogenic high frequency direct detection control platform (cryo-HFDD). The proposed classical interface for direct qubit control utilizes optical or sub-THz bands. We present the possible tradeoffs of this platform, and compare it with current state-of-the-art cryogenic CMOS and conventional coaxial approaches. We assess the feasibility of adopting these efficient links for a wide range of microwave qubit power levels. Specifically, we estimate the heat load to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio SNR considering different noise sources, component losses, as well as link density. We show that multiplexed photonic receivers at 4 K can aggressively scale the control of thousands of qubits. This opens the door for low cost scalable quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness without Magic: Classically Simulatable Quantum States That Are Indistinguishable by Classically Simulatable Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state discrimination plays a central role in defining the possible and impossible operations through a restricted class of quantum operations. A seminal result by Bennett et al. [Phys. Rev. A 59, 1070 (1999)] demonstrates the existence of a set of mutually orthogonal separable quantum states that cannot be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication, a phenomenon known as nonlocality without entanglement. We show that a parallel structure exists in the resource theory of magic: there exists a set of mutually orthogonal stabilizer states that cannot be perfectly distinguished by stabilizer operations, which consist of Clifford gates, measurements in the computational basis, and additional ancillary stabilizer states. This phenomenon, which we term 'nonstabilizerness without magic,' reveals a fundamental asymmetry between the preparation of classically efficiently simulatable stabilizer states and their discrimination, which cannot be performed by classically efficiently simulatable quantum circuits. We further discuss the implications of our findings for quantum data hiding, the no-cloning of stabilizer states, and unconditional verification of non-Clifford gates.</description>

      <title>Physically-Motivated Guiding States for Local Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work characterises families of guiding states for the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem, revealing new connections between physical constraints and computational complexity. Focusing on states motivated by Quantum Chemistry and Hamiltonian Complexity, we extend prior BQP-hardness results beyond semi-classical subset states. We demonstrate that broader state families preserve hardness, while maintaining classical tractability under practical parameter regimes. Crucially, we provide a constructive proof of BQP containment for the canonical problem, showing the problem is BQP-complete when provided with a polynomial-size classical description of the guiding state. Our results show quantum advantage persists for physically meaningful state classes, and classical methods remain viable when guiding states admit appropriate descriptions. We identify a Goldilocks zone of guiding states that are efficiently preparable, succinctly described, and sample-query accessible, allowing for a meaningful comparison between quantum and classical approaches. Our work furthers the complexity landscape for ground state estimation problems, presenting steps toward experimentally relevant settings while clarifying the boundaries of quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of the Local Hamiltonian problem under the promise that its ground state is succinctly represented. We show that the Succinct State 3-Local Hamiltonian problem is (promise) MA-complete. Our proof proceeds by systematically characterising succinct quantum states and modifying the original MA-hardness reduction. In particular, we show that a broader class of succinct states suffices to capture the hardness of the problem, extending and strengthening prior results to classes of Hamiltonians with lower locality.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Detection of Topological Phase Transitions with a Quantum Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, characterizing topological phase transitions typically requires complex many-body topological invariants, which are costly to compute and measure. Inspired by quantum reservoir computing, we propose an unsupervised quantum phase detection method based on a many-body localized evolution, enabling efficient identification of phase transitions in the extended SSH model. The evolved quantum states produce feature distributions under local measurements, which, after simple post-processing and dimensionality reduction, naturally cluster according to different Hamiltonian parameters. Numerical simulations show that the evolution combined with local measurements can significantly amplify distinctions between quantum states, providing an efficient means to detect topological phase transitions. Our approach requires neither complex measurements nor full density matrix reconstruction, making it practical and feasible for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem for Stoquastic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem for stoquastic Hamiltonians is (promise) BPP-hard. The Guided Local Hamiltonian problem is a variant of the Local Hamiltonian problem that incorporates an additional input known as a guiding state, which is promised to overlap with the ground state. For a range of local Hamiltonian families, this problem is (promise) BQP-hard, though for stoquastic Hamiltonians, the complexity was previously unknown. Our results are achieved by first reducing from quantum-inspired BPP circuits to 6-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. We prove particular classes of quantum states, known as semi-classical encoded subset states, can guide the estimation of the ground state energy. Subsequent analysis shows the BPP-hardness is not dependent on the locality, i.e., the result holds for 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonians. Additional arguments further the BPP-hardness to Hamiltonians restricted to a square lattice. We also find for stoquastic Hamiltonians with a fixed local constraint on a subset of the system qubits, the Guided Local Hamiltonian problem is BQP-hard.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Acoustic Control of Resonance Fluorescence from a Strongly Driven Two-Level System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonance fluorescence from a single two-level system is a cornerstone of quantum optics. In the strong driving regime, its emission spectrum exhibits the iconic Mollow triplet, with each spectral component corresponding to a transition between distinct atom-photon dressed states. Here, we experimentally study the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a novel driving configuration in which a second gigahertz-frequency field drives the Rabi transition between two atom-photon dressed states. Our experiment is performed on a single semiconductor quantum dot strongly driven by a laser and a surface acoustic wave. We observe emission spectra that are significantly altered from the standard Mollow triplet, including the dynamical cancellation of resonance fluorescence at the central emission frequency. These spectra are explained by a theoretical model that incorporates the hybridization of the two-level system, the optical field, and the acoustic field. Motivated by this model, we experimentally validate the condition for optimal cooling of acoustic phonons in an emitter-optomechanical system. Our results offer new insights into the quantum interactions among single two-level systems, optical fields, and acoustic fields in the strong driving limit, with important applications in nonclassical acoustic state generation, quantum transduction, and quantum sensing of thermal motions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the state-restoring protocol based on the controlled interaction of a linear chain with environment through the specially adjusted step-wise time dependent Lindblad operators. We show that the best restoring result (maximal scale factors in the restored state) corresponds to the symmetrical Lindblad equation. (0,1)-excitation dynamics is considered numerically, and restoring protocol for the 1-order coherence matrix is proposed for the case of the two-qubit sender (receiver). The state-restoring with equal scale factors is also considered reflecting the uniform scaling of the restored information.</description>

      <title>Probeless vs Probe-Based Variable-Strength Eavesdropping in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a provably secure way of generating a secret key, which can later be used for encoding and decoding information. In this paper we analyze the effects of an eavesdropper's variable-strength measurements on QKD. Two types of measurements have been considered: (i) a probe-based model, commonly referred to as a "weak measurement", in which each qubit is weakly coupled to a continuous variable probe which is later projectively measured (ii) a probeless model, usually referred to as a "partial measurement", where only a small (tunable) part of all transmitted photons is projectively measured and the rest are transmitted with no disturbance. The information gain of the eavesdropper and the quantum-bit-error-rate (QBER) are computed for each case. An experimental realization of an intercept-and-resend attack based on variable-strength partial measurements is demonstrated in a time-bin-encoded, fiber-based simplified Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol, which is compatible with data centers. It is shown that the measured information gain and QBER follow the theoretical curves across the full coupling range, validating the partial-measurement model and clarifying its relation to the well-known monitoring channel. Further attacks involving photon number splitting and noise injection during the calibration stage are also analyzed. The results highlight the theoretical differences between weak and partial measurements, while also demonstrating the practicality of probeless eavesdropping in the case of real-world QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantum-Enabled Biomarker Discovery: An Outlook from Q4Bio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a case study and forward-looking perspective on co-design for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, centered on the goal of empirical quantum advantage (EQA), which we define as a measurable performance gain using quantum hardware over state-of-the-art classical methods on the same task. Because classical algorithms continue to improve, the EQA crossover point is a moving target; nevertheless, we argue that a persistent advantage is possible for our application class even if the crossover point shifts. Specifically, our team examines the task of biomarker discovery in precision oncology. We push the limitations of the best classical algorithms, improving them as best as we can, and then augment them with a quantum subroutine for the task where we are most likely to see performance gains. We discuss the implementation of a quantum subroutine for feature selection on current devices, where hardware constraints necessitate further co-design between algorithm and physical device capabilities. Looking ahead, we perform resource analysis to explore a plausible EQA region on near/intermediate-term hardware, considering the impacts of advances in classical and quantum computing on this regime. Finally, we outline potential clinical impact and broader applications of this hybrid pipeline beyond oncology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyze three feature map representations of parametrized quantum dynamics, which generalize variational quantum circuits. These are (i) a Lie-Fourier partial sum, (ii) a Taylor expansion, and (iii) a finite-dimensional sinc kernel regression representation. The Lie-Fourier representation is shown to have a dense spectrum with discrete peaks, that reflects control Hamiltonian properties, but that is also compressible in typically found symmetric systems. We prove boundedness in the spectrum and the cost function derivatives, and discrete symmetries of the coefficients, with implications for learning and simulation. We further show the landscape is Lipschitz continuous, linking global variation bounds to local Taylor approximation error - key for step size selection, convergence estimates, and stopping criteria in optimization. This also provides a new form of polynomial barren plateaux originating from the Lie-Fourier structure of the quantum dynamics. These results may find application in local and general surrogate model learning, which we benchmark numerically, in characterizations of hardness and phase transitions in the problem instances, and for meta-parameter heuristics in quantum optimizers.</description>

      <title>Computable measures of non-Markovianity for Gaussian free fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate measures of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems governed by Gaussian free fermionic dynamics. Standard indicators of non-Markovian behavior, such as the BLP and LFS measures, are revisited in this context. We show that for Gaussian states, trace-based distances -- specifically the Hilbert-Schmidt norm -- and second-order R\'enyi mutual information can be efficiently expressed in terms of two-point correlation functions, enabling practical computation even in systems where the full density matrix is intractable. Crucially, this framework remains valid even when the density matrix of the system is an average over stochastic Gaussian trajectories, yielding a non-Gaussian state. We present efficient numerical protocols based on this structure and demonstrate their feasibility through a small-scale simulation. Our approach opens a scalable path to quantifying non-Markovianity in interacting or measured fermionic systems, with applications in quantum information and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition induced by magnon Kerr effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, proposals for realizing a nonreciprocal superradiant quantum phase transition (SQPT) have been put forward, based on either nonreciprocal interactions between two spin ensembles or the Sagnac-Fizeau shift in a spinning cavity. However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal SQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable of producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to realize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a cavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are coupled to cavity photons. The Kerr coefficient $K$ is positive (negative), i.e., $K&gt;0$ ($K&lt;0$), when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the crystallographic axis [100] ([110]) of the YIG sphere. We show that the steady-state phase diagrams differ significantly for both cases with $K &gt; 0$ and $K &lt; 0$, which is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying the steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric drive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal, characterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K &gt; 0$ and $K &lt; 0$. Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this nonreciprocal behavior. Our work provides a new mechanism for realizing the nonreciprocal SQPT, with potential applications in designing nonreciprocal quantum devices.</description>

      <title>MUSS-TI: Multi-level Shuttle Scheduling for Large-Scale Entanglement Module Linked Trapped-Ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion computing is a leading architecture in the pursuit of scalable and high fidelity quantum systems. Modular quantum architectures based on photonic interconnects offer a promising path for scaling trapped ion devices. In this design, multiple Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) units are interconnected through entanglement module. Each unit features a multi-zone layout that separates functionalities into distinct areas, enabling more efficient and flexible quantum operations. However, achieving efficient and scalable compilation of quantum circuits in such entanglement module linked Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (EML-QCCD) remains a primary challenge for practical quantum applications.
  In this work, we propose a scalable compiler tailored for large-scale trapped-ion architectures, with the goal of reducing the shuttling overhead inherent in EML-QCCD devices. MUSS-TI introduces a multi-level scheduling approach inspired by multi-level memory scheduling in classical computing. This method is designed to be aware of the distinct roles of different zones and to minimize the number of shuttling operations required in EML-QCCD systems. We demonstrate that EML-QCCD architectures are well-suited for executing large-scale applications. Our evaluation shows that MUSS-TI reduces shuttle operations by 41.74% for applications with 30-32 qubits, and by an average of 73.38% and 59.82% for applications with 117-128 qubits and 256-299 qubits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Practical security of local local oscillator continuous-variable quantum key distribution systems with pulse width mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems, using a local local oscillator (LLO) scheme removes the local oscillator side channel, enhances Bob's detection performance and reduces the excess noise caused by photon leakage, thereby effectively improves the system's security and performance. However, in this scheme, since the signal and the LO are generated by different lasers and the signal propagates through the untrusted quantum channel, their pulse widths may become mismatched. Such mismatches may reduce the precision of detection at Bob, affecting parameter estimation processes and leading to inaccurate calculations of the secret key rate. Moreover, mismatches may introduce potential security loopholes. Thus, this paper investigates the practical security issues of the LLO-CVQKD system when pulse width mismatch occurs between the local oscillator and the signal. We first model the case of pulse width mismatch and analyze its impact on Bob's detection. Then, we simulate the secret key rate under different mismatch levels. Based on the analysis, we find that under such mismatch, the key parameters involved in secret key rate calculation are incorrectly estimated, leading to an overestimation of the system's secret key rate. Therefore, this imperfect mismatch can open a loophole for Eve to perform attacks in practical systems. To close this loophole, we design a scheme at Bob to monitor the pulse widths of both the signal and the local oscillator, and to reshape the waveform of the local oscillator so that the two lights are matched again. This method eliminates the adverse effects caused by pulse width mismatch and effectively resists Eve's attacks which exploit this loophole.</description>

      <title>Gradiometric, Fully Tunable C-Shunted Flux Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully tunable flux qubits offer in-situ and independent controls of their energy potential asymmetry and tunnel barrier, making them versatile tools for quantum computation and the study of decoherence sources. However, only short coherence times have been demonstrated so far with this type of qubit. Here, we present a capacitively shunted flux qubit featuring improved relaxation times up to T1 = 25 $\mu$s and a frequency tunability range of $\sim$ 20 GHz at the flux-insensitive sweet spot. As a model application, we demonstrate detection of two-level tunneling defects in a frequency range spanning one octave.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Receiver via Scalable Rydberg Vapor Cell Array with Stark Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms have great potential for microwave (MW) measurements due to their high sensitivity, broad carrier bandwidth, and traceability. However, the narrow instantaneous bandwidth of the MW receiver limits its applications. Improving the instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver is an ongoing challenge. Here, we report on the achievement of an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth MW receiver via a linear array of scalable Rydberg vapor cells with Stark comb, where the Stark comb consists of an MW frequency comb (MFC) and a position-dependent Stark field. In the presence of the Stark field, the resonance MW transition frequency between two Rydberg states is position dependent, so that we can make each MFC line act as a local oscillator (LO) field to resonantly couple one Rydberg cell. Thus, each cell receives part of a broadband MW signal within its instantaneous bandwidth using atomic heterodyne detection, achieving the measurements of the broadband MW signal simultaneously. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the MW receiver with 210~MHz instantaneous bandwidth using an MFC field with 21 lines. Meanwhile, we achieve an overall sensitivity of 326.6~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. In principle, the method allows for achieving an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver, provided we have enough MFC lines with enough power. Our work paves the way to design and develop a scalable MW receiver for applications in radar, communication, and spectrum monitoring.</description>

      <title>Autonomous quantum error correction beyond break-even and its metrological application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to extend the lifetime of a logical qubit beyond that of the best physical qubit available within the same system, i.e., the break-even point, is a prerequisite for building practical quantum computers. So far, this point has been exceeded through active quantum error correction (QEC) protocols, where a logical error is corrected by measuring its syndrome and then performing an adaptive correcting operation. Autonomous QEC (AQEC), without the need for such resource-consuming measurement-feedback control, has been demonstrated in several experiments, but none of which has unambiguously reached the break-even point. Here, we present an unambiguous demonstration of beyond-break-even AQEC in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system, where a photonic logical qubit encoded in a superconducting microwave cavity is protected against photon loss through autonomous error correction, enabled by engineered dissipation. Under the AQEC protection, the logical qubit achieves a lifetime surpassing that of the best physical qubit available in the system by 18\%. We further employ this AQEC protocol to enhance the precision for measuring a slight frequency shift, achieving a metrological gain of 6.3 dB over that using the most robust Fock-state superposition. These results illustrate that the demonstrated AQEC procedure not only represents a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computation but also offers advantages for building robust quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>AiDE-Q: Synthetic Labeled Datasets Can Enhance Learning Models for Quantum Property Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body problems are central to various scientific disciplines, yet their ground-state properties are intrinsically challenging to estimate. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) offer potential solutions in this field, complementing prior purely classical and quantum approaches. However, existing DL-based models typically assume access to a large-scale and noiseless labeled dataset collected by infinite sampling. This idealization raises fundamental concerns about their practical utility, especially given the limited availability of quantum hardware in the near term. To unleash the power of these DL-based models, we propose AiDE-Q (\underline{a}utomat\underline{i}c \underline{d}ata \underline{e}ngine for \underline{q}uantum property estimation), an effective framework that addresses this challenge by iteratively generating high-quality synthetic labeled datasets. Specifically, AiDE-Q utilizes a consistency-check method to assess the quality of synthetic labels and continuously improves the employed DL models with the identified high-quality synthetic dataset. To verify the effectiveness of AiDE-Q, we conduct extensive numerical simulations on a diverse set of quantum many-body and molecular systems, with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AiDE-Q enhances prediction performance for various reference learning models, with improvements of up to $14.2\%$. Moreover, we exhibit that a basic supervised learning model integrated with AiDE-Q outperforms advanced reference models, highlighting the importance of a synthetic dataset. Our work paves the way for more efficient and practical applications of DL for quantum property estimation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Majorana zero modes across hybrid Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev chain has been extensively explored in the context of uniform couplings, with studies focusing either on purely nearest-neighbor interactions or on systems dominated by long-range superconducting pairing. Building on these investigations, we introduce a hybrid Kitaev chain in which the lattice is partitioned into two segments: the left segment comprises nearest-neighbor couplings, while the right segment incorporates long-range pairing. To probe the role of the interface, we study two scenarios: a decoupled (suppressed hopping) case, where the segments are isolated, and a coupled case, where they are connected via interface hopping that enables coherent tunneling. Using this setup, we investigate the behavior of Majorana zero modes at the interface between the two segments, finding that in the decoupled case, Majorana zero modes remain sharply localized at the left segment chain edges while massive Dirac modes remain in right segment chain edges, with their energies and localization strongly dependent on the long-range pairing exponent. Introducing a finite interface coupling enables coherent transfer of Majorana zero modes from the edges of the left segment to those of the right segment of the chain. We characterize this dynamics by the fidelity of state transfer, dynamical rotation, and inverse participation ratio. We show the signature of MZM transfer across the interface by the spatiotemporal profile of the probability distribution of the time evolved state.</description>

      <title>Progress in the study of the (non)existence of genuinely unextendible product bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the open problem of the existence of genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPBs), that is, multipartite unextendible product bases (UPBs) which remain unextendible even with respect to biproduct vectors across all bipartitions of the parties. To this end, we exploit the well-known connection between UPBs and graph theory through orthogonality graphs and orthogonal representations, together with recent progress in this framework, and employ forbidden induced subgraph characterizations to single out the admissible local orthogonality graphs for GUPBs. Using this approach, we establish that GUPBs of size thirteen in three-qutrit systems-the smallest candidate GUPBs-do not exist. We further provide a partial characterization of graphs relevant to larger bases and systems with ququart subsystems.</description>

      <title>Enabling full localization of qubits and gates with a multi-mode coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable couplers are a key building block of superconducting quantum processors, enabling high on-off ratios for two-qubit entangling interactions. While crosstalk can be mitigated in idle mode, conventional single-mode couplers lack independent control over interactions in the one- and two-excitation manifolds, leading to unitary errors such as leakage during gate operations. Moreover, even at the nominal decoupled point, residual wavefunction delocalization persists, causing unintended qubit-qubit coupling. Here we propose a multi-mode tunable coupler that enables nonlinear control of interactions across excitation manifolds, achieving a high on-off ratio in the one-excitation manifold while suppressing coupling in the two-excitation manifold. The proposed design also realizes complete localization between qubits, providing perfect isolation at the decoupled point and opening new possibilities for scalable, high-fidelity quantum gates.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimisation of Traveling Salesperson Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a quintessential NP-hard combinatorial optimisation challenge, is vital for logistics and network design but limited by exponential complexity in large instances. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework integrating variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) optimisation with classical machine learning, using K-means clustering for problem decomposition and a RandomForestRegressor for path refinement. Evaluated on 80 European cities (from 4 to 80 cities, 38,500 samples in total) via Qiskit's AerSimulator and ibm_kyiv 127-qubit backend, the hybrid approach outperforms quantum-only methods, achieving an approximation ratio of 1.0287 at 80 cities, a 47.5% improvement over quantum-only's 1.9614, nearing the classical baseline. Machine learning reduces variability in tour distances (interquartile range, IQR - the spread of the middle 50% of results relative to the median - from 0.06 to 0.04), enhancing stability despite noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) noise. This framework underscores hybrid strategies' potential for scalable TSP optimisation, with future hardware advancements promising practical quantum advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of symmetric quantum walks on Hamming graphs, where the distance between vertices specifies the transition probability. A special model is the simple quantum walk on the hypercube, which has been discussed in the literature. Eigenvalues of the unitary operator of the quantum walks are zeros of certain self-reciprocal polynomials. We obtain a spectral representation of the wave vector, where our systematic treatment relies on the coin space isomorphic to the state space and the commutative association scheme. The limit distributions of several quantum walks are obtained.</description>

      <title>Suppressing leakage and maintaining robustness in transmon qubits: Signatures of a trade-off relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimally generating quantum gates in a logical subspace embedded in a larger Hilbert space, where the dynamics is also affected by unknown static imperfections. This general problem is widespread across various emergent quantum technology architectures. We derive the fidelity susceptibility in the computational subspace as a measure of robustness to perturbations, and define a cost function that quantifies leakage out of the subspace. We tackle both effects using a two-stage optimization where two cost functions are minimized in series. Specifically, we apply this framework to the generation of single-qubit gates in a superconducting transmon system, and find high-fidelity solutions robust to detuning and amplitude errors across various parameter regimes. We also show control pulses which maximize fidelity while minimizing leakage at all times during the evolution. However, finding control solutions that address both effects simultaneously is shown to be much more challenging, indicating the presence of a trade-off relation.</description>

      <title>Photonic Simulation of Beyond-Quantum Nonlocal Correlations (e.g. Popescu-Rohrlich Box) with Non-Signaling Quantum Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality exemplifies the most profound departure of quantum theory from classical realism. Yet, the extent of nonlocality in quantum theory is intrinsically bounded, falling short of the correlations permitted by the relativistic causality (the no-signaling) principle. A paradigmatic example is the Popescu-Rohrlich correlation: two distant parties sharing arbitrary entanglement cannot achieve this correlation, though it can be simulated with classical communication between them. Here we show how such post-quantum correlations can instead be simulated using intrinsically non-signaling physical resources, and implement the proposed scheme using a quantum circuit on a four-qubit photonic platform. Unlike the conventional approaches, our method exploits dynamical correlations between distinct physical systems, with intrinsic randomness suppressing any signaling capacity. This enables the realization of post-quantum correlations both with and without entanglement. We also analyze how the simulation scheme extends to beyond quantum nonlocal correlations in multipartite systems. Our experimental demonstration using a photonic system establishes a versatile framework for exploring post-quantum correlations in both foundational settings and as a resource for computation and security applications.</description>

      <title>Strong random unitaries and fast scrambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how fast physical systems can resemble Haar-random unitaries is a fundamental question in physics. Many experiments of interest in quantum gravity and many-body physics, including the butterfly effect in quantum information scrambling and the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, involve queries to a random unitary $U$ alongside its inverse $U^\dagger$, conjugate $U^*$, and transpose $U^T$. However, conventional notions of approximate unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) fail to capture these experiments. In this work, we introduce and construct strong unitary designs and strong PRUs that remain robust under all such queries. Our constructions achieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits. We further show that strong unitary designs can form in circuit depth $O(\log^2 n)$ in circuits composed of independent two-qubit Haar-random gates, and that strong PRUs can form in circuit depth $\text{poly}(\log n)$ in circuits with no ancilla qubits. Our results provide an operational proof of the fast scrambling conjecture from black hole physics: every observable feature of the fastest scrambling quantum systems reproduces Haar-random behavior at logarithmic times.</description>

      <title>PhotonIDs: ML-Powered Photon Identification System for Dark Count Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable single photon detection is the foundation for practical quantum communication and networking. However, today's superconducting nanowire single photon detector(SNSPD) inherently fails to distinguish between genuine photon events and dark counts, leading to degraded fidelity in long-distance quantum communication. In this work, we introduce PhotonIDs, a machine learning-powered photon identification system that is the first end-to-end solution for real-time discrimination between photons and dark count based on full SNSPD readout signal waveform analysis. PhotonIDs ~demonstrates: 1) an FPGA-based high-speed data acquisition platform that selectively captures the full waveform of signal only while filtering out the background data in real time; 2) an efficient signal preprocessing pipeline, and a novel pseudo-position metric that is derived from the physical temporal-spatial features of each detected event; 3) a hybrid machine learning model with near 98% accuracy achieved on photon/dark count classification. Additionally, proposed PhotonIDs ~ is evaluated on the dark count elimination performance with two real-world case studies: (1) 20 km quantum link, and (2) Erbium ion-based photon emission system. Our result demonstrates that PhotonIDs ~could improve more than 31.2 times of signal-noise-ratio~(SNR) on dark count elimination. PhotonIDs ~ marks a step forward in noise-resilient quantum communication infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: In design and simulation of quantum circuits with multiple units, the computational ability is greatly limited by quickly increasing entanglement, and the ordinary sampling methods normally exhibit low efficiency. Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the nonlocal magic resource and the bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the nonlocal magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. It means, in the practical simulations of quantum circuits, merely small bond dimension suffices to bear with the dynamics of stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy with rank $n=1,2$. On the other hand, the entanglement converges on a bond dimension exponentially scaled in the system size. This remarkable difference reveals that, while the simulation of entanglement on a classical computer is limited, the utilization of nonlocal magic resource as a characterization could make the simulation power much stronger. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement, achieving an indication that it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction of Photons for Quantum Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, is vital for the realization of, e.g., quantum networks, distributed quantum computing, and quantum repeaters. The microwave-to-optical quantum transduction is of particular interest in the field of superconducting quantum computing, since interconnecting dilution refrigerators is considered inevitable for realizing large-scale quantum computers with fault-tolerance. In this review, we overview recent theoretical and experimental studies on the quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons. We describe a generic theory for the quantum transduction employing the input-output formalism, from which the essential quantities characterizing the transduction, i.e., the expressions for the transduction efficiency, the added noise, and the transduction bandwidth are derived. We review the major transduction methods that have been experimentally demonstrated, focusing the transduction via the optomechanical effect, the electro-optic effect, the magneto-optic effect, and the atomic ensembles. We also briefly review the recent experimental progress on the quantum transduction from superconducting qubit to optical photon, which is an important step toward the quantum state transfer between distant superconducting qubits interconnected over optical fibers.</description>

      <title>Robust NbN on Si-SiGe hybrid superconducting-semiconducting microwave quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing large-scale quantum computing requires superconducting circuits that combine long coherence times with compatibility with semiconductor technology. We investigate niobium nitride (NbN) coplanar waveguide resonators integrated with Si/SiGe quantum wells, creating a hybrid platform designed for CMOS-compatible quantum hardware. Using temperature-dependent microwave spectroscopy in the single-photon regime, we examine resonance frequency and quality factor variations to probe the underlying loss mechanisms. Our analysis identifies the roles of two-level systems, quasiparticles, and scattering processes, and connects these losses to wafer properties and fabrication methods. The devices demonstrate reproducible performance and stable operation maintained for over two years, highlighting their robustness. These results provide design guidelines for developing low-loss, CMOS-compatible superconducting circuits and support progress toward resilient, scalable architectures for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits to contrast reversal of self-fidelity correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In measurement design, it is common to engineer anti-contrast readouts -- two measurements that respond as differently as possible to the same inputs so that common-mode contributions are suppressed. To assess the fundamental scope of this strategy in unitary dynamics, we ask whether two evolutions can be made uniformly opposite over a broad input ensemble, or whether quantum mechanics imposes a structural limit on such opposition. We address this by treating self-fidelity (survival probability) as a random variable on projective state space and adopting the Pearson correlation coefficient as a device-agnostic measure of global opposition between two evolutions. Within this framework we establish the following theorem: For any nontrivial pair of unitaries, self-fidelity maps cannot be point-wise complementary correlation on the entire state space. Consequently, the mathematical lower edge of the correlation bound is not physically attainable, which we interpret as a unitary-geometric floor on anti-contrast, independent of hardware specifics and noise models. We make this floor explicit in realizable settings. In a single-qubit Bloch-sphere Ramsey model, a closed-form relation shows that a residual common-mode component persists even under nominally optimal tuning. In higher dimensions, Haar/design moment identities reduce ensemble means and covariances of self-fidelity to a small set of unitary invariants, yielding the same conclusion irrespective of implementation details. Taken together, these results provide a model-independent criterion for what anti-contrast can and cannot achieve in unitary sensing protocols.</description>

      <title>Deterministic single-photon source over the terahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic single-photon source in the terahertz (THz) regime, triggered by a sequence of coherent optical pulses. The scheme leverages the permanent dipole moment of a single-polar quantum emitter to induce THz transitions between optically dressed states, enhanced by a resonant coupling to a hybrid THz cavity. We present a cavity design that delivers high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability while also enabling easy tunability of the emission frequency across the THz range. A key challenge in this new class of dressed-state sources is that, unlike standard solid-state single-photon sources, the dressed nature of the transitions can lead to undesired optical repumping during emission due to spontaneous photon emission in the visible range, which reduces the purity of the THz single-photon state. We show that this issue can be mitigated through optimized pulse areas and a sufficiently high Purcell rate, criteria that are met by our proposed cavity design. Finally, we demonstrate the significant purity enhancement of postselected THz photons by means of optical heralding, illustrating the new opportunities unlocked by the unique integration of terahertz and visible technologies with dressed polar quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Stab-QRAM: An All-Clifford Quantum Random Access Memory for Special Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates (e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By applying K\"{o}nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero $T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck, eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive tasks on emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in different reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works showed that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase difference for a quantum charged particle can be written in terms of electric and magnetic fluxes in a spacetime surface whose boundaries are the possible particle worldlines in the interferometer, relative to the possible paths. After presenting this result in a more detailed way, reinforcing its topological nature, we study the magnetic and electric versions of the AB effect in different inertial reference frames. We find a particular reference frame for a magnetic AB effect where the magnetic flux has a null contribution for the AB phase difference, which is entirely due to an electric flux. Also, we find a particular reference frame for an electric AB effect where the electric flux has a null contribution for the AB phase difference, which is entirely due to a magnetic flux. In this sense, the nomenclatures 'magnetic AB effect' and 'electric AB effect' lose their meaning. We have electromagnetic AB effects.</description>

      <title>Electrical Readout of Spin Environments in Diamond for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are a key platform for quantum sensing and quantum information, combining long coherence times with controllable spin-spin interactions. Most of current quantum algorithms rely on optical access, which limit device integration and applicability in opaque or miniaturized settings. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical approach, photocurrent double electron-electron resonance (PC-DEER), permitting exploiting local dipolar interactions between individual NV spin qubits or ensembles and nearby paramagnetic defects with sub-confocal resolution. PC-DEER extends photocurrent NV readout from single-spin to spin-bath control and coherent manipulation, enabling characterization of bath-induced noise and effective deployment of noise-reduction protocols. We resolve the signatures of substitutional nitrogen (P1) and NVH centers with reproducible contrast by using electrical signals. Our results establish a scalable, optical-free spin readout strategy that bridges fundamental studies of spin environments with deployable quantum technologies, advancing the integration of diamond-based sensors into solid-state quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optics and Quantum Electrodynamics of Strong Field Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In its beginnings, the physics of intense laser-matter interactions was the physics of multiphoton processes. The theory was reduced then to high-order perturbation theory, while treating matter and light in a quantum manner. With the advent of chirped pulse amplification developed by D. Strickland and G. Mourou, which enabled generation of ultra-intense, ultra-short, coherent laser pulses, the need for a quantum electrodynamics description of electromagnetic (EM) fields practically ceased to exist and lost relevance. Contemporary attoscience (AS), and more generally ultrafast laser physics, awarded the Nobel Prize in 2023 to P. Agostini, F. Krausz, and A. L'Huillier, commonly uses the classical description of EM fields while keeping a fully quantum description of matter. The progress and successes of AS in the last 40 years have been spectacular, with an enormous amount of fascinating investigations in basic research and technology. Yet a central question remains: can ultrafast laser physics continue to advance without reintroducing quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics into its description of light-matter interactions? This article discusses future perspectives at the intersection of strong-field physics and quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method for simulating an action of $t$ copies of a Haar random unitary for arbitrary compact groups. This construction can be viewed as a representation-theoretic generalization of Zhandry's compressed function oracle technique. It is conceptually simple, exact and utilizes Clebsch-Gordan transforms as main building blocks. In particular, for the unitary group, our method is efficient in space and time. Finally, our general oracle for forward queries can be easily modified into oracles for conjugate, transpose, and inverse queries, thus unifying all four query types.</description>

      <title>From Quasiperiodicity to a Complete Coloring of the Kohmoto Butterfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra of the Kohmoto model give rise to a fractal phase diagram, known as the Kohmoto butterfly. The butterfly encapsulates the spectra of all periodic Kohmoto Hamiltonians, whose index invariants are sought after. Topological methods - such as Chern numbers - are ill defined due to the discontinuous potential, and hence fail to provide index invariants. This Letter overcomes that obstacle and provides a complete classification of the Kohmoto model indices. Our approach encodes the Kohmoto butterfly as a spectral tree graph, reflecting the quasiperiodic nature via the periodic spectra. This yields a complete coloring of the phase diagram and a new perspective on other spectral butterflies.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <title>High fidelity CNOT gates in photonic integrated circuits using composite segmented directional couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits are a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but their performance is often constrained by component sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Directional couplers, which are crucial building blocks for integrated quantum logic gates, are particularly prone to such limitations, with strong dependence on geometric and spectral parameters which reduces gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that composite segmented directional couplers (CSDC) offer a fabrication-tolerant alternative that enhances gate fidelity without active tuning. We design and fabricate a fully integrated photonic controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate using both uniform and composite coupler variants and compare their performance via simulation, classical characterization, and quantum two-photon interference. The composite design reduces the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and decreases variability fivefold. The residual error is primarily limited by photon indistinguishability. Classical matrix reconstruction confirms improved agreement with the ideal CNOT operation. These results establish CSDCs as compact, passive, and foundry-compatible building blocks for robust scalable quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems with quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization, respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime of the XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory, irrep truncations, and state preparation methods for quantum simulations of SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study methods for efficient preparation of approximate ground states of $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware. Working in a variant of the electric basis, we introduce a refinement of the irrep truncation based on the energy density of site singlets, which provides a finer gradation of simulation complexity. Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop simple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical simulation on small lattices, including the $2\times 2$ plaquette lattice in $d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource requirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and introduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on the public release of \texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building $SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \texttt{pyclebsch}, a package for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to the Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem</title>

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that, similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions, we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework, and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings, including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation and applications in Mean-Field Games.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Diamond-Air Interface as an Efficient Photon Antenna for Solid-State Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting photons from defect centers is challenging due to the high refractive index of typical substrates. For nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, reaching saturation count rates above $2.5\times10^5\,\mathrm{counts}/\mathrm{s}$ so far requires nanofabricated optics like diamond waveguides or solid immersion lenses. Here we present an experimental and theoretical study of defect center emission at unmodified planar dielectric surfaces by quantitative back focal plane imaging and analytical modeling. Our results indicate that photon count rates approaching those of nanofabricated optics can also be achieved by oil-immersion optics. This is due to a dielectric antenna effect which directs the majority of the emission into the substrate within a narrow angle window suitable for back-side collection. By quantifying the collection efficiency of back-side detection, our work also enables a novel measurement method for the quantum efficiency of shallow defect centers. Its result challenges established values. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian topology in cold Rydberg quantum gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems has unveiled new physics beyond the conventional Hermitian paradigm, yet their realization in interacting many-body platforms remains a critical challenge. Exploring this interplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation collectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative Rydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By increasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to non-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex energy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes twisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition with the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different initial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter space that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the scanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking of chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile platform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology, strong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Polynomials and asymptotic constants in a resurgent problem from 't Hooft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent study of the quantum theory of harmonic oscillators, Gerard 't Hooft proposed the following problem: given $G(z)=\sum_{n&gt;0}\sqrt{n}z^n$ for $|z|&lt;1$, find its analytic continuation for $|z|\ge1$, excluding a branch-cut $z\in[1,\,\infty)$. A solution is provided by the bilateral convergent sum $G(z)=\frac12\sqrt{\pi}\sum_{n\in{\mathbb Z}}(2n\pi{\rm i}-\log(z))^{-3/2}$. On the negative real axis, $G(-e^u)$ has a sign-constant asymptotic expansion in $1/u^2$, for large positive $u$. Optimal truncation leaves exponentially suppressed terms in an asymptotic expansion $e^{-u}\sum_{k\ge0}P_k(x)/u^k$, with $P_0(x)=x-\frac23$ and $P_k(x)$ of degree $2k+1$ evaluated at $x=u/2-\lfloor u/2\rfloor$. These polynomials become excellent approximations to sinusoids. The amplitude of $P_k(x)$ increases factorially with $k$ and its phase increases linearly, with $P_k(x)\sim\sin((2k+1)C-2\pi x) R^{2k+1}\Gamma(k+\frac12)/\sqrt{2\pi}$, where $C\approx1.0688539158679530121571$ and $R\approx0.5181839789815558726739$ are asymptotic constants that have been determined at 100-digit precision. Their exact values remain to be identified. This work combines results from David C. Woods, on fractional polylogarithms, with evaluations of Hurwitz zeta values by Pari/GP.</description>

      <title>Nondestructive characterization of laser-cooled atoms using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop machine learning techniques for estimating physical properties of laser-cooled potassium-39 atoms in a magneto-optical trap using only the scattered light -- i.e., fluorescence -- that is intrinsic to the cooling process. In-situ snap-shot images of fluorescing atomic ensembles directly reveal the spatial structure of these millimeter-scale objects but contain no obvious information regarding internal properties such as the temperature. We first assembled and labeled a balanced dataset sampling $8\times10^3$ different experimental parameters that includes examples with: large and dense atomic ensembles, a complete absence of atoms, and everything in between. We describe a range of models trained to predict atom number and temperature solely from fluorescence images. These run the gamut from a poorly performing linear regression model based only on integrated fluorescence to deep neural networks that give number and temperature with fractional uncertainties of $0.1$ and $0.2$ respectively.</description>

Abstract: For the Proca equation, which is a wave equation for a vector field, we derive the canonical formulation including constraints from the Stueckelberg action and propose discrete equations with a structure-preserving scheme for conserving the constraints at the discrete level. Numerical simulations are performed using these discrete equations and other discrete equations with a standard scheme. We show the results obtained using the structure-preserving scheme and provide more accurate and stable numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Probing the Critical Point (CritPt) of AI Reasoning: a Frontier Physics Research Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26574v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian comb effect in coupled clean and quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization properties in a system of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic chain coupled to a uniform chain or clean chain by inter-chain hopping. We find that in the limit of weak inter-chain coupling, such a coupled system exhibits transitions from delocalized to intermediate phase with increase in the non-Hermiticity parameter. However, for stronger inter-chain coupling strengths, the delocalized phase undergoes a transition to localized phase and then to an intermediate phase. Interestingly, the intermediate phase in this case exhibits the non-Hermitian comb effect (NHCE), i.e., the coexistence of localized and extended states rather than being well separated from each other by any mobility edge which is conventional in any intermediate phase. We further show that such a NHCE originates from the isolated site limit of the quasiperiodic chain and provide an analytical explanation supporting the numerical signatures.</description>

      <title>Amplified response of cavity-coupled quantum-critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state, and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08993v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) using two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Graph states are naturally introduced by analogy
  with the qubit case. An arbitrary state of one logical qubit can be obtained through a three-body
  measurement. Furthermore, we propose methods for implementing CZ gates on the components of
  coherent states of BECs in a graph state, as well as CZ gates on logical qubits. A distinctive feature
  of our approach is that the post-measurement state is shown to depend on the particle number.
  These results suggest a novel quantum computing process based on particle control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The speed limits on entanglement are defined as the maximal rate at which entanglement can be generated or degraded in a physical process. We derive the speed limits on entanglement, using the relative entropy of entanglement and trace-distance entanglement, for unitary as well as for arbitrary quantum dynamics, where we assume that the dynamics of the closest separable state can be approximately described by the closest separable dynamics of the actual dynamics of the system. For unitary dynamics of isolated bipartite systems which are described by pure states, the rate of entanglement production is bounded by the product of fluctuations of the system's driving Hamiltonian and the surprisal operator, with an additional term reflecting the time-dependent nature of the closest separable state. Removing restrictions on the purity of the input and on the unitarity of the evolution, the two terms in the bound get suitably altered.
  Furthermore, we find a lower bound on the time required to generate or degrade a certain amount of entanglement by arbitrary quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the tightness of our speed limits on entanglement by considering quantum processes of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Effects of Markovian noise and cavity disorders on the entanglement dynamics of double Jaynes-Cummings models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to prepare and manipulate non-classical states, such as entangled qubits, is fundamental to the development of quantum information processing, communication, and computation. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a double Jaynes-Cummings model, a well-established theoretical framework for studying light-matter interactions that captures essential features of a wide range of quantum systems, including circuit QED, optomechanics, and atomic cavity systems. We examine the model under the influence of Markovian noise and static (glassy) cavity disorder. The study aims to elucidate the impact of these imperfections on entanglement dynamics. The system is initialized with the cavity fields in vacuum and the two atoms in a specific entangled superposition state. Through numerical simulations, we observe that the presence of noise and nonlinear pumping gives rise to nontrivial features in the entanglement evolution, including the emergence of entanglement sudden death (ESD) and subsequent revivals in scenarios where such phenomena are absent in the idealized model. Markovian noise leads to a monotonic decay of entanglement, while disorder tends to wash out the entanglement features. Nonlinear interactions, on the other hand, accelerate the dynamical evolution. The combined and competing effects of noise, disorder, and nonlinearity are systematically analyzed, revealing rich and intricate behavior in the entanglement dynamics. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the robustness and control of entanglement in open quantum systems with imperfections, which is essential for realistic implementations of quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the generative quantum eigensolver (GQE), a new quantum computational framework that operates outside the variational quantum algorithm paradigm by applying classical generative models to quantum simulation. The GQE algorithm optimizes a classical generative model to produce quantum circuits with desired properties. Here, we develop a transformer-based implementation, which we name the generative pre-trained transformer-based (GPT) quantum eigensolver (GPT-QE). We show a proof-of-concept of training and pretraining of GPT-QE applied to electronic structure Hamiltonians, and demonstrate its ability illustrated by surpassing coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) for the strong bond dissociation of the nitrogen molecule and approaching chemical accuracy. We also demonstrate the method on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), the evolution of a quantum system can be restricted to a subspace of its Hilbert space by frequent measurements. A crucial question in QZD of a particle's position is: how short the time interval between successive measurements should be, in order to confine the particle in its initial spatial region? To address this question, we consider a toy model with two ions initially known to be, for simplicity, in a one-dimensional spatial region. By simulating the evolution of this two-body quantum system, we estimate the measurement frequency needed to keep the ions within their initial confined region at a desired confidence level. Two key parameters we employ in our calculations are the Zeno time and the leakage probability of the quantum system. The measurement frequencies are calculated and compared when ions are located initially at different spatial regions. For our simulation, we introduce the Python code {\tt 2IonQZD}.</description>

      <title>Non-coherent evolution of closed weakly interacting system leads to equidistribution of probabilities of microstates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14971v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The transition rates between system states, which characterize the process, are determined by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the time dependence of the mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that, under the given assumptions, it is governed by the Boltzmann collision integral. The proposed mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution is non-coherence. In the presented theory, the non-coherence is not associated with interaction with a heat bath, but rather with the finite spectral width of quantum states. This understanding of non-coherence is analogous to the one used in wave optics. Thus, we present a novel approach to the famous arrow of time problem.</description>

      <title>Generally covariant geometric momentum and geometric potential for a Dirac fermion on a two-dimensional hypersurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric momentum is the appropriate momentum for a particle constrained to move on a curved surface, which depends on the extrinsic curvature and leads to observable effects, and curvature-induced quantum potentials appear for a nonrelativistic free particle on the surface. In the context of multi-component quantum states, the geometric momentum should be rewritten as a generally covariant geometric momentum, which contains an additional term defined as the gauge potential. For a Dirac fermion constrained on a two-dimensional hypersurface, we derive the generally covariant geometric momentum, and demonstrate that no curvature-induced geometric potentials arise on a pseudosphere or a helical surface. The dynamical quantization conditions are verified to be effective in dealing with constrained systems on hypersurfaces, enabling the derivation of both the generally convariant geometric momentum and the geometric potential for a spin particle constrained on parametrically defined surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages quantum computing for classical inference, furnishes the processing of quantum data with machine-learning methods, and provides quantum algorithms adapted to noisy devices. Typically, QML proposals are framed in terms of the circuit model of quantum computation. The alternative measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) paradigm can exhibit lower circuit depths, is naturally compatible with classical co-processing of mid-circuit measurements, and offers a promising avenue towards error correction. Despite significant progress on MBQC devices, QML in terms of MBQC has been hardly explored. We propose the multiple-triangle ansatz (MuTA), a universal quantum neural network assembled from MBQC neurons featuring bias engineering, monotonic expressivity, tunable entanglement, and scalable training. We numerically demonstrate that MuTA can learn a universal set of gates in the presence of noise, a quantum-state classifier, as well as a quantum instrument, and classify classical data using a quantum kernel tailored to MuTA. Finally, we incorporate hardware constraints imposed by photonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits. Our framework lays the foundation for versatile quantum neural networks native to MBQC, allowing to explore MBQC-specific algorithmic advantages and QML on MBQC devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15236v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the quantum error detection scheme Pauli check sandwiching (PCS) to quantum networks by turning it into a distributed multiparty protocol. PCS provides protection on the targeted qubits and generally requires less resource overhead than standard quantum error correction and detection codes. We provide analytical equations for the final fidelity and postselection rate for different PCS checks. We also introduce a recursive version of PCS that generates a family of distance 2 quantum codes that are locally equivalent to Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. Our analytical results are benchmarked against the Bennet-Brassard-Popescu-Schumacher-Smolin-Wooters (BBPSSW) protocol in comparable scenarios. We also perform simulations with noisy gates for entanglement swapping and attain fidelity improvements. Lastly, we discuss various setups and graph state properties of PCS.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz formulas for finite-density Casimir effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Shadows and subsystems of generalized probabilistic theories: when tomographic incompleteness is not a loophole for contextuality proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that failures of tomographic completeness undermine assessments of nonclassicality in noncontextuality experiments. In this work, we study how such failures can indeed lead to mistaken assessments of nonclassicality. We then show that proofs of the failure of noncontextuality are robust to a very broad class of failures of tomographic completeness, including the kinds of failures that are likely to occur in real experiments. We do so by showing that such proofs actually rely on a much weaker assumption that we term relative tomographic completeness: namely, that one's experimental procedures are tomographic for each other. Thus, the failure of noncontextuality can be established even with coarse-grained, effective, emergent, or virtual degrees of freedom. This also implies that the existence of a deeper theory of nature (beyond that being probed in one's experiment) does not in and of itself pose any challenge to proofs of nonclassicality. To prove these results, we first introduce a number of useful new concepts within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). Most notably, we introduce the notion of a GPT subsystem, generalizing a range of preexisting notions of subsystems (including those arising from tensor products, direct sums, decoherence processes, virtual encodings, and more). We also introduce the notion of a shadow of a GPT fragment, which captures the information lost when one's states and effects are unknowingly not tomographic for one another.</description>

      <title>Pancharatnam phase as an entanglement witness for quantum gravity in dual Stern-Gerlach interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in the fundamental tests and practical applications of quantum mechanics. Because entanglement is a feature unique to quantum systems, its observations provide evidence of quantumness. Hence, if gravity can generate entanglement between quantum superpositions, this indicates that quantum amplitudes are field sources and that gravity is quantum. I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers and show that the Pancharatnam phase is a tool that qualitatively distinguishes semiclassical from quantum gravity. The semiclassical evolution is equivalent to that of two independent interferometers in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution in the Bloch sphere. By contrast, in the quantum case, the quantum amplitudes are the sources of the gravitational field, inducing entanglement between the two interferometers, and the phase is continuous.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Winning Certain Coset-Guessing Quantum Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recently introduced coset guessing game, Alice plays against Bob and Charlie, aiming to meet a joint winning condition. Bob and Charlie can only communicate before the game starts to devise a joint strategy. The game we consider begins with Alice preparing a 2m-qubit quantum state based on a random selection of three parameters. She sends the first m qubits to Bob and the rest to Charlie and then reveals to them her choice for one of the parameters. Bob is supposed to guess one of the hidden parameters, Charlie the other, and they win if both guesses are correct. From previous work, we know that the probability of Bob's and Charlie's guesses being simultaneously correct goes to zero exponentially as m increases. We derive a tight upper bound on this probability and show how Bob and Charlie can achieve it. While developing the optimal strategy, we devised an encoding circuit using only CNOT and Hadamard gates, which could be relevant for building efficient CSS-coded systems. We found that the role of quantum information that Alice communicates to Bob and Charlie is to make their responses correlated rather than improve their individual (marginal) correct guessing rates.</description>

Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for high-dimensional nonlinear quantum computation that exploits tensor products of amplified vector and matrix encodings to efficiently evaluate multivariate polynomials. The approach enables the solution of nonlinear equations by quantum implementations of the fixed-point iteration and Newton's method, with quantitative runtime bounds derived in terms of the error tolerance. These results show that a quantum advantage, characterized by a logarithmic scaling of complexity with the dimension of the problem, is preserved. While Newton's method attains near-optimal theoretical complexity, the fixed-point iteration may be better suited to near-term noisy hardware, as supported by our numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Precision metrology underpins scientific and technological advancements. Quantum metrology offers a pathway to surpass classical sensing limits by leveraging quantum states and measurement strategies. However, measuring multiple incompatible observables suffers from quantum backaction, where measurement of one observable pollutes a subsequent measurement of the other. This is a manifestation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for two non-commuting observables, such as position and momentum. Here, we demonstrate measurements of small changes in position and momentum where the uncertainties are simultaneously reduced below the standard quantum limit (SQL). We measure $\textit{modular observables}$ using tailored, highly non-classical states that ideally evade measurement backactions. The states are deterministically prepared in the single mode of the mechanical motion of a trapped ion using an optimal quantum control protocol. Our experiment uses grid states to measure small changes in position and momentum and shows a metrological gain of up to 5.1(5)~dB over the simultaneous SQL. Using an adaptive-phase estimation algorithm with Bayesian inference, we estimate these displacements with a combined variance of 2.6(1.1)~dB below the SQL. Furthermore, we examine simultaneously estimating $\textit{number}$ and $\textit{phase}$, which are the polar counterparts of position and momentum. This is performed by preparing a novel quantum resource -- number-phase states -- and we demonstrate a metrological gain over their SQL. The combination of quantum control and multi-parameter quantum metrology marks a significant step towards unprecedented precision with applications ranging from fundamental physics to advanced quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of A Thermally Bathed Harmonic Oscillator: A Study Based on the Group-theoretical Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator has been extensively studied since the sixties of the last century. Here, with a distinct tool termed the ``group-theoretical characteristic function" (GCF), we investigate analytically how a harmonic oscillator immersed in a thermal environment would relax to its equilibrium state. We assume that the oscillator is at a pure state initially and its evolution is governed by a well-known quantum-optical master equation. By taking advantage of the GCF, the master equation can be transformed into a first-order linear partial differential equation that allows us to write down its solution explicitly. Based on the solution, it is found that, in clear contrast with the monotonic relaxation process of its classical counterpart, the quantum oscillator may demonstrate some intriguing nonmonotonic relaxation characteristics. In particular, when the initial state is a Gaussian state (i.e., a squeezed coherent state), it is found that there is a critical value of the environmental temperature, below which the entropy will first increase to reach its maximum value, then turn down and converge to its equilibrium value from above. For the temperature higher than the critical value, the entropy will converge to its equilibrium value from below monotonically. However, when the initial state is a Fock state, it is found that there is a new phase additional to the previous case, where the time curve of entropy features two extreme points. Namely, the entropy will increase to reach its maximum first, then turn down to reach its minimum, from where it begins to increase and converges to the equilibrium value eventually. Other related issues are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Winning Rates of $(n,k)$ Quantum Coset Monogamy Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game, in which two players must extract complementary information of unequal size ($k$ bits vs. $n-k$ bits) from a random coset state without communicating. The complementary information takes the form of random Pauli-X and Pauli-Z errors on subspace states. Our game generalizes those considered in previous works that deal with the case of equal information size $(k=n/2)$. We prove a convex upper bound of the information-theoretic winning rate of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game in terms of the subspace rate $R=\frac{k}{n}\in [0,1]$. This bound improves upon previous results for the case of $R=1/2$. We also prove the achievability of an optimal winning probability upper bound for the class of unentangled strategies of the $(n,k)$ Coset Monogamy Game.</description>

Abstract: We analyze sharing Bell-type nonlocal correlation between two distant parties with optical hybrid states comprising a single photon polarization state and a multiphoton coherent state. By deploying entanglement swapping over the coherent state parts at the middle station, we show that the optical hybrid states can efficiently generate a polarization-entangled state that violates Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality well over a metropolitan distance. We further assess the quality of the shared entangled state in the information processing task of quantum teleportation of an unknown polarization qubit. Our results with realistic devices, embedding detection inefficiency and transmission losses, indicate the viability of faithful quantum teleportation over large distances, consistent with the quality of the shared correlation.</description>

      <title>Chaos in a Nonlinear Wavefunction Model: An Alternative to Born's Probability Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a prior paper, the author described an instability in a nonlinear wavefunction model. Proposed in connection with the Measurement Problem, the model contained an external potential creating a ``classical'' instability. However, it is interesting to ask whether such models possess an intrinsic randomness -- even ``chaos" -- independent of external potentials. In this work, I investigate the criterion analytically and simulate from a small (``3 qubit") model, demonstrating that the Lyapunov exponent -- a standard measure of ``chaos" -- is positive. I also extend the instability criterion to models in the continuum. These results suggest that the boundary between classical and wavefunction physics may also constitute the threshold of chaos, and present an alternative to Max Born's ad hoc probability hypothesis: random outcomes in experiments result not from ``wave-particle duality" or ``the existence of the quantum," but from sensitive dependence on initial conditions, as is common in the other sciences.</description>

      <title>Alternating and Gaussian fermionic Isometric Tensor Network States</title>

Abstract: Isometric tensor networks in two dimensions enable efficient and accurate study of quantum many-body states, yet the effect of the isometric restriction on the represented quantum states is not fully understood. We address this question in two main contributions. First, we introduce an improved variant of isometric network states (isoTNS) in two dimensions, where the isometric arrows on the columns of the network alternate between pointing upward and downward, hence the name alternating isometric tensor network states. Second, we introduce a numerical tool -- isometric Gaussian fermionic TNS (isoGfTNS) -- that incorporates isometric constraints into the framework of Gaussian fermionic tensor network states. We demonstrate in numerous ways that alternating isoTNS represent many-body ground states of two-dimensional quantum systems significantly better than the original isoTNS. First, we show that the entanglement in an isoTNS is mediated along the isometric arrows and that alternating isoTNS mediate entanglement more efficiently than conventional isoTNS. Second, alternating isoTNS correspond to a deeper, thus more representative, sequential circuit construction of depth $O(L_x \cdot L_y)$ compared to the original isoTNS of depth $O(L_x + L_y)$. Third, using the Gaussian framework and gradient-based energy minimization, we provide numerical evidences of better bond-dimension scaling and variational energy of alternating isoGfTNS for ground states of various free fermionic models, including the Fermi surface, the band insulator, and the $p_x + ip_y$ mean-field superconductor. Finally, we find improved performance of alternating isoTNS as compared to the original isoTNS for the ground state energy of the (interacting) transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Low-loss polarization-maintaining router for single and entangled photons at a telecom wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon polarization serves as an essential quantum information carrier in quantum information and measurement applications. Routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and polarization-entangled photons is a crucial technology for scaling up quantum information applications. Here, we demonstrate a low-loss, noiseless, polarization-maintaining routing of arbitrarily polarized single photons and, crucially, multi-photon entangled states where the entanglement is encoded in orthogonal polarization bases, at the telecom L-band. Our interferometer-based router is constructed by optics with a low angle of incidence and cross-aligned electro-optic crystals, achieving the polarization-maintaining operation with a minimal number of optical components. We demonstrate the routing of arbitrarily-polarized heralded single photons with a 0.057 dB (1.3%) loss, a $&gt;$ 22 dB switching extinction ratio, and $&gt;$ 99% polarization process fidelity to ideal identity operation. Moreover, the high-quality router achieves the routing of two-photon N00N-type entangled states with a highly maintained interference visibility of $\approx$ 97%. The demonstrated router scheme preserving multi-photon polarization state paves the way toward polarization-encoded photonic quantum networks as well as multi-photon entanglement synthesis via spatial- and time-multiplexing techniques.</description>

      <title>Role of Matter Interactions in Superradiant Phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superradiant phenomenon, usually described by the Dicke model, is a hallmark of strong light-matter interaction. We explore how matter-matter interactions influence this phenomenon by performing ground-state simulations of Dicke-like models with both isotropic and anisotropic spin couplings. We find that Ising-type interactions produce two qualitatively distinct phase boundaries, one of which gives rise to an antiferromagnetic-normal phase connected to the superradiant regime via a first-order phase transition. Under anisotropic couplings, we uncover a strongly correlated phase where in-plane spin order coexists with superradiance, exhibiting sublinear scaling of the photon occupation per site and power-law decay of spin correlations. Furthermore, superradiance can be strengthened by tuning either isotropic or anisotropic interactions, highlighting the role of intrinsic many-body correlations in shaping light-matter quantum phases.</description>

      <title>How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For one-dimensional non-interacting complex fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after saturation, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurements protocols. In the thermodynamic limit, the system is in the area-law phase for any monitoring strength, however we can also study the distribution in the critical phase characterized by a logarithmic scaling of the EE with system size by considering a sufficiently weak monitoring strength. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero, likely a precursor of Zeno effect, that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength. Intriguingly, the distribution is spatially inhomogeneous. For sites around the boundary separating the subsystems defining the EE, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. As the monitoring strength increases, the full distribution is controlled by the boundary sites. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, where the change in EE is defined between two consecutive time steps, the distribution, Gaussian for weak monitoring, gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. For strong monitoring, the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores foundational aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs). We analyze how the expressibility of semantic features scales exponentially with embedding space dimensions using quasi-orthogonal vectors. We contrast the dynamic, context-dependent embeddings of Transformer architectures, which resolve polysemy, with a static vector approach based on quantum contextuality. Stochasticity is framed as an essential feature for enabling creative output through probabilistic sampling. Finally, we propose quantum attention as a unitary extension of classical mechanisms, reframing LLM processing as reversible, quantum-like evolutions in Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Saturation of Quantum Cramer-Rao Bounds for Distributed Sensing via Error Sensitivity in SU(1,1)-SU(m) Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breaking the standard quantum limit in the sensing of parameters at different spatial locations, such as in a quantum network, is of great importance. Using the framework of quantum Fisher information, many strategies based on squeezed quantum probes and multipath multiphoton or multiqubit entangled states have been considered. In this context there is always the question of what is the simplest measurement that would saturate quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB). The simplest quantity to measure would be characteristics of photon flux or population distribution in case of qubits. Previous studies have shown that the error sensitivity in SU(1,1) interferometry, also known by several other names as nonlinear interferometry, time reversed measurements; does saturate QCRB for single parameters like phase, displacement, loss. In this work we bring out great utility of generalized SU(1,1) interferometry in distributed sensing. The generalized SU(1,1) interferometry is a combination of SU(m) and SU(1,1) elements, where m is the number of nodes in the network. The SU(m) element is used to produce distributed entanglement starting from a squeezed photonic or matter probe. We demonstrate how error sensitivity measurement at just one output port can saturate or nearly saturate QCRB and thus results in Heisenberg sensitivity of network sensing.</description>

      <title>Physics-Inspired Extrapolation for efficient error mitigation and hardware certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is essential for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, and will remain relevant for early fault-tolerant quantum computers, where logical error rates are still significant. However, most QEM methods incur an exponential sampling overhead to achieve unbiased estimates, limiting their practical applicability. Recently, error mitigation by restricted evolution was shown to estimate expectation values with constant sampling overhead, albeit with a small bias that grows with circuit size and noise level. Building upon the EMRE framework, here, we propose physics-inspired extrapolation, a linear circuit runtime protocol that achieves enhanced accuracy without incurring substantial overhead. Unlike traditional zero-noise extrapolation methods, PIE provides an operational interpretation of its fitting parameters and converges to unbiased estimates as noise decreases. Distinctively, the slope of the extrapolation fit corresponds to the max-relative entropy between the ideal and noisy circuits, enabling quantitative hardware certification alongside error mitigation, with no additional computational overhead. We also demonstrate the efficacy of this method on IBMQ hardware and apply it to simulate 84-qubit quantum dynamics efficiently. Our results show that PIE yields accurate, low-variance error mitigated estimates, establishing it as a practical and scalable strategy for both error mitigation and hardware certification for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>TensorRL-QAS: Reinforcement learning with tensor networks for improved quantum architecture search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. In spite of the promise, they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design process of quantum circuits, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and hardware noise. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, an improved framework that combines tensor network methods with RL for QAS. By warm-starting the QAS with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits and accelerates the convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces classical optimizer function evaluation by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to 98$\%$, and can achieve 50$\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems, far exceeding the $&lt;$1$\%$ rates of baseline. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of an 8-qubit system. Furthermore, TensorRL-QAS demonstrates effectiveness on systems on 20-qubit quantum systems, positioning it as a state-of-the-art quantum circuit discovery framework for near-term hardware and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Lie Algebra of XY-mixer Topologies and Warm Starting QAOA for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The XY-mixer has widespread utilization in modern quantum computing, including in variational quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA). The XY ansatz is particularly useful for solving Cardinality Constrained Optimization tasks, a large class of important NP-hard problems. First, we give explicit decompositions of the dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) associated with a variety of $XY$-mixer topologies. When these DLAs admit simple Lie algebra decompositions, they are efficiently trainable. An example of this scenario is a ring $XY$-mixer with arbitrary $R_Z$ gates. Conversely, when we allow for all-to-all $XY$-mixers or include $R_{ZZ}$ gates, the DLAs grow exponentially and are no longer efficiently trainable.
  We provide numerical simulations showcasing these concepts on Portfolio Optimization, Sparsest $k$-Subgraph, and Graph Partitioning problems. These problems correspond to exponentially-large DLAs and we are able to warm-start these optimizations by pre-training on polynomial-sized DLAs by restricting the gate generators. This results in improved convergence to high quality optima of the original task, providing dramatic performance benefits in terms of solution sampling and approximation ratio on optimization tasks for both shared angle and multi-angle QAOA.</description>

Abstract: For a quantum secret sharing scheme built from a general quantum stabilizer code, no measurement-free circuit has been known for reconstructing its quantum secrets, except particular classes, such as one proposed by Cleve, Gottesman and Lo. We propose a measurement-free reconstruction circuit of quantum secrets in quantum secret sharing based on stabilizer codes. Our reconstruction circuit has width $k+|J|$ and consists of $O(k|J|)$ one- or two-qudit unitary gates when $|J|$ participants reconstruct $k$-qudit quantum secrets.</description>

      <title>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.</description>

Abstract: No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intersection of quantum computing and quantum chemistry represents a promising frontier for achieving quantum utility in domains of both scientific and societal relevance. Owing to the exponential growth of classical resource requirements for simulating quantum systems, quantum chemistry has long been recognized as a natural candidate for quantum computation. This perspective focuses on identifying scientifically meaningful use cases where early fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are considered to be equipped with approximately 25--100 logical qubits, could deliver tangible impact. While recent advances in classical computing have pushed the boundaries of tractable simulations to unprecedented scales, this logical-qubit regime represents the first window where quantum devices can pursue qualitatively distinct strategies, such as polynomial-scaling phase estimation, direct simulation of quantum dynamics, and active-space embedding, that remain challenging for classical solvers, for instance, multireference charge-transfer and conical-intersection states central to photochemistry and materials design. We highlight near-term opportunities in algorithm and software design, discuss representative chemical problems suited for quantum acceleration, and propose strategic roadmaps and collaborative pathways for advancing practical quantum utility in quantum chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a framework for approximating special kinds of discrete optimization problems that relies on problem structure in a way that sets it apart from other classical or quantum approaches. We show that the instances of MaxCut on which DQI attains a nontrivial asymptotic approximation guarantee are solvable exactly in classical polynomial time. We include a streamlined exposition of DQI tailored for MaxCut that relies on elementary graph theory instead of coding theory to motivate and explain the algorithm.</description>

      <title>On a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usual position-momentum commutation relation plays a fundamental role in the mathematical description of continuous-variable quantum systems. In the case of a qudit described by a Hilbert space of a high enough dimension, there exists a discrete version of the position-momentum commutation relation approximately satisfied by a large part of the pure quantum states. Our purpose is to explore in more details the set of these states. We show that it contains a family of discrete-variable Gaussian states depending on a continuous parameter and certain discrete coherent states. It also contains various discrete-variable versions of the Hermite-Gauss states, defined either as eigenstates of certain discrete versions of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian or generated by using a discrete version of the creation or annihilation operator. As a direct consequence, a discrete version of the incertitude relation is satisfied by the considered quantum states.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Quantum State Engineering with Postselected von Neumann Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a feasible protocol for generating non-Gaussian (nG) states via postselected von Neumann measurement for continuous-variable quantum information processing. The method uses a two-level system coupled to a Gaussian pointer state through an observable $A$ with $A^{2}=\mathbb{I}$. By operating beyond the weak-coupling regime and selecting different pointer states -- squeezed, coherent, or vacuum -- allows generation of a wide range of nG states, including squeezed cat states, two-mode entangled cat states, approximate Bell states, and a continuum of intermediate nG states with considerable success probabilities. The properties of these states are widely tunable via the postselection-induced weak value and the measurement interaction strength. We characterize the non-Gaussianity via Wigner function negativities and quantify entanglement using linear entropy and concurrence. The protocol offers a scalable route to high-purity nG state engineering.</description>

      <title>Continuous Wave Quantum Detection and Ranging with quantum heterodyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the continuous-wave Detection and Ranging technology, simultaneous and accurate range and velocity measurements of an unknown target are typically achieved using a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) with a heterodyne receiver. The high time-bandwidth product of the FMCW waveform facilitates the optimization and high-precision of these measurements while maintaining low transmission power. Despite recent efforts to develop the quantum counterpart of this technology, a quantum protocol for FMCW that enhances measurement precision in lossy channels with background noise has yet to be established. Here, we propose a quantum illumination protocol for FMCW technology that utilizes sum frequency generation and an entangled light source with low transmission power. This protocol demonstrates a 3 dB enhancement in the precision limit for high-loss channels compared to classical approaches, independent of the background noise level. This precision limit is achieved through quantum heterodyne detection (QHD), followed by signal processing. Moreover, in classical approaches, QHD is only optimal in high-loss channels when strong background noise is present. In weak background noise scenarios, our protocol can further provides precision enhancements up to 6 dB over classical methods with QHD.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical phonon pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-correlated photon pairs are crucial resources for modern quantum information science. Similarly, the reliable generation of nonclassical phonon pairs is vital for advancing engineerable solid-state quantum devices and hybrid quantum networks based on phonons. Here, we present a novel approach to generate quantum-correlated phonon pairs in a suspended silicon microstructure initialized in its motional ground state. By simultaneously implementing red- and blue-detuned laser pulses, equivalent high-order optomechanical nonlinearity -- specifically, an effective optomechanical four-wave mixing process -- is achieved for generating a nonclassical phonon pair, which is then read out via a subsequent red-detuned pulse. We demonstrate the nonclassical nature of the generated phonon pair through the violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Our experimentally observed phonon pair violates the classical bound by more than 5 standard deviations and maintains a decoherence time of 132 ns. This work reveals novel quantum manipulation of phonon states enabled by equivalent high-order optomechanical nonlinearity within a pulse scheme and provides a valuable quantum resource for mechanical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A physical approach to qualia and the emergence of conscious observers in qualia space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose that qualia are physical because they are directly observable, and revisit the contentious link between consciousness and quantum measurements from a new perspective -- one that does not rely on observers or wave function collapse but instead treats physical measurements as fundamental in a sense resonant with Wheeler's it-from-bit. Building on a mathematical definition of measurement space in physics, I reinterpret it as a model of qualia, effectively equating the measurement problem of quantum mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness. The resulting framework falls within panpsychism, and offers potential solutions to the combination problem. Moreover, some of the mathematical structure of measurement spaces, taken for granted in physics, needs justification for qualia, suggesting that the apparent solidity of physical reality is deeply rooted in how humans process information.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods from Quantum Information Theory are used to scrutinize quantum correlations encoded in the two-quark density matrix over light-cone momentum fractions $x_1$ and $x_2$. A non-perturbative three quark model light-cone wavefunction predicts significant non-classical correlations associated with the "entanglement negativity" measure for asymmetric and small quark momentum fractions. We perform one step of QCD scale evolution of the entire density matrix, not just its diagonal (dPDF), by computing collinearly divergent corrections due to the emission of a gluon. Finally, we present first qualitative numerical results for single-step scale evolution of quantum entanglement correlations in double quark PDFs. At a higher $Q^2$ scale, the non-classical correlations manifest in the dPDF for nearly symmetric momentum fractions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity is a crucial step in uniting these two ideas. In recent works [1-7], the loss of coherence of quantum spatial superpositions is explored in the context of the local and global properties of spacetime. Moreover, Danielson et al [2, 3] showed that this decoherence is directly related to the memory effect, which is a prominent feature of gravitational radiation. We therefore seek to explore how a burst of gravitational radiation from a far-away source can effect the coherence of a quantum superposition. In this paper, we identify the individual contributions to the decoherence from the oscillatory and memory components of the incident gravitational wave, corresponding to hard and soft graviton emissions, respectively. In general, the memory contributions dominate, while the oscillatory component of the decoherence is strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work demonstrates how decoherence in quantum systems can arise from interactions with a classical gravitational field. We also briefly comment on the electromagnetic analogue of this effect and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.</description>

      <title>The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by re-examining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T remains a technical challenge due to field inhomogeneity and prolonged T1 values. The aim of this study is to develop an accurate and clinically applicable myocardial T1 mapping technique for 5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and validate its performance in a multicenter study. Methods: The proposed method is based on a 5-(3)-3 MOLLI sequence, dubbed combined-correction MOLLI (coMOLLI), which corrects for both inversion efficiency and readout-induced signal disturbances. Specifically, coMOLLI employs a gradient recalled echo (GRE) readout rather than the commonly used bSSFP readout. Its signal evolution is modeled to estimate T1 values, which incorporates both inversion efficiency and readout disturbances to improve fitting accuracy. To further enhance accuracy, the inversion pulse was redesigned under hardware constraints and the observed B0 and B1 variations over the heart at 5T, using adiabatic hyperbolic secant (HSn) and tangent/hyperbolic tangent (Tan/Tanh) pulses. The method was validated in phantom experiments, as well as in 21 healthy volunteers and 9 patients. Results: The optimized inversion pulse at 5T is the Tan/Tanh pulse with A = 10 kHz, K_s = 4, k = 22, and T_p = 8 ms. In phantom studies, coMOLLI showed high accuracy versus reference IR-FSE, yielding relative errors within 5% for all nine vials. In vivo studies, the average native myocardial T1 values across 21 healthy volunteers were 1468 +/- 48 ms, 1514 +/- 39 ms, and 1545 +/- 50 ms, and blood T1 values were 2182 +/- 132 ms, 2124 +/- 153 ms, and 2131 +/- 158 ms for apical, middle, and base slices, respectively. Conclusion: The coMOLLI method demonstrated high accuracy in phantom studies and feasibility in vivo studies. By adopting the widely used 5-(3)-3 MOLLI acquisition scheme, it shows potential for clinical cardiac imaging at 5T.</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich/complex-scaling regularization and rigged Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating the Zel'dovich regularization, the complex scaling method, and the rigged Hilbert space. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. Also, we find the most essential regulator of functional analyticity and construct a modified Hilbert space of the exact WKB framework for resonance, which is called the rigged Hilbert space. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description>
