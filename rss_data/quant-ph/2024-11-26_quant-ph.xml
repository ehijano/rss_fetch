      <title>Coherence in Property Testing: Quantum-Classical Collapses and Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the power and limitations of classical and quantum information and how they differ is a fundamental endeavor. In property testing of distributions, a tester is given samples over a typically large domain $\{0,1\}^n$. An important property is the support size both of distributions [Valiant and Valiant, STOC'11], as well, as of quantum states. Classically, even given $2^{n/16}$ samples, no tester can distinguish distributions of support size $2^{n/8}$ from $2^{n/4}$ with probability better than $2^{-\Theta(n)}$, even promised they are flat.
  Quantum states can be in a coherent superposition of states of $\{0,1\}^n$, so one may ask if coherence can enhance property testing. Flat distributions naturally correspond to subset states, $|\phi_S \rangle=1/\sqrt{|S|}\sum_{i\in S}|i\rangle$. We show that coherence alone is not enough, Coherence limitations: Given $2^{n/16}$ copies, no tester can distinguish subset states of size $2^{n/8}$ from $2^{n/4}$ with probability better than $2^{-\Theta(n)}$.
  The hardness persists even with multiple public-coin AM provers, Classical hardness with provers: Given $2^{O(n)}$ samples from a distribution and $2^{O(n)}$ communication with AM provers, no tester can estimate the support size up to factors $2^{\Omega(n)}$ with probability better than $2^{-\Theta(n)}$. Our result is tight.
  In contrast, coherent subset state proofs suffice to improve testability exponentially, Quantum advantage with certificates: With poly-many copies and subset state proofs, a tester can approximate the support size of a subset state of arbitrary size.
  Some structural assumption on the quantum proofs is required since we show, Collapse of QMA: A general proof cannot improve testability of any quantum property whatsoever.
  We also show connections to disentangler and quantum-to-quantum transformation lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Electrodynamical Density-Functional Theory Exemplified by the Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key features of density-functional theory (DFT) within a minimal implementation of quantum electrodynamics are demonstrated, thus allowing to study elementary properties of quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT). We primarily employ the quantum Rabi model, that describes a two-level system coupled to a single photon mode, and also discuss the Dicke model, where multiple two-level systems couple to the same photon mode. In these settings, the density variables of the system are the polarization and the displacement of the photon field. We give analytical expressions for the constrained-search functional and the exchange-correlation potential and compare to established results from QEDFT. We further derive a form for the adiabatic connection that is almost explicit in the density variables, up to only a non-explicit correlation term that gets bounded both analytically and numerically. This allows several key features of DFT to be studied without approximations.</description>

      <title>Imperfect-Information Games on Quantum Computers: A Case Study in Skat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades it is known that Quantum Computers might serve as a tool to solve a very specific kind of problems that have long thought to be incalculable. Some of those problems are of a combinatorial nature, with the quantum advantage arising from the exploding size of a huge decision tree. Although this is of high interest as well, there are more opportunities to make use of the quantum advantage among non-perfect information games with a limited amount of steps within the game. Even though it is not possible to answer the question for the winning move in a specific situation, people are rather interested in what choice gives the best outcome in the long run. This leads us to the search for the highest number of paths within the game's decision tree despite the lack of information and, thus, to a maximum of the payoff-function. We want to illustrate on how Quantum Computers can play a significant role in solving these kind of games, using an example of the most popular German card game Skat. Therefore we use quantum registers to encode the game's information properly and construct the corresponding quantum gates in order to model the game progress and obey the rules. Finally, we use a score operator to project the quantum state onto the winning subspace and therefore evaluate the winning probability for each alternative decision by the player to be made by using quantum algorithms, such as quantum counting of the winning paths to gain a possible advantage in computation speed over classical approaches. Thus, we get a reasonable recommendation of how to act at the table due to the payoff-function maximization. This approach is clearly not doable on a classical computer due to the huge tree-search problem and we discuss peculiarities of the problem that may lead to a quantum advantage when exceeding a certain problem size.</description>

      <title>Lie-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves the identification of rare signals over conventional backgrounds. Thus binary classification tasks are ubiquitous in analyses of the vast amounts of LHC data. We develop a Lie-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lie-EQGNN), a quantum model that is not only data efficient, but also has symmetry-preserving properties. Since Lorentz group equivariance has been shown to be beneficial for jet tagging, we build a Lorentz-equivariant quantum GNN for quark-gluon jet discrimination and show that its performance is on par with its classical state-of-the-art counterpart LorentzNet, making it a viable alternative to the conventional computing paradigm.</description>

      <title>Mera: Memory Reduction and Acceleration for Quantum Circuit Simulation via Redundancy Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of quantum computing, quantum processor demonstrates the potential supremacy in specific applications, such as Grovers database search and popular quantum neural networks (QNNs). For better calibrating the quantum algorithms and machines, quantum circuit simulation on classical computers becomes crucial. However, as the number of quantum bits (qubits) increases, the memory requirement grows exponentially. In order to reduce memory usage and accelerate simulation, we propose a multi-level optimization, namely Mera, by exploring memory and computation redundancy. First, for a large number of sparse quantum gates, we propose two compressed structures for low-level full-state simulation. The corresponding gate operations are designed for practical implementations, which are relieved from the longtime compression and decompression. Second, for the dense Hadamard gate, which is definitely used to construct the superposition, we design a customized structure for significant memory saving as a regularity-oriented simulation. Meanwhile, an ondemand amplitude updating process is optimized for execution acceleration. Experiments show that our compressed structures increase the number of qubits from 17 to 35, and achieve up to 6.9 times acceleration for QNN.</description>

      <title>Boosting Photon-Number-Resolved Detection Rates of Transition-Edge Sensors by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition-Edge Sensors (TESs) are very effective photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors that have enabled many photonic quantum technologies. However, their relatively slow thermal recovery time severely limits their operation rate in experimental scenarios compared to leading non-PNR detectors. In this work, we develop an algorithmic approach that enables TESs to detect and accurately classify photon pulses without waiting for a full recovery time between detection events. We propose two machine-learning-based signal processing methods: one supervised learning method and one unsupervised clustering method. By benchmarking against data obtained using coherent states and squeezed states, we show that the methods extend the TES operation rate to 800 kHz, achieving at least a four-fold improvement, whilst maintaining accurate photon-number assignment up to at least five photons. Our algorithms will find utility in applications where high rates of PNR detection are required and in technologies which demand fast active feed-forward of PNR detection outcomes.</description>

      <title>Unwanted couplings can induce amplification in quantum memories despite negligible apparent noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical quantum memory design often involves selectively focusing on certain energy levels to mimic an ideal $\Lambda$-configuration, a common approach that may unintentionally overlook the impact of neighboring levels or undesired couplings. While this simplification may be justified in certain protocols or platforms, it can significantly distort the achievable memory performance. Through numerical semi-classical analysis, we show that the presence of unwanted energy levels and undesired couplings in an NV-center-based absorptive memory can significantly amplify the signal, resulting in memory efficiencies exceeding unity, a clear indication of unwanted noise at the quantum level. This effect occurs even when the apparent noise i.e., output in the absence of an input field, is negligible. We then use semi-analytical estimates to analyze the amplification and propose a strategy for reducing it. Our results are potentially relevant for other memory platforms beyond the example of NV centers.</description>

      <title>Detection of a semitransparent object with no exchange of quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity for the purpose of detecting partially absorbing objects placed inside without photon exchange. Utilizing the input-output formalism, we quantitatively relate the probability of correctly inferring the presence or absence of the object to the probability of avoiding absorption. We show that, if the cavity decay rate due to absorption by the object is comparable to that of the empty cavity and to the object-induced detuning, the product of the two probabilities is maximized by an undercoupled cavity, in which case detection in transmission is favorable to that in reflection. These results are contrary to the case of a perfect absorber, thus adding to the body of work pertaining to interaction-free measurement schemes and providing insight into optimizing their efficiency when detecting realistic objects.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bitcoin Address Classification Using Quantum-Inspired Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over 900 million Bitcoin transactions have been recorded, posing considerable challenges for machine learning in terms of computation time and maintaining prediction accuracy. We propose an innovative approach using quantum-inspired algorithms implemented with Simulated Annealing and Quantum Annealing to address the challenge of local minima in solution spaces. This method efficiently identifies key features linked to mixer addresses, significantly reducing model training time. By categorizing Bitcoin addresses into six classes: exchanges, faucets, gambling, marketplaces, mixers, and mining pools, and applying supervised learning methods, our results demonstrate that feature selection with SA reduced training time by 30.3% compared to using all features in a random forest model while maintaining a 91% F1-score for mixer addresses. This highlights the potential of quantum-inspired algorithms to swiftly and accurately identify high-risk Bitcoin addresses based on transaction features.</description>

      <title>Faithful quantum teleportation via a nanophotonic nonlinear Bell state analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networking protocols, including quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping, use linear-optical Bell state measurements for heralding the distribution and transfer of quantum information. However, a linear-optical Bell state measurement requires identical photons and is susceptible to errors caused by multiphoton emission, fundamentally limiting the efficiency and fidelity of quantum networking protocols. Here we show a nonlinear Bell state analyzer for time-bin encoded photons based on a nanophotonic cavity with efficient sum-frequency generation to filter multiphoton emissions, and utilize it for faithful quantum teleportation involving spectrally distinct photons with fidelities $\geq 94\%$ down to the single-photon level. Our result demonstrates that nonlinear-optical entangling operations, empowered by our efficient nanophotonics platform, can realize faithful quantum information protocols without requiring identical photons and without the fundamental limit on the efficiency and fidelity of a Bell state measurement imposed by linear optics, which facilitates the realization of practical quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks provide a novel framework for quantum information processing, significantly enhancing system capacity through the interconnection of modular quantum nodes. Beyond the capability to distribute quantum states, the ability to remotely control quantum gates is a pivotal step for quantum networks. In this Letter, we implement high fidelity quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate teleportation with state-of-the-art silicon photonic integrated circuits. Based on on-chip generation of path-entangled quantum state, CNOT gate operation and chip-to-chip quantum photonic interconnect, the CNOT gate is teleported between two remote quantum nodes connected by the single-mode optical fiber. Equip with 5 m (1 km)-long interconnecting fiber, quantum gate teleportation is verified by entangling remote qubits with 95.69% +- 1.19% (94.07% +- 1.54%) average fidelity and gate tomography with 94.81% +- 0.81% (93.04% +- 1.09%) fidelity. These results advance the realization of large-scale and practical quantum networks with photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>The Gravito-Phononic Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photo-electric effect was a historic milestone in the development of quantum theory, revealing the first evidence of discrete energy of the electromagnetic field through hallmark signatures such as the threshold frequency, intensity-independent energy transfer, and the near instantaneous ejection of photo-electrons. In this work, we revisit the photo-electric effect through the lens of semi-classical, quantum, and neo-classical models to explore their implications on energy conservation and discrete photon exchange. We extend this analysis to include the gravito-phononic effect through modelling energy transfer between coupled harmonic oscillators, rather than traditional atom-field interactions. Our approach demonstrates that two coupled harmonic oscillators, under a beam-splitter interaction, can exhibit hallmark signatures analogous to the photo-electric effect, including resonance conditions and quantised energy absorption. We discuss the implications of this model for the recently proposed gravito-phononic detections of single gravitons. This further clarifies that a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect, modelled as discrete energy transfer between harmonic oscillators can provide the first evidence of the graviton.</description>

      <title>Four-Qubit CHSH Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the CHSH quantum game is extended to four players. This is achieved by exploring all possible 4-variable Boolean functions to identify those that yield a game scenario with a quantum advantage using a specific entangled state. Notably, two new four-player quantum games are presented. In one game, the optimal quantum strategy is achieved when players share a $GHZ$-state, breaking the traditional 10\% gain observed in 2 and 3 qubit CHSH games and achieving a 22.5\% gap. In the other game, players gain a greater advantage using a $W$-state as their quantum resource. Quantum games with other four-qubit entangled states are also explored. To demonstrate the results, these game scenarios are implemented on an online quantum computer, and the advantage of the respective quantum resource for each game is experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Derivation of recursive formulas for integrals of Hermite polynomial products and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive three recursive formulas for the integrals of products of Hermite polynomials. The derivation is notably straightforward, relying solely on the well-established properties of Hermite polynomials and the technique of integration by parts. These results hold broad relevance across various fields of physics and mathematics. Specifically, they would be applied to accurately compute two- and three-body matrix elements in ab initio simulations of one-dimensional few-body systems confined in harmonic traps. Additionally, we provide a numerical subroutine that implements these recursive formulas, which accompanies this work.</description>

      <title>Majority-Agreed Key Distribution using Absolutely Maximally Entangled Stabilizer States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Phys. Rev. A 77, 060304(R),(2008)], Facchi et al. introduced absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states and also suggested ``majority-agreed key distribution"(MAKD) as a possible application for such states. In MAKD, the qubits of an AME state are distributed one each to many spatially separated parties. AME property makes it necessary that quantum key distribution(QKD) between any two parties can only be performed with the cooperation of a majority of parties. Our contributions to MAKD are, $(1)$ We recognize that stabilizer structure of the shared state is a useful addition to MAKD and prove that the cooperation of any majority of parties(including the two communicants) is necessary and sufficient for QKD between any two parties sharing AME stabilizer states. Considering the rarity of qubit AME states, we extended this result to the qudit case. $(2)$ We generalize to shared graph states that are not necessarily AME. We show that the stabilizer structure of graph states allows for QKD between any inseparable bipartition of qubits. Inseparability in graph states is visually apparent in the connectivity of its underlying mathematical graph. We exploit this connectivity to demonstrate conference keys and multiple independent keys per shared state. Recent experimental and theoretical progress in graph state preparation and self-testing make these protocols feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>An unconditional distribution learning advantage with shallow quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the core challenges of research in quantum computing is concerned with the question whether quantum advantages can be found for near-term quantum circuits that have implications for practical applications. Motivated by this mindset, in this work, we prove an unconditional quantum advantage in the probably approximately correct (PAC) distribution learning framework with shallow quantum circuit hypotheses. We identify a meaningful generative distribution learning problem where constant-depth quantum circuits using one and two qubit gates (QNC^0) are superior compared to constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits (NC^0) as a choice for hypothesis classes. We hence prove a PAC distribution learning separation for shallow quantum circuits over shallow classical circuits. We do so by building on recent results by Bene Watts and Parham on unconditional quantum advantages for sampling tasks with shallow circuits, which we technically uplift to a hyperplane learning problem, identifying non-local correlations as the origin of the quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted diffusive dynamics in superconducting quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random fluctuations caused by environmental noise can lead to decoherence in quantum systems. Exploring and controlling such dissipative processes is both fundamentally intriguing and essential for harnessing quantum systems to achieve practical advantages and deeper insights. In this Letter, we first demonstrate the diffusive dynamics assisted by controlled dephasing noise in superconducting quantum circuits, contrasting with coherent evolution. We show that dephasing can enhance localization in a superconducting qubit array with quasiperiodic order, even in the regime where all eigenstates remain spatially extended for the coherent counterpart. Furthermore, by preparing different excitation distributions in the qubit array, we observe that a more localized initial state relaxes to a uniformly distributed mixed state faster with dephasing noise, illustrating another counterintuitive phenomenon called Mpemba effect, i.e., a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward the equilibrium faster. These results deepen our understanding of diffusive dynamics at the microscopic level, and demonstrate controlled dissipative processes as a valuable tool for investigating Markovian open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Faulty towers: recovering a functioning quantum random access memory in the presence of defective routers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposals for quantum random access memory (QRAM) generally have a binary-tree structure, and thus require hardware that is exponential in the depth of the QRAM. For solid-state based devices, a fabrication yield that is less than $100\%$ implies that certain addresses at the bottom of the tree become inaccessible if a router in the unique path to that address is faulty. We discuss how to recover a functioning QRAM in the presence of faulty routers. We present the \texttt{IterativeRepair} algorithm, which constructs QRAMs layer by layer until the desired depth is reached. This algorithm utilizes ancilla flag qubits which reroute queries to faulty routers. We present a classical algorithm \texttt{FlagQubitMinimization} that attempts to minimize the required number of such ancilla. For a router failure rate of $1\%$ and a QRAM of depth $n=13$, we expect that on average 430 addresses need repair: we require only 1.5 ancilla flag qubits on average to perform this rerouting.</description>

      <title>NN-AE-VQE: Neural network parameter prediction on autoencoded variational quantum eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding computational challenge is the accurate simulation of many-body particle systems. Especially for deriving key characteristics of high-impact but complex systems such as battery materials and high entropy alloys (HEA). While simple models allow for simulations of the required scale, these methods often fail to capture the complex dynamics that determine the characteristics. A long-theorized approach is to use quantum computers for this purpose, which allows for a more efficient encoding of quantum mechanical systems. In recent years, the field of quantum computing has become significantly more mature. Furthermore, the rise in integration of machine learning with quantum computing further pushes to a near-term advantage. In this work we aim to improve the well-established quantum computing method for calculating the inter-atomic potential, the variational quantum eigensolver, by presenting an auto-encoded VQE with neural-network predictions: NN-AE-VQE. We apply a quantum autoencoder for a compressed quantum state representation of the atomic system, to which a naive circuit ansatz is applied. This reduces the number of circuit parameters to optimize, while still minimal reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we train a classical neural network to predict the circuit parameters to avoid computationally expensive parameter optimization. We demonstrate these methods on a $H_2$ molecule, achieving chemical accuracy. We believe this method shows promise of efficiently capturing highly accurate systems while omitting current bottlenecks of variational quantum algorithms. Finally, we explore options for exploiting the algorithm structure and further algorithm improvements.</description>

      <title>Cooperative engineering the multiple radio-frequency fields to reduce the X-junction barrier for ion trap chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing number of ion qubits and improving performance of sophisticated quantum algorithms, more and more scalable complex ion trap electrodes have been developed and integrated. Nonlinear ion shuttling operations at the junction are more frequently used, such as in the areas of separation, merging, and exchanging. Several studies have been conducted to optimize the geometries of the radio-frequency (RF) electrodes to generate ideal trapping electric fields with a lower junction barrier and an even ion height of the RF saddle points. However, this iteration is time-consuming and commonly accompanied by complicated and sharp electrode geometry. Therefore, high-accuracy fabrication process and high electric breakdown voltage are essential. In the current work, an effective method was proposed to reduce the junction's pseudo-potential barrier and ion height variation by setting several individual RF electrodes and adjusting each RF voltage amplitude without changing the geometry of the electrode structure. The simulation results show that this method shows the same effect on engineering the trapping potential and reducing the potential barrier, but requires fewer parameters and optimization time. By combining this method with the geometrical shape-optimizing, the pseudo-potential barrier and the ion height variation near the junction can be further reduced. In addition, the geometry of the electrodes can be simplified to relax the fabrication precision and keep the ability to engineer the trapping electric field in real-time even after the fabrication of the electrodes, which provides a potential all-electric degree of freedom for the design and control of the two-dimensional ion crystals and investigation of their phase transition.</description>

      <title>Deterministic multi-phonon entanglement between two mechanical resonators on separate substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical systems have emerged as a compelling platform for applications in quantum information, leveraging recent advances in the control of phonons, the quanta of mechanical vibrations. Several experiments have demonstrated control and measurement of phonon states in mechanical resonators integrated with superconducting qubits, and while entanglement of two mechanical resonators has been demonstrated in some approaches, a full exploitation of the bosonic nature of phonons, such as multi-phonon entanglement, remains a challenge. Here, we describe a modular platform capable of rapid multi-phonon entanglement generation and subsequent tomographic analysis, using two surface acoustic wave resonators on separate substrates, each connected to a superconducting qubit. We generate a mechanical Bell state between the two mechanical resonators, achieving a fidelity of $\mathcal{F} = 0.872\pm 0.002$, and further demonstrate the creation of a multi-phonon entangled state (N=2 N00N state), shared between the two resonators, with fidelity $\mathcal{F} = 0.748\pm 0.008$. This approach promises the generation and manipulation of more complex phonon states, with potential future applications in bosonic quantum computing in mechanical systems. The compactness, modularity, and scalability of our platform further promises advances in both fundamental science and advanced quantum protocols, including quantum random access memory and quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Security of practical modulator-free quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum key distribution have led to the development of various modulator-free transmitters. Among their advantages, these transmitters offer enhanced security against Trojan-horse attacks. However, practical implementations emit residual pulses that, while not used in the quantum communication, still carry information about Alice's settings. While the intensity of these pulses can be attenuated with an intensity modulator, the extinction ratio of these devices is always finite, and therefore it remains crucial to account for the residual information leakage at the security-proof level. In this work, we analyze the security of these transmitters and evaluate their performance. We find that the secret-key rate of the protocol is severely affected when the information leakage is not sufficiently attenuated, which highlights the importance of accounting for such type of imperfections.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Enhancing Entanglement for Two-Photon-Driven Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control scheme is proposed that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance entanglement by modulating the two-photon-driven amplitude in a Rabi model. The quantum phase diagram versus the amplitude of the two-photon process and the coupling between the cavity field and the atom in the Rabi model, is indicated by the energy spectrum of the hybrid system, the witness of entanglement, second order correlation, and negativity of Wigner function. From a dynamical perspective, the behavior of entanglement can reflect the phase transition and the reinforcement learning agent is employed to produce temporal sequences of control pulses to enhance the entanglement in the presence of dissipation. The entanglement can be enhanced in different parameter regimes and the control scheme exhibits robustness against dissipation. The replaceability of the controlled system and the reinforcement learning module demonstrates the generalization of this scheme. This research paves the way of positively enhancing quantum resources in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Classifying Logical Gates in Quantum Codes via Cohomology Operations and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically construct and classify fault-tolerant logical gates implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum codes using cohomology operations and symmetry. These logical gates are obtained from unitary operators given by symmetry-protected topological responses, which correspond to generators of group cohomology and can be expressed explicitly on the lattice using cohomology operations including cup product, Steenrod squares and new combinations of higher cup products called higher Pontryagin powers. Our study covers most types of the cohomology operations in the literature. This hence gives rise to several new classes of diagonal and non-diagonal logical gates in increasing Clifford hierarchies beyond the usual color code paradigm corresponding to an $n$-fold cup product, including the logical $R_k$ and multi-controlled $C^m R_k$ gates for codes defined in projective spaces. Implementing these gates could make it more efficient to compile specific types of quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm. We further extend the construction to quantum codes with boundaries, which generalizes the folding approach in color codes. We also present a formalism for addressable and parallelizable logical gates in LDPC codes via higher-form symmetries and apply it to construct addressable logical Clifford gates in expander-based codes including the asymptotically good LDPC codes and hypergraph-product codes. As a byproduct, we find new topological responses of finite higher-form symmetries using higher Pontryagin powers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature-inspired field of quantum communication has witnessed exciting developments over the past few years with countries all over the world working hard to scale their experimental quantum networks to larger sizes and increased coverage. Evidently, quantum network simulators are the need of the hour as they provide a framework for tuning hardware parameters, optimizing control protocols, and testing configurations of large and complex quantum networks before their deployment in the real world. In this work, we present ShaNQar (Simulator of Network Quantique): a modular and customizable photonic quantum network simulator. It comprises models of components such as photons, lasers, neutral density filters, sources of entangled photon pairs, communication channels, mirrors, waveplates, beam splitters, single photon detectors, and nodes which incorporate a diverse set of tunable parameters for variability and versatility. It enables adaptive timing control and synchronization with virtually no simulation time resolution limit and features a 'plug and play' design for faster coding and efficient execution. We successfully simulated previous real-life experimental setups for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and quantum teleportation, thereby, demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of ShaNQar.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Open Quantum Dynamics Simulations Using Neural Network-Based Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-Markovian Stochastic Schrodinger Equation (NMSSE) offers a promising approach for open quantum simulations, especially in large systems, owing to its low scaling complexity and suitability for parallel computing. However, its application at low temperatures faces significant convergence challenges. While short-time evolution converges quickly, long-time evolution requires a much larger number of stochastic trajectories, leading to high computational costs. To this end,we propose a scheme that combines neural network techniques with simulations of the non-Markovian stochastic Schrodinger equation. By integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs),along with the iterative attentional feature fusion (iAFF) technique, this approach significantly reduces the number of trajectories required for long-time simulations, particularly at low temperatures, thereby substantially lowering computational costs and improving convergence. To demonstrate our approach, we investigated the dynamics of the spin-boson model and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex across a range of parameter variations.</description>

      <title>The composition rule for quantum systems is not the only possible one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory provides a significant example of two intermingling hallmarks of science: the ability to consistently combine physical systems and study them compositely; and the power to extract predictions in the form of correlations. A striking consequence of this facet is the violation of $\textit{local realism}$, which has been experimentally demonstrated via so-called $\textit{Bell tests}$. The prediction of this phenomenon originates as quantum systems are prescribed to combine according to the $\textit{composition postulate}$, i.e. the tensor-product rule. This rule has also an operationally sound formulation -- rather than just a purely mathematical one -- given in terms of discriminability of states via local measurements. Yet, both the theoretical and the empirical status of such postulate has been constantly challenged over the decades: is it possible to deduce it from the remaining postulates? Here, we solve this long-standing problem by answering in the negative. We formulate a family of operational theories that are solely distinguished from quantum theory by their system-composition rule, while, at the same time, they cannot be told apart by Bell-like experiments. Quantum theory is thus established to genuinely embody more content than quantum correlations. As a result, foundational programs only based on single-system principles, or on bare correlations, are operationally incomplete. On the experimental side, ascertaining the independence of postulates is a fundamental step to adjudicate between quantum theory and alternative physical theories: hence, the composition postulate deserves to be experimentally scrutinised independently of the other features of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Diffusion Models with Pairwise Bell State Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel quantum diffusion model designed for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Unlike previous methods, this model efficiently processes higher-dimensional images with complex pixel structures, even on qubit-limited platforms. This is accomplished through a pairwise Bell-state entangling technique, which reduces space complexity. Additionally, parameterized quantum circuits enable the generation of quantum states with minimal parameters, while still delivering high performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments, comparing the proposed model with both classical and quantum techniques using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results show significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance metrics such as FID, SSIM and PSNR. By leveraging quantum entanglement and superposition, this approach advances quantum generative learning. This advancement paves the way for more sophisticated and resource-efficient quantum diffusion algorithms capable of handling complex data on the NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Quantum Harmonic Otto Engine Under Hot Squeezed Thermal Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16115v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantum harmonic Otto engine under a hot squeezed thermal reservoir with asymmetry between the two adiabatic branches introduced by considering different speeds of the driving protocols. In the first configuration, the driving protocol for the expansion stroke is sudden-switch in nature and compression stroke is driven adiabatically, while the second configuration deals with the converse situation. In both cases, we obtain analytic expressions for the upper bound on efficiency and efficiency at optimal work output, which reveals a significant difference between the two configurations. Additionally, we find that the maximum achievable efficiency in sudden expansion case is 1/2 only while it approaches unity for the sudden compression stroke. Further, we study the effect of increasing degree of squeezing on the efficiency and work output of the engine and indicate the optimal operational regime for both configurations under consideration. Finally, by studying the full phase-diagram of the Otto cycle we observe that the operational region of the engine mode grows with increasing squeezing at the expense of refrigeration regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of quantum computing, the emergence of quantum computers and subsequent advancements have led to the development of various quantum algorithms capable of solving linear equations and eigenvalues, surpassing the pace of classical computers. Notably, the hybrid solver provided by the D-wave system can leverage up to two million variables. By exploiting this technology, quantum optimization models based on quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) have been proposed for applications, such as linear systems, eigenvalue problems, RSA cryptosystems, and CT image reconstruction. The formulation of QUBO typically involves straightforward arithmetic operations, presenting significant potential for future advancements as quantum computers continue to evolve. A prevalent approach in these developments is the binarization of variables and their mapping to multiple qubits. These methods increase the required number of qubits as the range and precision of each variable increase. Determining the optimal value of a QUBO model becomes more challenging as the number of qubits increases. Furthermore, the accuracies of the existing Qiskit simulator, D-Wave system simulator, and hybrid solver are limited to two decimal places. Problems arise because the qubits yielding the optimal value for the QUBO model may not necessarily correspond to the solution of a given problem. To address these issues, we propose a new iterative algorithm. The novel algorithm sequentially progresses from the highest to the lowest exponent in binarizing each number, whereby each number is calculated using two variables, and the accuracy can be computed up to a maximum of 16 decimal places.</description>

      <title>A Dequantized Algorithm for the Guided Local Hamiltonian Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16163v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local Hamiltonian (LH) problem, the quantum analog of the classical constraint satisfaction problem, is a cornerstone of quantum computation and complexity theory. It is known to be QMA-complete, indicating that it is challenging even for quantum computers. Interestingly, the guided local Hamiltonian (GLH) problem -- an LH problem with a guiding state that has a non-trivial overlap with the ground state -- can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer and is proved to be BQP-complete. This makes the GLH problem a valuable framework for exploring the fundamental separation between classical and quantum computation. Remarkably, the quantum algorithm for solving the GLH problem can be `dequantized' (i.e., made classically simulatable) under certain conditions, such as when only constant accuracy is required and when the Hamiltonian satisfies an unrealistic constant operator norm constraint. In this work, we relieve these restrictions by introducing a dequantized classical algorithm for a randomized quantum imaginary-time evolution quantum algorithm. We demonstrate that it achieves either limited or arbitrary constant accuracy, depending on whether the guiding state's overlap is general or exceeds a certain threshold. Crucially, our approach eliminates the constant operator norm constraint on the Hamiltonian, opening its applicability to realistic problems. Our results advance the classical solution of the GLH problem in practical settings and provide new insights into the boundary between classical and quantum computational power.</description>

      <title>Soft information decoding with superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction promises a viable path to fault-tolerant computations, enabling exponential error suppression when the device's error rates remain below the protocol's threshold. This threshold, however, strongly depends on the classical method used to decode the syndrome measurements. These classical algorithms traditionally only interpret binary data, ignoring valuable information contained in the complete analog measurement data. In this work, we leverage this richer "soft information" to decode repetition code experiments implemented on superconducting hardware. We find that "soft decoding" can raise the threshold by 25%, yielding up to 30 times lower error rates. Analyzing the trade-off between information volume and decoding performance we show that a single byte of information per measurement suffices to reach optimal decoding. This underscores the effectiveness and practicality of soft decoding on hardware, including in time-sensitive contexts such as real-time decoding.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free algorithms for solving nonlinear differential equations on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From weather to neural networks, modeling is not only useful for understanding various phenomena, but also has a wide range of potential applications. Although nonlinear differential equations are extremely useful tools in modeling, their solutions are difficult to obtain. Based on the expectation of quantum transcendence, quantum algorithms for efficiently solving nonlinear differential equations continue to be developed. However, even the latest promising algorithms have been pointed out to have an evolution time limit. This limit is the theoretically predestined divergence of solutions. We propose algorithms of divergence-free simulation for nonlinear differential equations in quantum computers. For Hamiltonian simulations, a pivot state $\bf{s}$ in the neighborhood of state $\bf{x}$ is introduced. Divergence of the solutions is prevented by moving $\bf{s}$ to a neighborhood of $\bf{x}$ whenever $\bf{x}$ leaves the neighborhood of $\bf{s}$. Since updating $\bf{s}$ is directly related to computational cost, to minimize the number of updates, the nonlinear differential equations are approximated by nonlinear polynomials around $\bf{s}$, which are then Carleman linearized. Hamiltonian simulations of nonlinear differential equations based on several representative models are performed to show that the proposed method breaks through the theoretical evolution time limit. The solution of nonlinear differential equations free from evolution time constraints opens the door to practical applications of quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relay Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication over a fully quantum relay channel is considered. We establish three bounds based on different coding strategies, i.e., partial decode-forward, measure-forward, and assist-forward. Using the partial-decode forward strategy, the relay decodes part of the information, while the other part is decoded without the relay's help. The result by Savov et al. (2012) for a classical-quantum relay channel is obtained as a special case. Based on our partial-decode forward bound, the capacity is determined for Hadamard relay channels. In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.</description>

      <title>Simulation of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy on a near-term quantum computer using a probe qubit protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes and long timescales involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on near-term quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e. simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relatively to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spetroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulphur bacteria.</description>

      <title>Postselected amplification applied to Mach-Zehnder-interferometer for phase shift measurement of optical coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a postselected amplification (PSA) scheme for phase shift measurement of optical coherent states when passing through the Mach-Zehnder-interferometer (MZI). Different from the usual weak-value-amplification (WVA) formulation, the which-path states of the MZI ($\left| 1 \right\rangle $ and $\left| 2 \right\rangle $) cannot be described as sub-system states entangled with the optical coherent states ($\left| 1 \right\rangle $ and $\left| 2 \right\rangle $) separated by the beam-splitter. However, we obtain the same result of the usual WVA in the Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman (AAV) limit, but beyond this limit, the result is different, e.g., the photon-number scaling can be different. We explicitly carry out the amplified phase shift, which is extracted out from the field-quadrature measurement in the dark port of the MZI. We also evaluate the performance quality of the proposed scheme, and analyze the technical advantages by considering possible errors in the quadrature measurement.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks-based Parameter Design towards Large-Scale Superconducting Quantum Circuits for Crosstalk Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To demonstrate supremacy of quantum computing, increasingly large-scale superconducting quantum computing chips are being designed and fabricated, sparking the demand for electronic design automation in pursuit of better efficiency and effectiveness. However, the complexity of simulating quantum systems poses a significant challenge to computer-aided design of quantum chips. Harnessing the scalability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we here propose a parameter designing algorithm for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. The algorithm depends on the so-called 'three-stair scaling' mechanism, which comprises two neural-network models: an evaluator supervisedly trained on small-scale circuits for applying to medium-scale circuits, and a designer unsupervisedly trained on medium-scale circuits for applying to large-scale ones. We demonstrate our algorithm in mitigating quantum crosstalk errors, which are commonly present and closely related to the graph structures and parameter assignments of superconducting quantum circuits. Parameters for both single- and two-qubit gates are considered simultaneously. Numerical results indicate that the well-trained designer achieves notable advantages not only in efficiency but also in effectiveness, especially for large-scale circuits. For example, in superconducting quantum circuits consisting of around 870 qubits, the trained designer requires only 27 seconds to complete the frequency designing task which necessitates 90 minutes for the traditional Snake algorithm. More importantly, the crosstalk errors using our algorithm are only 51% of those produced by the Snake algorithm. Overall, this study initially demonstrates the advantages of applying graph neural networks to design parameters in quantum processors, and provides insights for systems where large-scale numerical simulations are challenging in electronic design automation.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for quantum singular models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has seen substantial achievements, with numerical and theoretical evidence suggesting that singularities of statistical models are considered a contributing factor to its performance. From this remarkable success of classical statistical models, it is naturally expected that quantum singular models will play a vital role in many quantum statistical tasks. However, while the theory of quantum statistical models in regular cases has been established, theoretical understanding of quantum singular models is still limited. To investigate the statistical properties of quantum singular models, we focus on two prominent tasks in quantum statistical inference: quantum state estimation and model selection. In particular, we base our study on classical singular learning theory and seek to extend it within the framework of Bayesian quantum state estimation. To this end, we define quantum generalization and training loss functions and give their asymptotic expansions through algebraic geometrical methods. The key idea of the proof is the introduction of a quantum analog of the likelihood function using classical shadows. Consequently, we construct an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the quantum generalization loss, the quantum widely applicable information criterion (QWAIC), as a computable model selection metric from given measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek law in dissipative critical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative quench dynamics in a family of two-band fermionic systems on bipartite lattices ramped across their critical points, which is cast into the Lindblad formalism. First, we demonstrate an exact solution in the presence uniform loss or gain, which tells that the dissipation exponentially suppresses the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling law and the quantum jump part of the dissipation is responsible for an anti-KZ (AKZ) behavior. Then, in a scenario of engineered dissipation, we exemplify the effect of loss difference between the two sublattices of the system by three typical models. By the one-dimensional Rice-Mele model, we unravel a kind of dissipative KZ (DKZ) scaling law in the limit of loss difference and point out a convenient way to observe the DKZ behavior by counting the number of residual particles. Nevertheless, in the one-dimensional Shockley model, we find a nonuniversal scaling behavior irrelevant to the critical dynamics. Thus we explore several quench protocols so that these two scaling behaviors can appear together or separately. At last, we extend our findings to the two-dimensional Haldane model for Chern insulators consistently.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-fidelity spatial mode quantum gates in high-dimensional space by diffractive deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the spatial mode of photons is widely used in quantum cryptography, its potential for quantum computation remains largely unexplored. Here, we showcase the use of the multi-dimensional spatial mode of photons to construct a series of high-dimensional quantum gates, achieved through the use of diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs). Notably, our gates demonstrate high fidelity of up to 99.6(2)%, as characterized by quantum process tomography. Our experimental implementation of these gates involves a programmable array of phase layers in a compact and scalable device, capable of performing complex operations or even quantum circuits. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the D2NN gates by successfully implementing the Deutsch algorithm and propose an intelligent deployment protocol that involves self-configuration and self-optimization. Moreover, we conduct a comparative analysis of the D2NN gate's performance to the wave-front matching approach. Overall, our work opens a door for designing specific quantum gates using deep learning, with the potential for reliable execution of quantum computation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for high-dimensional nonlinear quantum computation that exploits tensor products of amplified vector and matrix encodings to efficiently evaluate multivariate polynomials. The approach enables the solution of nonlinear equations by quantum implementations of the fixed-point iteration and Newton's method, with quantitative runtime bounds derived in terms of the error tolerance. These results show that a quantum advantage, characterized by a logarithmic scaling of complexity with the dimension of the problem, is preserved. While Newton's method achieves near-optimal theoretical complexity, the fixed-point iteration already shows practical feasibility, as demonstrated by numerical experiments solving simple nonlinear problems on existing quantum devices. By bridging theoretical advances with practical implementation, the framework of amplified encodings offers a new path to nonlinear quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalence between absolutely separable (AS) states and absolutely positive partial transposed (APPT) states in general remains an open problem in quantum entanglement theory. In this work, we study an analogous question for symmetric multiqubit states. We show that SAPPT states (symmetric states that remain PPT after any symmetry-preserving unitary evolution) are not always symmetric absolutely separable (SAS) by providing explicit counterexamples. More precisely, we construct a family of entangled 5-qubit SAPPT states. Similar counterexamples for larger odd numbers of qubits are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to study the Bloch space of the qutrit system by examining the Bloch trajectories in it. Since such system is inherently a three-level quantum system, therefore we use the SU(3) group as the basis group to obtain the Bloch vectors of different configurations of it. The norm of the Bloch space is evaluated from the geometric consideration and also from the dynamics of the Bloch vectors and both results are found to be identical. The analysis of the dynamical evolution of the Bloch vectors reveals an additional feature that, under resonant conditions, the Bloch sphere $\mathbb{S}^{7}$ splits into two parts, a four-sphere $\mathbb{S}^{4}$ and a two-sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. The Bloch trajectories of the two sectors across different configurations exhibit a range of simple to complex curves, highlighting the non-trivial structure of the Bloch space of the qutrit system.</description>

      <title>Subsystem decompositions of quantum evolutions and transformations between causal perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One can theoretically conceive of processes where the causal order between quantum operations is no longer well-defined. Certain such causally indefinite processes have an operational interpretation in terms of quantum operations on time-delocalised subsystems -- that is, they can take place as part of standard quantum mechanical evolutions on quantum systems that are delocalised in time. In this paper, we formalise the underlying idea that quantum evolutions can be represented with respect to different subsystem decompositions in a general way. We introduce a description of quantum circuits, including cyclic ones, in terms of an operator acting on the global Hilbert space of all systems in the circuit. This allows us to express in a concise form how a given circuit transforms under arbitrary changes of subsystem decompositions. We then explore the link between this framework and the concept of causal perspectives, which has been introduced to describe causally indefinite processes from the point of view of the different parties involved. Surprisingly, we show that the causal perspectives that one can associate to the different parties in the quantum switch, a paradigmatic example of a causally indefinite process, cannot be related by a change of subsystem decomposition, i.e., they cannot be seen as two equivalent descriptions of the same process.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Quantum Phase Transition in Open Systems: System-Bath Interaction at the Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence of a second-order quantum phase transition in the Dicke model is a well-established feature. On the contrary, a comprehensive understanding of the corresponding open system, particularly in the proximity of the critical point, remains elusive. When approaching the critical point, the system inevitably enters first the system-bath ultrastrong coupling regime and finally the deepstrong coupling regime, causing the failure of usual approximations adopted to describe open quantum systems. We study the interaction of the Dicke model with bosonic bath fields in the absence of additional approximations, which usually relies on the weakness of the system-bath coupling. We find that the critical point is not affected by the interaction with the environment. Moreover, the interaction with the environment is not able to affect the system ground-state condensates in the superradiant phase, whereas the bath fields are infected by the system and acquire macroscopic occupations. The obtained reflection spectra display lineshapes which become increasingly asymmetric, both in the normal and superradiant phases, when approaching the critical point.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets and Schr\"{o}dinger's cat states in atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit realization of quantum droplets, even and odd Schr\"{o}dinger cat states is demonstrated in an atom-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of interconversion and Kerr non-linear interactions. The crucial roles of both the $\chi^2$-type nonlinearity and chemical potential in the formation of these macroscopic quantum states are shown, where the atomic condensate is in the cat state, with the corresponding molecular wave packet being a quantum droplet. The physical mechanism for their creation and common origin is established to be the non-linearity-induced self-trapping potentials, governed by photoassociation or Feshbach resonance, with the Kerr-type nonlinearities playing subdominant roles. The coexisting and controllable atom and molecular droplets are shown to realize the atom-molecular squeezed state with profiles ranging from Gaussian to flat-top super-Gaussian form. The Wigner functions are exhibited revealing the cat states' phase space interference and squeezing of droplets.</description>

      <title>Distributing Quantum Computations, Shot-wise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era constraints, high sensitivity to noise and limited qubit count, impose significant barriers on the usability of QPUs (Quantum Process Units) capabilities. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring methods to maximize the utility of existing QPUs despite their limitations. Building upon the idea that the execution of a quantum circuit's shots needs not to be treated as a singular monolithic unit, we propose a methodological framework, termed shot-wise, which enables the distribution of shots for a single circuit across multiple QPUs. Our framework features customizable policies to adapt to various scenarios. Additionally, it introduces a calibration method to pre-evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each QPU's output before the actual distribution process and an incremental execution mechanism for dynamically managing the shot allocation and policy updates. Such an approach enables flexible and fine-grained management of the distribution process, taking into account various user-defined constraints and (contrasting) objectives. Experimental findings show that while these strategies generally do not exceed the best individual QPU results, they maintain robustness and align closely with average outcomes. Overall, the shot-wise methodology improves result stability and often outperforms single QPU runs, offering a flexible approach to managing variability in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Single Photons from Pulsed Quantum Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-level system is the most fundamental building block of matter. Its response to classical light is well known, as it converts pulses of coherent light into antibunched emission. However, recent theoretical proposals have predicted that it is advantageous to illuminate two-level systems with quantum light; i.e., the light emitted from another quantum system. However, those proposals were done considering continuous excitation of the source of light. Here, we advance the field by changing the paradigm of excitation: we use the emission of a two-level system, itself driven by a laser pulse, to excite another two-level system. Thus, we present a thorough analysis of the response of a two-level system under pulsed quantum excitation. Our result maintain the claim of the advantage of the excitation with quantum light, while also supporting the recent experimental observations of our system, and can be used as a roadmap for the future of light-matter interaction research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Training with Growth-Based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces growth-based training strategies that incrementally increase parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) depth during training, mitigating overfitting and managing model complexity dynamically. We develop three distinct methods: Block Growth, Sequential Feature Map Growth, and Interleave Feature Map Growth, which add reuploader blocks to PQCs adaptively, expanding the accessible frequency spectrum of the model in response to training needs. This approach enables PQCs to achieve more stable convergence and generalization, even in noisy settings. We evaluate our methods on regression tasks and the 2D Laplace equation, demonstrating that dynamic growth methods outperform traditional, fixed-depth approaches, achieving lower final losses and reduced variance between runs. These findings underscore the potential of growth-based PQCs for quantum scientific machine learning (QSciML) applications, where balancing expressivity and stability is essential.</description>

      <title>Factoring integers via Schnorr's algorithm assisted with VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current asymmetric cryptography is based on the principle that while classical computers can efficiently multiply large integers, the inverse operation, factorization, is significantly more complex. For sufficiently large integers, this factorization process can take in classical computers hundreds or even thousands of years to complete. However, there exist some quantum algorithms that might be able to factor integers theoretically -- the theory works properly, but the hardware requirements are far away from what we can build nowadays -- and, for instance, Yan, B. et al. ([14]) claim to have constructed a hybrid algorithm which could be able even to challenge RSA-2048 in the near future. This work analyses this article and replicates the experiments they carried out, but with a different quantum method (VQE), being able to factor the number 1961.</description>

      <title>Weak measurement-based protocol for ergotropy protection in open quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are emerging as highly efficient energy storage devices that can exceed classical performance limits. Although there have been significant advancements in controlling these systems, challenges remain in stabilizing stored energy and minimizing losses due to inevitable environmental interaction. In this paper, we propose a protocol that employs selective weak measurements to protect quantum states from such influence and mitigate battery discharging. We establish thermodynamic constraints that allow this method to be implemented without disrupting the overall energy and ergotropy balance of the system. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately chosen measurement intensity can reduce unwanted discharging effects, thereby preserving ergotropy and improving the stability of quantum batteries. Additionally, we explore how weak measurements influence the coherent and incoherent components of ergotropy, providing new insights into the practical application of quantum coherence in energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Protomon: A Multimode Qubit in the Fluxonium Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits that are intrinsically insensitive to depolarization and dephasing errors promise to significantly reduce the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computing. At their optimal operating points, the logical states of these qubits exhibit both exponentially suppressed matrix elements and sweet spots in energy dispersion, rendering the qubits immune to depolarization and dephasing, respectively. We introduce a multimode qubit, the protomon, encoded in a fluxonium molecule circuit. Compared to the closely related $0$-$\pi$ qubit, the protomon offers several advantages in theory: resilience to circuit parameter disorder, minimal dephasing from intrinsic harmonic modes, and no dependence on static offset charge. As a proof of concept, we realize four protomon qubits. By tuning the qubits to various operating points identified with calibrated two-tone spectroscopy, we measure depolarization times ranging from 64 to 73 $\mu$s and dephasing times between 0.2 to 0.5 $\mu$s for one selected qubit. The discrepancy between the relatively short measured coherence times and theoretical predictions is not fully understood. This calls for future studies investigating the limiting noise factors, informing the direction for improving coherence times of the protomon qubit.</description>

      <title>Extension of Clifford Data Regression Methods for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenge posed by noise in real quantum devices, quantum error mitigation techniques play a crucial role. These techniques are resource-efficient, making them suitable for implementation in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, unlike the more resource-intensive quantum error correction codes. A notable example of such a technique is Clifford Data Regression, which employs a supervised learning approach. This work investigates two variants of this technique, both of which introduce a non-trivial set of gates into the original circuit. The first variant uses multiple copies of the original circuit, while the second adds a layer of single-qubit rotations. Different characteristics of these methods are analyzed theoretically, such as their complexity, or the scaling of the error with various parameters. Additionally, the performance of these methods is evaluated through numerical experiments, demonstrating a reduction in root mean square error.</description>

      <title>Implementing transferable annealing protocols for combinatorial optimisation on neutral atom quantum processors: a case study on smart-charging of electric vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16656v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quantum optimisation paradigm, variational quantum algorithms face challenges with hardware-specific and instance-dependent parameter tuning, which can lead to computational inefficiencies. However, the promising potential of parameter transferability across problem instances with similar local structures has been demonstrated in the context of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm. In this paper, we build on these advancements by extending the concept to annealing-based protocols, employing Bayesian optimisation to design robust quasi-adiabatic schedules. Our study reveals that, for Maximum Independent Set problems on graph families with shared geometries, optimal parameters naturally concentrate, enabling efficient transfer from smaller to larger instances. Experimental results on the Orion Alpha platform validate the effectiveness of our approach, scaling to problems with up to $100$ qubits. We apply this method to address a smart-charging optimisation problem on a real dataset. These findings highlight a scalable, resource-efficient path for hybrid optimisation strategies applicable in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>

      <title>String breaking mechanism in a lattice Schwinger model simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String breaking is a fundamental concept in gauge theories, describing the decay of a flux string connecting two charges through the production of particle-antiparticle pairs. This phenomenon is particularly important in particle physics, notably in Quantum Chromodynamics, and plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. However, achieving a theoretical understanding of this non-perturbative effect is challenging, as conventional numerical approaches often fall short and require substantial computational resources. On the experimental side, studying these effects necessitates advanced setups, such as high-energy colliders, which makes direct observation difficult. Here, we report an experimental investigation of the string breaking mechanism in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory using an optical lattice quantum simulator. By deterministically preparing initial states of varying lengths with fixed charges at each end, and adiabatically tuning the mass and string tension, we observed in situ microscopic confined phases that exhibit either string or brokenstring states. Further analysis reveals that string breaking occurs under a resonance condition, leading to the creation of new particle-antiparticle pairs. These findings offer compelling evidence of string breaking and provide valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of lattice gauge theories. Our work underscores the potential of optical lattices as controllable quantum simulators, enabling the exploration of complex gauge theories and their associated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Large tuning of the optical properties of nanoscale NdNiO3 via electron doping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesized crystalline films of neodymium nickel oxide (NdNiO3), a perovskite quantum material, switched the films from a metal phase (intrinsic) into an insulator phase (electron-doped) by field-driven lithium-ion intercalation, and characterized their structural and optical properties. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed that the intercalation process resulted in a gradient of the dopant concentration along the thickness direction of the films, turning the films into insulator-metal bilayers. We used variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure the complex refractive indices of the metallic and insulating phases of NdNiO3. The insulator phase has a refractive index of n ~ 2 and low absorption in the visible and near infrared, and analysis of the complex refractive indices indicated that the band gap of the insulating phase is roughly 3-4 eV. Electrical control of the optical band gap, with corresponding large changes to the optical refractive indices, creates new opportunities for tunable optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the nature of quantum fields in diverse spacetime backgrounds offers valuable insights for the fundamental comprehension of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here we introduce a novel method for mapping the massless Dirac equation in 1+1D curved spacetime to a controllable quantum simulation model, applicable to various observers' perspectives. We perform numerical simulations of Simpson spacetime and calculate tunneling rates in Painleve and Schwarzschild coordinates, which align closely with theoretical predictions of Hawking radiation. Additionally, we show the transition of Simpson spacetime from a regular black hole to a wormhole as the parameter $"a &gt; r_s"$. This method facilitates the study of spacetime from various coordinate perspectives (observers), providing deeper insights and understanding.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic tensor rank is characterized by polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic tensor rank is notoriously difficult to determine. Indeed, determining its value for the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor would determine the matrix multiplication exponent, a long-standing open problem. On the other hand, Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture makes the bold claim that asymptotic tensor rank equals the largest dimension of the tensor and is thus as easy to compute as matrix rank. Despite tremendous interest, much is still unknown about the structural and computational properties of asymptotic rank; for instance whether it is computable.
  We prove that asymptotic tensor rank is "computable from above", that is, for any real number $r$ there is an (efficient) algorithm that determines, given a tensor $T$, if the asymptotic tensor rank of $T$ is at most $r$. The algorithm has a simple structure; it consists of evaluating a finite list of polynomials on the tensor. Indeed, we prove that the sublevel sets of asymptotic rank are Zariski-closed (just like matrix rank). While we do not exhibit these polynomials explicitly, their mere existence has strong implications on the structure of asymptotic rank.
  As one such implication, we find that the values that asymptotic tensor rank takes, on all tensors, is a well-ordered set. In other words, any non-increasing sequence of asymptotic ranks stabilizes ("discreteness from above"). In particular, for the matrix multiplication exponent (which is an asymptotic rank) there is no sequence of exponents of bilinear maps that approximates it arbitrarily closely from above without being eventually constant. In other words, any upper bound on the matrix multiplication exponent that is close enough, will "snap" to it. Previously such discreteness results were only known for finite fields or for other tensor parameters (e.g., asymptotic slice rank). We obtain them for infinite fields like the complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Entropic uncertainty and quantum non-classicality of Unruh-Dewitt detectors in relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An object moving with the acceleration will change the temperature of environment around it, because of the presence of the Unruh thermal effect. In this work, we investigate the impact of Unruh thermal noise on the quantum-memory-assisted {entropic} uncertainty and quantum correlation regarding a pair of Unruh-Dewitt detectors. Specifically, we examine how the acceleration, the coupling strength between the external field and the detector, and the initial state affect the uncertainty and the system's quantum discord. It turns out that the Unruh effect will result in the loss of the systemic quantumness and inflation of the uncertainty. Moreover, it is revealed that the uncertainty is reversely correlated with the system's quantum discord. Thereby, it is believed that our investigations provide new insights into understanding the behavior of objects in the relativistic background.</description>

      <title>Charge-induced energy shift of a single-spin qubit under a magnetic-field gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electron confined by a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) can be displaced by changes in electron occupations of surrounding QDs owing to the Coulomb interaction. For a single-spin qubit in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, such a displacement of the host electron results in a qubit energy shift which must be handled carefully for high-fidelity operations. Here we spectroscopically investigate the qubit energy shift induced by changes in charge occupations of nearby QDs for a silicon single-spin qubit in a magnetic-field gradient. Between two different charge configurations of an adjacent double QD, a spin qubit shows an energy shift of about 4 MHz, which necessitates strict management of electron positions over a QD array. We confirm a correlation between the qubit frequency and the charge configuration by using a postselection analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intriguing phenomenon of beta decay of a free neutron in a non-plane-wave(structured) state. Our analysis covers three types of states: unpolarized vortex (Bessel) neutrons that possess nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets, and spin-correlated OAM (spin-orbit) states characterized by unique polarization patterns. These states are of particular interest as they have recently been generated in neutron optics experiments and have promising applications in studies of quantum magnetic materials. The spectral-angular distributions (SAD) of the emitted electrons and protons are examined. We show that the high sensitivity of the protons SAD to the structure of the neutron wave packet can be used as a tool to extract the distinctive features of the non-plane-wave neutron states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the angular distribution of the emitted particles serves as a reflection of the spatial symmetries inherent to the neutron wave packet.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a thermal machine based on a single closed quantum Hall edge channel forming a quantum dot. It is tunneling coupled with two quantum Hall states at $\nu=2$ kept at different temperatures, the hot one being also driven out-of-equilibrium by means of a periodic train of Lorentzian voltage pulses. This geometry is ideal to characterize the role played by the electron-electron interaction present within these channels on the efficiency of the machine. Here, it is possible to identify regions in the parameter space where the interaction leads to an improvement of the performances of the devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the parametric representation of a chaotic many-body
  quantum system derived earlier, we calculate explicitly the
  large-time dependence and asymptotic value of the out-of-time
  correlator (OTOC) of that system. The dependence on time $t$ is
  determined by $\Delta t / \hbar$. Here $\Delta$ is the energy
  correlation width within which the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit
  conjecture applies. We conjecture that $\Delta$ is universally
  related to the leading Ljapunov coefficient of the corresponding
  classical system by $\Delta = \hbar \lambda_{\max}$. Then the
  large-time behavior of OTOC is given by the dimensionless parameter
  $\lambda_{\max} t$.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Peierls state emerging from the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an important effect induced by the particle-lattice interaction, the Peierls transition, a hot topic in condensed matter physics, is usually believed to occur in the one-dimensional fermionic systems. We here study a bosonic version of the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice model, which describes itinerant bosons interact with the localized magnetic moments via only longitudinal Kondo exchange.\ We show that, by means of perturbation analysis and numerical density-matrix renormalization group method, a bosonic analog of the Peierls state can occur in proper parameters regimes. The Peierls state here is characterized by the formation of a long-range spin-density-wave order, the periodicity of which is set by the density of the itinerant bosons. The ground-state phase diagram is mapped out by extrapolating the finite-size results to thermodynamic limit. Apart from the bosonic Peierls state, we also reveal the presence of some other magnetic orders, including a paramagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic phase. We finally propose a possible experimental scheme with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Our results broaden the frontiers of the current understanding of the one-dimensional particle-lattice interaction system.</description>

      <title>Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison against quantum and classical Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor-network-based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via tensor-network contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the tensor network representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm, with the latter representing an emerging class of classical Ising solvers. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art tensor network approaches lead to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.</description>

Abstract: Fiber-based long-haul quantum communication would greatly benefit from a robust and deterministically integrated source of quantum state. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of InAs/InP quantum dots in the InP H1 point defect 2D photonic crystal cavity, integrated with the standard single-mode fiber using a micro-transfer printing technique. The device was placed in a compact cryocooler maintaining a cryogenic temperature of 15 K with single-photon emission characterized by $g^{(2)}(0)=0.14(14)$ and reliable and stable emission (intensity fluctuations given by a standard deviation $\sigma = 0.13$), so that an all-fiber based connection between two laboratory nodes through an open area was established and utilized for testing the quantum channel. In this way, we demonstrate a plug-and-play all-fiber single-photon source operating in the third telecom window, where standard telecommunication fiber networks can be used as a low-loss medium.</description>

      <title>Measuring entanglement without local addressing via spiral quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable measurements in various bases. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the "spin-spiral" structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, in various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.</description>

Abstract: In a quantum money scheme, a bank can issue money that users cannot counterfeit. Similar to bills of paper money, most quantum money schemes assign a unique serial number to each money state, thus potentially compromising the privacy of the users of quantum money. However in a quantum coins scheme, just like the traditional currency coin scheme, all the money states are exact copies of each other, providing a better level of privacy for the users. A quantum money scheme can be private, i.e., only the bank can verify the money states, or public, meaning anyone can verify. In this work, we propose a way to lift any private quantum coin scheme -- which is known to exist based on the existence of one-way functions, due to Ji, Liu, and Song (CRYPTO'18) -- to a scheme that closely resembles a public quantum coin scheme. Verification of a new coin is done by comparing it to the coins the user already possesses, by using a projector on to the symmetric subspace. No public coin scheme was known prior to this work. It is also the first construction that is very close to a public quantum money scheme and is provably secure based on standard assumptions. Finally, the lifting technique, when instantiated with the private quantum coins scheme~\cite{MS10}, gives rise to the first construction that is close to an inefficient unconditionally secure public quantum money scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy transfer and information transmission are two fundamental aspects of nature. They are seemingly unrelated, while recent findings suggest that a deep connection between them is to be discovered. This amounts to asking: Can we phrase the processes of transmitting classical bits equivalently as specific energy-transmitting tasks, thereby uncovering foundational links between them? We answer this question positively by showing that, for a broad class of classical communication tasks, a quantum dynamics' ability to transmit $n$ bits of classical information is equivalent to its ability to transmit $n$ units of energy in a thermodynamic task. This finding not only provides an analytical correspondence between information transmission and energy extraction tasks, but also quantifies classical communication by thermodynamics. Furthermore, our findings uncover the dynamical version of Landauer's principle, showing the strong link between transmitting information and energy. In the asymptotic regime, our results further provide thermodynamic meanings for the well-known Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem in quantum communication theory.</description>

Abstract: Phase estimation is one of the most important facets of quantum metrology, with applications in sensing, microscopy, and quantum computation. When estimating a phase shift in a lossy medium, there is an upper bound on the attainable information per particle sent through the phase shift. Previously, only entanglement-enhanced measurements have been shown to saturate this bound. We introduce a measurement scheme which can saturate the bound without relying on entanglement.</description>

      <title>Large-scale simulations of Floquet physics on near-term quantum computers</title>

Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems exhibit a diverse set of phenomena but are more challenging to simulate than their equilibrium counterparts. Here, we introduce the Quantum High-Frequency Floquet Simulation (QHiFFS) algorithm as a method to simulate fast-driven quantum systems on quantum hardware. Central to QHiFFS is the concept of a kick operator which transforms the system into a basis where the dynamics is governed by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. This allows prior methods for time-independent simulation to be lifted to simulate Floquet systems. We use the periodically driven biaxial next-nearest neighbor Ising (BNNNI) model, a natural test bed for quantum frustrated magnetism and criticality, as a case study to illustrate our algorithm. We implemented a 20-qubit simulation of the driven two-dimensional BNNNI model on Quantinuum's trapped ion quantum computer. Our error analysis shows that QHiFFS exhibits not only a cubic advantage in driving frequency $\omega$ but also a linear advantage in simulation time $t$ compared to~Trotterization.</description>

      <title>Heralded nonlocal quantum gates for distributed quantum computation in a decoherence-free subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a heralded protocol for implementing nontrivial quantum gates on two stationary qubits coupled to spatially separated cavities. By dynamically controlling the evolution of the composite system, nonlocal two-qubit quantum (e.g., CPHASE and CNOT) gates can be achieved without real excitations of either cavity modes or atoms. The success of our protocol is conditioned on projecting an auxiliary atom onto a postselected state, which simultaneously removes various detrimental effects of dissipation on the gate fidelity. In principle, the success probability of the gate can approach unity as the single-atom cooperativity becomes sufficiently large.Furthermore, we show its application for implementing single- and two-qubit gates within a decoherence-free subspace that is immune to a collective dephasing noise. This faithful, heralded, and nonlocal protocol could, therefore, be useful for distributed quantum computation and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero mode in a quantum computer from a duality twist</title>

Abstract: Investigating the interplay of dualities, generalized symmetries, and topological defects beyond theoretical models is an important challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum materials. A simple model exhibiting this physics is the transverse-field Ising model, which can host atopological defect that performs the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. When acting on one point in space, this duality defect imposes the duality twisted boundary condition and binds a single zero mode. This zero mode is unusual as it lacks a localized partner in the same $Z_2$ sector and has an infinite lifetime, even in finite systems. Using Floquet driving of a closed Ising chain with a duality defect, we generate this zero mode in a digital quantum computer. We detect the mode by measuring its associated persistent autocorrelation function using an efficient sampling protocol and a compound strategy for error mitigation. We also show that the zero mode resides at the domain wall between two regions related by a Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. Finally, we highlight the robustness of the isolated zero mode to integrability- and symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our findings provide a method for exploring exotic topological defects, associated with noninvertible generalized symmetries, in digitized quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Linear Spin-Wave Theory in a Non-Hermitian Quantum Spin Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the spin-wave theory of the excitation spectrum and quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising model. The complex excitation spectrum is obtained for a generic hypercubic lattice using the linear approximation of the Holstein-Primakoff transformation together with the complex bosonic Bogolyubov transformation. In the one-dimensional case, our result compares very well with the exact quasiparticle dispersion relation obtained via a fermionic representation of the problem, at least in the regime of large dissipation and transverse field. When applied to the quench dynamics we show however that the linear spin-wave approximation breaks down and the bosonic theory is plagued by a divergence at finite times. We understand the origin of this instability using a single mode approximation. While limited to short times, we show that this approach allows us to characterize the dynamics arising from the quench of the dissipative term and the structure of the Lieb-Robinson light-cone of the propagation quantum correlations. Furthermore, for the one-dimensional case, the linear spin-wave dynamics shows good agreement with the exact fermionic solution, both for the local magnetization and the spin-spin correlations.</description>

Abstract: Predicting observables in equilibrium states is a central yet notoriously hard question in quantum many-body systems. In the physically relevant thermodynamic limit, certain mathematical formulations of this task have even been shown to result in undecidable problems. Using a finite-size scaling of algorithms devised for finite systems often fails due to the lack of certified convergence bounds for this limit. In this work, we design certified algorithms for computing expectation values of observables in the equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians, both at zero and positive temperature. Importantly, our algorithms output rigorous lower and upper bounds on these values. This allows us to show that expectation values of local observables can be approximated in finite time, contrasting related undecidability results. When the Hamiltonian is commuting on a 2-dimensional lattice, we prove fast convergence of the hierarchy at high temperature and as a result for a desired precision $\varepsilon$, local observables can be approximated by a convex optimization program of quasi-polynomial size in $1/\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for calculating determinant and inverse of matrix and solving linear algebraic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose quantum algorithms for calculating the determinant and inverse of an $(N-1)\times (N-1)$ matrix (depth is $O(N^2\log N)$) which is a simple modification of the algorithm for calculating the determinant of an $N\times N$ matrix (depth is $O(N\log^2 N)$. The basic idea is to encode each row of the matrix into a pure state of some quantum system. In addition, we use the representation of the elements of the inverse matrix in terms of algebraic complements. Combination of this algorithm with the quantum algorithm for matrix multiplication, proposed in our previous work, yields the algorithm for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (depth is $O(N\log^2 N)$. Measurement of the ancilla state with output 1 (probability is $\sim 2^{-O(N\log N)}$) removes the garbage acquired during calculation. Appropriate circuits for all three algorithms are presented and have the same estimation $O(N\log N)$ for the size.</description>

      <title>Realization of High-Fidelity CZ Gate based on a Double-Transmon Coupler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Striving for higher gate fidelity is crucial not only for enhancing existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices but also for unleashing the potential of fault-tolerant quantum computation through quantum error correction. A recently proposed theoretical scheme, the double-transmon coupler (DTC), aims to achieve both suppressed residual interaction and a fast high-fidelity two-qubit gate simultaneously, particularly for highly detuned qubits. Harnessing the state-of-the-art fabrication techniques and a model-free pulse-optimization process based on reinforcement learning, we translate the theoretical DTC scheme into reality, attaining fidelities of 99.90% for a CZ gate and 99.98% for single-qubit gates. The performance of the DTC scheme demonstrates its potential as a competitive building block for superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Uniformly Decaying Subspaces for Error Mitigated Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general condition to obtain subspaces that decay uniformly in a system governed by the Lindblad master equation and use them to perform error mitigated quantum computation. The expectation values of dynamics encoded in such subspaces are unbiased estimators of noise-free expectation values. In analogy to the decoherence free subspaces which are left invariant by the action of Lindblad operators, we show that the uniformly decaying subspaces are left invariant (up to orthogonal terms) by the action of the dissipative part of the Lindblad equation. We apply our theory to a system of qubits and qudits undergoing relaxation with varying decay rates and show that such subspaces can be used to eliminate bias up to first order variations in the decay rates without requiring full knowledge of noise. Since such a bias cannot be corrected through standard symmetry verification, our method can improve error mitigation in dual-rail qubits and given partial knowledge of noise, can perform better than probabilistic error cancellation.</description>

Abstract: M\"ossbauer nuclei constitute exceptionally clean quantum-optical systems with transitions in the hard x-ray energy range, which, placed in x-ray waveguides, are a uniquely capable platform to study collective radiative effects in waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this work, we design and demonstrate the so-far unexplored nuclear resonant x-ray propagation in thin-film waveguides coupled in forward incidence, resolving excitation and collective evolution of M\"ossbauer nuclei in both time and position. To describe the effects of geometry on propagation and collective evolution, we present a unifying theoretical model. Our findings not only open up a new design space for experiments in nuclear resonant scattering and nuclear quantum optics, but also demonstrate a nanometer-sized x-ray source with extreme temporal and spatial coherence. %which previously were limited to either unstructured foil samples or translation-invariant reflectivity and diffraction configurations. This gives access to a new regime of waveguide QED with hard x-rays and furthermore paves a new route to coherent spectro-microscopic investigations at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: Measurements are interactions that accurately copy information with respect to a measurement basis, but establishing objective facts also requires redundancy. We therefore study unitary distribution of this information to multiple memories. We show that the accuracy of this broadcasting process is limited by thermodynamic restrictions on preparing the memories: ideal broadcasting is impossible using finite resources. We put forward a lower bound on the entropy production of such processes, demonstrating that the memory entropy limits the ability to accurately broadcast information.</description>

      <title>Three perspectives on entropy dynamics in a non-Hermitian two-state system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comparative study of entropy dynamics as an indicator of physical behavior in an open two-state system with balanced gain and loss is presented. We distinguish the perspective taken in utilizing the conventional framework of Hermitian-adjoint states from an approach that is based on biorthogonal-adjoint states and a third case based on an isospectral mapping. In this it is demonstrated that their differences are rooted in the treatment of the environmental coupling mode. For unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the system, a notable characteristic feature of the perspective taken is the presence or absence of purity oscillations, with an associated entropy revival. The description of the system is then continued from its $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric pseudo-Hermitian phase into the regime of spontaneously broken symmetry, in the latter two approaches through a non-analytic operator-based continuation, yielding a Lindblad master equation based on the $\mathcal{PT}$ charge operator $\mathcal{C}$. This phase transition indicates a general connection between the pseudo-Hermitian closed-system and the Lindbladian open-system formalism through a spontaneous breakdown of the underlying physical reflection symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of the Caldeira-Leggett model with non-equilibrium Gaussian reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a non-equilibrium version of the Caldeira-Leggett model in which a quantum particle is strongly coupled to a set of engineered reservoirs. The reservoirs are composed by collections of squeezed and displaced thermal modes, in contrast to the standard case in which the modes are assumed to be at equilibrium. The model proves to be very versatile. Strongly displaced/squeezed reservoirs can be used to generate an effective time dependence in the system Hamiltonian and can be identified as sources of pure work. In the case of squeezing, the time dependence is stochastic and breaks the fluctuation-dissipation relation, this can be reconciled with the second law of thermodynamics by correctly accounting for the energy used to generate the initial non-equilibrium conditions. To go beyond the average description and compute the full heat statistics, we treat squeezing and displacement as generalized Hamiltonians on a modified Keldysh contour. As an application of this technique, we show the quantum-classical correspondence between the heat statistics in the non-equilibrium Caldeira-Leggett model and the statistics of a classical Langevin particle under the action of squeezed and displaced colored noises. Finally, we discuss thermodynamic symmetries of the heat generating function, proving a fluctuation theorem for the energy balance and showing that the conservation of energy at the trajectory level emerges in the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Time-of-arrival distributions for continuous quantum systems and application to quantum backflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using standard results from statistics, we show that for any continuous quantum system (Gaussian or otherwise) and any observable $\widehat{A}$ (position or otherwise), the distribution $\pi_{a}\left(t\right)$ of time measurement at a fixed state $a$ can be inferred from the distribution $\rho_{t}\left( a\right)$ of a state measurement at a fixed time $t$ via the transformation $\pi_{a}(t) \propto \left\vert \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \int_{-\infty }^a \rho_t(u) du \right\vert$. This finding suggests that the answer to the long-lasting time-of-arrival problem is in fact secretly hidden within the Born rule, and therefore does not require the introduction of a time operator or a commitment to a specific (e.g., Bohmian) ontology. The generality and versatility of the result are illustrated by applications to the time-of-arrival at a given location for a free particle in a superposed state and to the time required to reach a given velocity for a free-falling quantum particle. Our approach also offers a potentially promising new avenue toward the design of an experimental protocol for the yet-to-be-performed observation of the phenomenon of quantum backflow.</description>

Abstract: This work studies the learnability of quantum circuits in the near term. We show the natural robustness of quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes and provide an efficient way to benchmark global depolarizing noise from statistics, which gives us a powerful framework for developing noise-tolerant algorithms. We adapt a learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits to the quantum statistical query setting with a small overhead in the query complexity. We prove average-case lower bounds for learning random quantum circuits of logarithmic and higher depths within diamond distance with statistical queries. Finally, we prove that pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) cannot be constructed using circuits of constant depth by constructing an efficient distinguisher and proving a new variation of the quantum no-free lunch theorem.</description>

Abstract: We propose to embed the atomic magnetometer (AM) into an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). We analyze the effect of amplification of the Faraday rotation (FR) angle of the probe laser light, by properly postselecting the path-information state of the laser photons when passing through the MZI. In the presence of saturation of photo-detectors and existence of polarization cross talk in the polarizing-beam-splitter performance, the amplified FR angle in the postselected photons makes the scheme be able to outperform the conventional measurement (without postselection), being thus further enhancing the sensitivity of the nowadays state-of-the-art optical AM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14526v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the formation of Schrodinger cat-like states (SCLSs) during the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process when the pump mode is considered quantum and depleted. For the first time, we show the formation of SCLSs in the fundamental and second harmonic modes under non-dissipative and dissipative regimes. The Wigner function is used to visualize qualitatively SCLSs. We have performed quantitative analysis of SCLSs by calculating values of the mean number of photon, photon number distribution, the variance of quadrature component, the Fano factor and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Phonon Number Measurement Using Optimal Composite Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the phonon number of the laser-cooled ions is an indispensable step in evaluating whether an ion is in ground state. At present, commonly used methods in the experiments are red-to-blue sideband ratios and adiabatic evolution red-sideband methods. We theoretically propose a method using composite pulses which does not need a fit of state evolution and can directly measure the population of the selected Fock state. It can measure higher Fock state population more directly comparing with the adiabatic evolution red-sideband method. We use quantum optimal control method to improve the fidelity of unitary operation of the composite pulses. With quantum optimal control technology, we can discuss the situation where the laser strength is strong, and many approximations will not be necessary, where the gate fidelity can be further improved. Then we give a method to modify the measurement result for a higher accuracy which has a good performance, and we give an example to illustrate its application on high Fock state measurement.</description>

      <title>Robustness of contextuality under different types of noise as quantifiers for parity-oblivious multiplexing tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalised contextuality is the notion of nonclassicality powering up a myriad of quantum tasks, among which is the celebrated case of a two-party information processing task where classical information is compressed in a quantum channel, the parity-oblivious multiplexing (POM) task. The success rate is the standard quantifier of resourcefulness for this task, while robustness-based quantifiers are as operationally motivated and have known general properties. In this work, we leverage analytical and numerical tools to estimate robustness of contextuality in POM scenarios under different types of noise. We conclude that for the 3-to-1 case robustness of contextuality to depolarisation, as well as a minimisation of robustness of contextuality to dephasing over all bases, are good quantifiers for the nonclassical advantage of this scenario. Moreover, we obtain a general relation between robustness of contextuality to depolarisation and the success rate in any $n$-to-1 POM scenario and show how it can be used to bound the number of bits encoded in this task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin noise spectroscopy (SNS) has become a mainstream approach to probe the dynamics of a spin ensemble in and out of equilibrium. Current models describing spin noise in interacting samples are based on an effective single particle dynamics in a bath. Here, we report the observation of a strong interaction regime which significantly affects the spin dynamics. Performing SNS in a dense Rubidium vapor, we observe anomalous distortions of the usual spin noise spectra, which we attribute to resonant dipole-dipole interaction within the ensemble. As the density of the vapor increases, we observe a dramatic broadening of the usual resonances and the emergence of an unexpected extra low-frequency noise component. We use a simple microscopic two-body numerical model to reproduce and discuss these observations. Our results suggests that the spectra cannot be described by usual models of single-atom dynamics and arise from the evolution of interacting pair of atoms. This work opens the way to the study of many-body spin noise or higher order correlators in atomic vapors using SNS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems is a major problem in quantum matter. Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open challenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and tensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by computing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient magnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that our method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the reduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by exploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics, elucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body interactions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body Liouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum information scrambling in adiabatically-driven critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling refers to the spread of the initially stored information over many degrees of freedom of a quantum many-body system. Information scrambling is intimately linked to the thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems, and has been typically studied in a sudden quench scenario. Here, we extend the notion of quantum information scrambling to critical quantum many-body systems undergoing an adiabatic evolution. In particular, we analyze how the symmetry-breaking information of an initial state is scrambled in adiabatically driven integrable systems, such as the Lipkin--Meshkov--Glick and quantum Rabi models. Following a time-dependent protocol that drives the system from symmetry-breaking to a normal phase, we show how the initial information is scrambled, even for perfect adiabatic evolutions, as indicated by the expectation value of a suitable observable. We detail the underlying mechanism for quantum information scrambling, its relation to ground- and excited-state quantum phase transitions, and quantify the degree of scrambling in terms of the number of eigenstates that participate in the encoding of the initial symmetry-breaking information. While the energy of the final state remains unaltered in an adiabatic protocol, the relative phases among eigenstates are scrambled, and so is the symmetry-breaking information. We show that a potential information retrieval, following a time-reversed protocol, is hindered by small perturbations, as indicated by a vanishingly small Loschmidt echo and out-of-time-ordered correlators. The reported phenomenon is amenable for its experimental verification, and may help in the understanding of information scrambling in critical quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic state preparation aims to prepare the ground state of a target Hamiltonian starting from the easily prepared ground state of an initial Hamiltonian. While effective for time-dependent Hamiltonians with a significant energy gap to the first coupled excited state, this process becomes exceedingly slow as the gap becomes small. To accelerate it, we allow controlled diabatic excitations during the evolution and optimize the path to remove those excitations at the end of the evolution. This is done via a modulated time evolution (dynamically scaling the Hamiltonian) in addition to a field similar to the one used in local adiabatic time evolution, with the target to optimize the final energy of the unscaled Hamiltonian. This method is easy to implement and requires no complex counter-diabatic Hamiltonians and no prior knowledge of the system's energy gap. When the time evolution is further Trotterized, separating the spin-spin coupling terms and the magnetic-field terms into distinct factors, it becomes identical in structure to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Compared to QAOA, the modulated time evolution often achieves the same level of performance with fewer layers (time steps).</description>

Abstract: We derive an exact canonical matrix product state (MPS) representation for Dicke states $|D^n_k\rangle$ with minimal bond dimension $\chi=k+1$, for general values of $n$ and $k$, for which the W-state is the simplest case $k=1$. We use this MPS to formulate a quantum circuit for sequentially preparing Dicke states deterministically, relating it to the recursive algorithm of B\"artschi and Eidenbenz. We also find exact canonical MPS representations with minimal bond dimension for higher-spin and qudit Dicke states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between sampling advice, i.e., advice in the form of a training set, and classical advice. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that BPP/samp is equal to P/poly. Additionally, we delve into the analysis of these relationships under the constraint of a fixed distribution. Notably, we show that under such circumstances, the equality does not hold. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from these proofs, we identify sufficient and necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up in the worst-case scenario, i.e., when accurate results are required for all inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework to study the dynamics of open quantum systems with linearly coupled Gaussian baths. Our approach replaces the continuous bath with an auxiliary discrete set of pseudomodes with dissipative dynamics, but we further relax the complete positivity requirement in the Lindblad master equation and formulate a quasi-Lindblad pseudomode theory. We show that this quasi-Lindblad pseudomode formulation directly leads to a representation of the bath correlation function in terms of a complex weighted sum of complex exponentials, an expansion that is known to be rapidly convergent in practice and thus leads to a compact set of pseudomodes. The pseudomode representation is not unique and can differ by a gauge choice. When the global dynamics can be simulated exactly, the system dynamics is unique and independent of the specific pseudomode representation. However, the gauge choice may affect the stability of the global dynamics, and we provide an analysis of why and when the global dynamics can retain stability despite losing positivity. We showcase the performance of this formulation across various spectral densities in both bosonic and fermionic problems, finding significant improvements over conventional pseudomode formulations.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of gravitational acceleration, or gravimetry, enable the testing of physical theories and find numerous applications in geodesy and space exploration. By harnessing quantum effects, high-precision sensors can achieve sensitivity and accuracy far beyond their classical counterparts when using the same number of sensing resources. Therefore, developing gravimeters with quantum-enhanced sensitivity is essential for advancing theoretical and applied physics. While novel quantum gravimeters have already been proposed for this purpose, the ultimate sensing precision, known as the Heisenberg limit, remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the gravimetry precision of a conditional displacement spin-mechanical system increases quadratically with the number of spins: a Heisenberg-limited spin-mechanical gravimeter. In general, the gravitational parameter is dynamically encoded into the entire entangled spin-mechanical probe. However, at some specific times, the mechanical degree of freedom disentangles from the spin subsystem, transferring all the information about the gravitational acceleration to the spin subsystem. Hence, we prove that a feasible spin magnetization measurement can reveal the ultimate gravimetry precision at such disentangling times. We predict an absolute gravimetry uncertainty of $10^{-11}\text{m/s}^2$ to $10^{-6}\text{m/s}^2$, without relying on free-fall methodologies, ground-state cooling of the mechanical object, and robust against spin-mechanical coupling anisotropies.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Classical Algorithm for Simulating Short Time 2D Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient classical simulation of the Schrodinger equation is central to quantum mechanics, as it is crucial for exploring complex natural phenomena and understanding the fundamental distinctions between classical and quantum computation. Although simulating general quantum dynamics is BQP-complete, tensor networks allow efficient simulation of short-time evolution in 1D systems. However, extending these methods to higher dimensions becomes significantly challenging when the area law is violated. In this work, we tackle this challenge by introducing an efficient classical algorithm for simulating short-time dynamics in 2D quantum systems, utilizing cluster expansion and shallow quantum circuit simulation. Our algorithm has wide-ranging applications, including an efficient dequantization method for estimating quantum eigenvalues and eigenstates, simulating superconducting quantum computers, dequantizing quantum variational algorithms, and simulating constant-gap adiabatic quantum evolution. Our results reveal the inherent simplicity in the complexity of short-time 2D quantum dynamics and highlight the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, particularly those confined to 2D topological structures. This work advances our understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation and the criteria for achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit polarization self-rotation in atomic rubidium vapor to observe spontaneous symmetry breaking and bistability of polarization patterns. We pump the vapor cell with horizontally polarized light while the vertical polarization, which is initially in the vacuum state, is resonated in a ring cavity. Vacuum fluctuations in this mode experience cumulative gain due to the compound action of amplification due to the self-rotation and feedback through the resonator, eventually acquiring a macroscopic magnitude akin to an optical parametric oscillator. The randomness of these fluctuations results in a bistable, random macroscopic polarization pattern at the output. We propose utilizing this mechanism to simulate Ising-like interaction between multiple spatial modes and as a basis for a fully optical coherent Ising machine.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gates are crucial for processing quantum information, but implementing them in a photonic platform poses unique challenges due to the peculiar way photons propagate and interfere. Here, we examine quantum photonic gates that utilize continuous time two-dimensional random walking photons. These gates can be implemented using the inverse design method, where photons randomly walk in a two-dimensional silicon host medium embedded with silicon dioxide scatterers. We propose a C-NOT gate as a multiqubit gate and an X-gate as a single qubit gate. In addition, we provide studying the non-trivial spatial correlations of random walking photons by utilizing the quantum correlation function. The results demonstrate high-fidelity probabilistic quantum gates. Further work is required to address error-correction. This work advances the practical implementation photonic elements in linear optics quantum computation schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Tomography of Photonic Qubits with Realistic Coherent Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for characterizing quantum states. However, practical implementations of QST are significantly challenged by factors such as shot noise, attenuation, and Raman scattering, especially when photonic qubits are transmitted through optical fibers alongside classical signals. In this paper, we present a numerical framework to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of QST under these realistic conditions. The results reveal how the efficiency of QST is influenced by the power of the classical signal. By analyzing the fidelity of reconstructed states, we provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements for QST in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical correlations in four-wave mixing from cold ensembles of two-level atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in four-wave-mixing from ensembles of cold two-level atoms may prevail without filtering over background light with well-known classical interpretations, such as Rayleigh scattering, as recently experimentally demonstrated in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 083601 (2022)]. Here we provide an extended investigation of this effect, in which we detail the experimental procedure and the variation of the quantum correlation with various parameters of the system. Particularly, we show that the decay rate of the quantum correlations changes with the number of atoms in the sample, providing another indication of its superradiance-like nature. The non-classical aspects of the signal occur for short timescales, but the long timescales carry as well a lot of information on the classical correlations of the system. This slow classical regime presents also two clearly distinct time scales, which we explain by two different pathways for the creation of biphotons. From the global analysis of the data in all its timescales, we are able to derive an empirical expression to fit the data, resulting in information on, among other parameters, the sample's temperature and superradiant-like acceleration. In general, the reported quantum correlations present a dependence on critical parameters of the system, such as optical depth and excitation power, that is quite different from other systems used for biphoton generation, and are more robust to changes in these parameters. This opens the possibility of exploring this process for efficient generation of narrowband biphotons or of other quantum-correlated photonic states of higher order.</description>

      <title>Assessing non-Gaussian quantum state conversion with the stellar rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State conversion is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. Quantum resource theories allow to analyze and bound conversions that use restricted sets of operations. In the context of continuous-variable systems, state conversions restricted to Gaussian operations are crucial for both fundamental and practical reasons -- particularly in state preparation and quantum computing with bosonic codes. However, previous analysis did not consider the relevant case of approximate state conversion. In this work, we introduce a framework for assessing approximate Gaussian state conversion by extending the stellar rank to the approximate stellar rank, which serves as an operational measure of non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds for Gaussian state conversion under both approximate and probabilistic conditions, yielding new no-go results for non-Gaussian state preparation and enabling a reliable assessment of the performance of generic Gaussian conversion protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time Travel Revisited: Noncommutative M\"{o}bius Transformations and Time Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of quantum time loops introduced by Greenberger and Svozil [1] from the scalar situation (where paths have just an associated complex amplitude) to the general situation where the time traveling system has multi-dimensional underlying Hilbert space. The main mathematical tool which emerges is the noncommutative Mobius Transformation and this affords a formalism similar to the modular structure well known to feedback control problems. The self-consistency issues that plague other approaches do not arise in this approach as we do not consider completely closed time loops. We argue that a sum-over-all-paths approach may be carried out in the scalar case, but quickly becomes unwieldy in the general case. It is natural to replace the beamsplitters of [1] with more general components having their own quantum structure, in which case the theory starts to resemble the quantum feedback networks theory for open quantum optical models and indeed we exploit this to look at more realistic physical models of time loops. We analyze some Grandfather paradoxes in the new setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Prometheus: Defying Overhead with Recycled Ancillas in Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of quantum computers. However, implementing QEC often requires a significant number of qubits, leading to substantial overhead. One of the major challenges in quantum computing is reducing this overhead, especially since QEC codes depend heavily on ancilla qubits for stabilizer measurements. In this work, we propose reducing the number of ancilla qubits by reusing the same ancilla qubits for both X- and Z-type stabilizers. This is achieved by alternating between X and Z stabilizer measurements during each half-round, cutting the number of required ancilla qubits in half. This technique can be applied broadly across various QEC codes, we focus on rotated surface codes only and achieve nearly \(25\%\) reduction in total qubit overhead. We also present a few use cases where the proposed idea enables the usage of higher-distance surface codes at a relatively lesser qubit count. Our analysis shows that the modified approach enables users to achieve similar or better error correction with fewer qubits, especially for higher distances (\(d \geq 13\)). Additionally, we identify conditions where the modified code allows for extended distances (\(d + k\)) while using the same or fewer resources as the original, offering a scalable and practical solution for quantum error correction. These findings emphasize the modified surface code's potential to optimize qubit usage in resource-constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>iHQGAN: A Lightweight Invertible Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Network for Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging quantum computing's intrinsic properties to enhance machine learning has shown promise, with quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) demonstrating benefits in data generation. However, the application of QGANs to complex unsupervised image-to-image (I2I) translation remains unexplored. Moreover, classical neural networks often suffer from large parameter spaces, posing challenges for GAN-based I2I methods. Inspired by the fact that unsupervised I2I translation is essentially an approximate reversible problem, we propose a lightweight invertible hybrid quantum-classical unsupervised I2I translation model - iHQGAN, by harnessing the invertibility of quantum computing. Specifically, iHQGAN employs two mutually approximately reversible quantum generators with shared parameters, effectively reducing the parameter scale. To ensure content consistency between generated and source images, each quantum generator is paired with an assisted classical neural network (ACNN), enforcing a unidirectional cycle consistency constraint between them. Simulation experiments were conducted on 19 sub-datasets across three tasks. Qualitative and quantitative assessments indicate that iHQGAN effectively performs unsupervised I2I translation with excellent generalization and can outperform classical methods that use low-complexity CNN-based generators. Additionally, iHQGAN, as with classical reversible methods, reduces the parameter scale of classical irreversible methods via a reversible mechanism. This study presents the first versatile quantum solution for unsupervised I2I translation, extending QGAN research to more complex image generation scenarios and offering a quantum approach to decrease the parameters of GAN-based unsupervised I2I translation methods.</description>

      <title>QMA vs. QCMA and Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a longstanding question of Aaronson and Kuperberg on whether there exists a classical oracle separating $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$. Settling this question in either direction would yield insight into the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs. We show that such an oracle exists if a certain quantum pseudorandomness conjecture holds. Roughly speaking, the conjecture posits that quantum algorithms cannot, by making few queries, distinguish between the uniform distribution over permutations versus permutations drawn from so-called "dense" distributions.
  Our result can be viewed as establishing a "win-win" scenario: either there is a classical oracle separation of $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$, or there is quantum advantage in distinguishing pseudorandom distributions on permutations.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Spin-Spin Interaction Mediated by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity and chirality are two fundamental properties known to give rise to various intriguing phenomena. However, the interplay between these properties has been rarely explored. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an off-diagonal non-Hermitian spin-spin interaction mediated by chiral phonons. This interaction arises from the spin-selectivity due to the locking between phonon momentum and angular momentum in chiral materials. The resulting non-Hermitian interaction mediated by the vacuum field of chiral phonons can reach the kHz range for electron spins and can be further enhanced by externally driven mechanical waves, potentially leading to observable effects in the quantum regime. Moreover, the long-range nature of phonon-mediated interactions enables the realization of the long-desired non-Hermitian interaction among multiple spins. The effect proposed in this work may have wide-ranging applications in cascaded quantum systems, non-Hermitian many-body physics, and non-Hermitian cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05492v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of Majorana bound states with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either phase and momentum relaxation or phase relaxation is present. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continued interest in placing bounds on the neutron's Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) is due to the implications regarding the characteristics of the strong interaction and, in particular, its behavior under the CP symmetry. In this work, we discuss the apparent tension resulting from the discrepancy of about 13 orders of magnitude between the current bounds and the expected quantum uncertainty in the relevant quantity. We offer a resolution of the "puzzle" in terms of the notion of a weak measurement, using a version of the corresponding formalism adapted to consideration of the nEDM experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Emerging topological characterization in non-equilibrium states of quenched Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a type of collinear magnetism, that is in some aspects distinct from ferromagnetism and from conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin-split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Non-Trivial Topology in a Superconducting Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general properties of physical systems. In condensed matter, nontrivial topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the quantization of electrical properties such as conductance and magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we determine that a superconducting circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess degeneracies indicative of \emph{intrinsic} nontrivial topology. We identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Measurements show that devices fabricated in different topological regimes fall on a simple phase diagram which should be robust to junction imperfections and geometric inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of topological systems that may have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may find use in quantum information, sensing, and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Exchange anisotropies in microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits are rapidly emerging as the workhorse of semiconducting quantum processors because of their large spin-orbit interaction, enabling fast all-electric operations at low power. However, spin-orbit interaction also causes non-uniformities in devices, resulting in locally varying qubit energies and site-dependent anisotropies. While these anisotropies can be used to drive single-spins, if not properly harnessed, they can hinder the path toward large-scale quantum processors. Here, we report on microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits in planar germanium and use them to investigate the anisotropy of two spins in a double quantum dot. We show two distinct operating regimes depending on the magnetic field direction. For in-plane fields, the two spins are largely anisotropic, and electrically tunable, which enables to measure all the available transitions; coherence times exceeding 3 $\mu$s are extracted. For out-of-plane fields, they have an isotropic response but preserve the substantial energy difference required to address the singlet-triplet qubit. Even in this field direction, where the qubit lifetime is strongly affected by nuclear spins, we find 400 ns coherence times. Our work adds a valuable tool to investigate and harness the anisotropy of spin qubits and can be implemented in any large-scale NxN device, facilitating the path towards scalable quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus Dissipation in a Non-Hermitian Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Optical Algorithm for Derivative of Real-Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The derivation of a function is a fundamental tool for solving problems in calculus. Consequently, the motivations for investigating physical systems capable of performing this task are numerous. Furthermore, the potential to develop an optical computer to replace conventional computers has led us to create an optical algorithm and propose an experimental setup for implementing the derivative of one-dimensional real-valued functions using a paraxial and monochromatic laser beam. To complement the differentiation algorithm, we have experimentally implemented a novel optical algorithm that can transfer a two-dimensional phase-encoded function to the intensity profile of a light beam. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement the n-th derivative of functions encoded in the phase of the transverse profile of photons.</description>

      <title>Engineering Ponderomotive Potential for Realizing $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ Bosonic Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a $\pi$-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to $\pi$-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized $\pi/2$-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the $\pi/2$-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Embedded structure in quantum theory, functional operator and multiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <title>Preparation and observation of anomalous counterpropagating edge states in a periodically driven optical Raman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of real-space edge modes with ultracold atoms [Braun et al., Nat. Phys. 20, 1306 (2024)], we investigate the preparation and detection of anomalous counterpropagating edge states -- a defining feature of the anomalous Floquet valley-Hall (AFVH) phase -- in a two-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice. Modeling the atomic cloud with a Gaussian wave packet state, we explore, both analytically and numerically, how the population of edge modes depends on the initial-state parameters. In particular, we reveal that, in addition to the internal spin state, the initial momenta parallel and perpendicular to the boundary play essential roles: they independently control the selective population of edge states across distinct momenta and within separate quasienergy gaps. Furthermore, we examine the wave-packet dynamics of counterpropagating edge states and demonstrate that their characteristic motion is robust against long-range disorder. These results establish a theoretical framework for future experimental explorations of the AFVH phase and topological phenomena associated with its unique edge modes.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>
