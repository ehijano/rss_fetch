      <title>A Markov Chain Arising from the Hopf Square Map on a Non-cocommutative Quantum Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding upon the rich history of algebraic techniques in probability, we show the existence of and construct a Markov chain using the Hopf square map on a quantum group that is both non-commutative and non-cocommutative. This extends the work of Diaconis, Pang, and Ram to other Hopf algebras. The new, one-dimensional chain requires different analytical approaches. In this case we use standard martingale theory to prove the existence of a phase transition and prove bounds on the expected growth rates.</description>

      <title>A Poisson-Alekseev-Gr\"obner formula through Malliavin calculus for Poisson random integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an Alekseev--Gr\"obner formula for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by a Poisson random measure, which express the global error between a functional of two processes solution of SDEs started at the same initial condition, in terms of the infinitesimal error (i.e, the difference between the SDEs coefficients). In particular, we consider the situation where the flow process is only assumed to be jointly stochastically continuous with respect to space and time. Our proof relies on a new approach for the definition of the Skorohod--Poisson integral to treat the anticipating term appearing in the formula, based on a definition of the Malliavin derivative on a class of smooth random variables, instead of the more standard polynomial chaos approach.</description>

      <title>Critical thresholds in stochastic rumors on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertices of a tree represent individuals in one of three states: ignorant, spreader, or stifler. A spreader transmits the rumor to any of its nearest ignorant neighbors at rate one. At the same rate, a spreader becomes a stifler after contacting nearest-neighbor spreaders or stiflers. The rumor survives if, at all times, there exists at least one spreader. We consider two extensions and prove phase transition results for rumor survival. First, we consider the infinite Cayley tree of coordination number $d+1$, with $d\geq 2$, and assume that as soon as an ignorant hears the rumor, the individual becomes spreader with probability $p$, or stifler with probability $1-p$. Using coupling with branching processes we prove that for any $d$ there is a phase transition in $p$ and localize the critical parameter. By refining this approach, we extend the study to an inhomogeneous tree with hubs of degree $d+1$ and other vertices of degree at most $k=o(d)$. The purpose of this extension is to illustrate the impact of the distance between hubs on the dissemination of rumors in a network. To this end, we assume that each hub is, on average, connected to $\alpha (d+1)$ hubs, with $\alpha\in (0,1]$, via paths of length $h$. We obtain a phase transition result in $\alpha$ in terms of $d,k,$ and $h$, and we show that in the case of $k=\Theta(\log d)$ phase transition occurs iff $h \lesssim \Theta( \log d / (\log \log d))$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis for a Class of Stochastic Copolymerization Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>

      <title>Multitype contact process with sterile states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a natural variant of the $d$-dimensional multitype contact process in which individuals can be fertile or sterile. Fertile individuals of type $i$ give birth to an offspring of their own type at rate $\lambda_i$, the offspring being fertile with probability $p_i$ and sterile with probability $1 - p_i$, whereas sterile individuals can't give birth. Offspring are sent to one of the neighbors of their parent's location and take place in the system if and only if the target site is empty. All the individuals die at rate one regardless of their type and regardless of whether they are fertile or sterile. Our main results show some qualitative disagreements between the spatial model and its nonspatial mean-field approximation that are more pronounced when the probability $p_i$ is small. More precisely, for the mean-field model, in the presence of only one type, survival occurs when $\lambda_i p_i &gt; 1$, and in the presence of two types, the type with the largest $\lambda_i p_i$ wins. In contrast, though the analysis of the spatial model shows a similar behavior when $p_i$ is close to one, in the presence of only one type, extinction always occurs when $p_i &lt; 1/4d$. Similarly, a type with $\lambda_i &gt; \lambda_c =$ critical value of the contact process and $p_i = 1$ is more competitive than a type with $\lambda_i$ arbitrarily large but $p_i &lt; 1/4d$, showing that the product $\lambda_i p_i$ no longer measures the competitiveness. These results underline the effects of space in the form of local interactions.</description>

      <title>The odometer in subcritical activated random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the activated random walk particle system, a model of self-organized criticality, on $\mathbb{Z}$ with i.i.d.-Bernoulli initial configuration. We show that at subcritical density, the system's odometer function, which counts the number of actions taken at each site, has a stretched exponential tail. It follows that the expected odometer at each site is finite.</description>

      <title>Emergence of metastability on the hyperbolic lattice: Effects of boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Ising model on finite subgraphs of the hyperbolic lattice under minus boundary conditions and in the presence of a positive external field $h$. Interpreting the boundary as frozen or cold wall conditions, we show that, for small values of $h$, the system exhibits metastable behaviour. Our result is very surprising, since non-amenable graphs, such as hyperbolic lattices, feature exponentially growing boundaries, which typically destabilize local energy minima. In particular, we identify the unique metastable state and characterize the exit time from it. Furthermore, we establish asymptotic results for the distribution of the first hitting time and provide estimates for the spectral gap. Finally, we analyze the energy landscape and describe the nucleation mechanism for values of $h$ outside the metastable regime.</description>

      <title>Hedging of exotic options in Hawkes jump-diffusion models by Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In financial mathematics, the calculation of the Greeks, especially the delta, is emphasized due to its role in risk management. In this article, we employ Malliavin calculus to determine the delta of European and Asian options, where the underlying asset evolves according to a Hawkes jump-diffusion process. A central feature is that the Hawkes jump intensity is stochastic, which substantially affects the delta representation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bougerol (1993) and Straumann and Mikosch (2006) gave conditions under which there exists a unique stationary and ergodic solution to the stochastic difference equation $Y_t \overset{a.s.}{=} \Phi_t (Y_{t-1}), t \in \mathbb{Z}$ where $(\Phi_t)_{t \in \mathbb{Z}}$ is a sequence of stationary and ergodic random Lipschitz continuous functions from $(Y,|| \cdot ||)$ to $(Y,|| \cdot ||)$ where $(Y,|| \cdot ||)$ is a complete subspace of a real or complex separable Banach space. In the case where $(Y,|| \cdot ||)$ is a real or complex separable Banach space, Straumann and Mikosch (2006) also gave conditions under which any solution to the stochastic difference equation $\hat{Y}_t \overset{a.s.}{=} \hat{\Phi}_t (\hat{Y}_{t-1}), t \in \mathbb{N}$ with $\hat{Y}_0$ given where $(\hat{\Phi}_t)_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ is only a sequence of random Lipschitz continuous functions from $(Y,|| \cdot ||)$ to $(Y,|| \cdot ||)$ satisfies $\gamma^t || \hat{Y}_t - Y_t || \overset{a.s.}{\rightarrow} 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$ for some $\gamma &gt; 1$. In this note, we give slightly different conditions under which this continues to hold in the case where $(Y,|| \cdot ||)$ is only a complete subspace of a real or complex separable Banach space by using close to identical arguments as Straumann and Mikosch (2006).</description>

      <title>A Universal Moments-Only Bound for Cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a simple, universal inequality that bounds the $n$-th cumulant of a real-valued random variable using only its $n$-th (absolute or central) moment. Specifically, for any integer $n \ge 1$, the $n$-th cumulant $\kappa_n(X)$ satisfies \[ \lvert \kappa_n(X) \rvert \;\le\; C_n\, \mathbb{E}\lvert X-\mathbb{E}X\rvert^{\,n}, \] with an alternative bound in terms of $\mathbb{E}\lvert X\rvert^{\,n}$ in the uncentered form. The coefficient $C_n$ is derived from the combinatorial structure of the moment--cumulant formula and exhibits the asymptotic behavior $C_n \sim (n-1)!/\rho^{\,n}$, giving an exponential improvement over classical bounds that grow on the order of $n^n$.
  In full generality, the bound involves the ordered Bell numbers, corresponding to a rate parameter $\rho=\ln 2\approx 0.693$. For $n\ge 2$, shift-invariance of cumulants yields a universal centered refinement with parameter $\rho_0\approx 1.146$, determined by $e^{\rho_0}=2+\rho_0$. For symmetric random variables, the bound sharpens further to $\rho_{\mathrm{sym}}=\operatorname{arcosh}2\approx 1.317$. These results extend naturally to the multivariate setting, providing uniform control of joint cumulants under the same minimal moment assumptions.</description>

      <title>Three-point connectivity constant for $q$-state Potts spin clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ang--Cai--Sun--Wu (2024) determined the three-point connectivity constant for two-dimensional critical percolation, confirming a prediction of Delfino and Viti (2010). In this paper, we address the analogous problem for planar critical $q$-state Potts spin clusters. We introduce a continuum three-point connectivity constant and compute it explicitly. Under the scaling-limit conjecture for Potts spin clusters, this quantity coincides with the scaling limit of the properly normalized probability that three points lie in the same spin cluster. The resulting formula agrees with the imaginary DOZZ formula up to an explicit $q$-dependent constant with a geometric interpretation. This answers a question from Delfino--Picco--Santachiara--Viti (2013). The proof exploits the coupling between CLE and LQG, together with the BCLE descriptions of $q$-state Potts scaling limits due to Miller--Sheffield--Werner (2017) and K\"ohler-Schindler and Lehmk\"uhler (2025).</description>

      <title>On the coming down from infinity of continuous-state branching processes with drift-interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of coming down from infinity - that is, when the process starts from infinity and never returns to it - for continuous-state branching processes with generalized drift. We provide sufficient conditions on the drift term and the branching mechanism to ensure both non-explosion and coming down from infinity, without requiring the associated jump measure to have a finite first moment. Assuming the process comes down from infinity and the drift satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition, we show that, as the initial values tend to infinity, the process converges locally uniformly almost surely to the strong solution of a stochastic differential equation. The main techniques employed are comparison principles for solutions of stochastic equations and the method of Lyapunov functions, the latter being briefly reviewed in a broader setting.</description>

      <title>A Preliminary Study: Pathwise Patching and the Geometric Nature of Quasi-Sure Existence in GSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a preliminary working perspective on constructing solutions to G-stochastic differential equations (GSDEs). We propose a pathwise patching methodology that offers a geometric interpretation for the concept of quasi-sure solutions. Unlike conventional methods based on fixed-point theorems in function spaces (which secure uniqueness in the quasi-sure sense), our approach focuses on defining the solution $X_t$ directly on the path space by synthesizing individual solutions $X^P$ obtained under different probability measures $P \in \mathcal{P}$.
  We first illustrate the core insight using a two-measure example ($P$ and $Q$), demonstrating how to "patch" $X^P$ and $X^Q$ by carefully handling the incompatible null sets $N_P$ and $N_Q$. We then extend this construction to the entire family of probability measures $\mathcal{P}$ induced by $G$-expectation, defining the universal solution $X_t$ on the union of "good sets" $\bigcup_{P \in \mathcal{P}} N_P^c$. This methodology geometrically reveals the intrinsic nature of quasi-sure analysis.
  This work serves as an initial conceptual step towards a complete geometric framework for $G$-stochastic calculus. We hypothesize that this pathwise construction yields the unique quasi-sure solution to the GSDE.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for a stochastic nonlinear damped Schrodinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper focuses on the stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equation with polynomial nonlinearity, and a zero-order (no derivatives involved) linear damping. Here, the random forcing term appears as a mix of a nonlinear noise in the Ito sense and a linear multiplicative noise in the Stratonovich sense. We prove the Laplace principle for the family of solutions to the stochastic system in a suitable Polish space, using the weak convergence framework of Budhiraja and Dupuis. This analysis is nontrivial, since it requires uniform estimates for the solutions of the associated controlled stochastic equation in the underlying solution space in order to verify the weak convergence criterion. The Wentzell Freidlin type large deviation principle is proved using Varadhan's lemma and Bryc's converse to Varadhan's lemma. The local well-posedness of the skeleton equation (deterministic controlled system) is established by employing the Banach fixed point theorem, and the global well posedness is established via Yosida approximation. We show that the conservation law holds in the absence of the linear damping and Ito noise. The well posedness of the stochastic controlled equation is also nontrivial in this case. We use a truncation method, a stopping time argument, and the Yosida technique to get the global well-posedness of the stochastic controlled equation.</description>

Abstract: The hard edge and bulk scaling limits of $\beta$-ensembles are described by the stochastic Bessel and sine operators, which are respectively a random Sturm-Liouville operator and a random Dirac operator. By representing both operators as canonical systems, we show that in a suitable high-energy scaling limit, the stochastic Bessel operator converges in law to the stochastic sine operator. This is first done in the vague topology of canonical systems' coefficient matrices, and then extended to the convergence of the associated Weyl-Titchmarsh functions and spectral measures. The proof relies on a coupling between the Brownian motions that drive the two operators, under which the convergence holds in probability.</description>

      <title>Minima and Critical Points of the Bethe Free Energy Are Invariant Under Deformation Retractions of Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In graphical models, factor graphs, and more generally energy-based models, the interactions between variables are encoded by a graph, a hypergraph, or, in the most general case, a partially ordered set (poset). Inference on such probabilistic models cannot be performed exactly due to cycles in the underlying structures of interaction. Instead, one resorts to approximate variational inference by optimizing the Bethe free energy. Critical points of the Bethe free energy correspond to fixed points of the associated Belief Propagation algorithm. A full characterization of these critical points for general graphs, hypergraphs, and posets with a finite number of variables is still an open problem. We show that, for hypergraphs and posets with chains of length at most 1, changing the poset of interactions of the probabilistic model to one with the same homotopy type induces a bijection between the critical points of the associated free energy. This result extends and unifies classical results that assume specific forms of collapsibility to prove uniqueness of the critical points of the Bethe free energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new sample complexity result for entropy regularized optimal transport. Our bound holds for probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$ with exponential tail decay and for radial cost functions that satisfy a local Lipschitz condition. It is sharp up to logarithmic factors, and captures the intrinsic dimension of the marginal distributions through a generalized covering number of their supports. Examples that fit into our framework include subexponential and subgaussian distributions and radial cost functions $c(x,y)=|x-y|^p$ for $p\ge 2.$</description>

      <title>Sharp thresholds for NAC-colourings and stable cuts in random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NAC-colourings of graphs correspond to flexible quasi-injective realisations in $\mathbb {R} ^2$. A special class of NAC-colourings are those that arise from stable cuts. We give sharp thresholds for the random graph to have no stable cut and to have no NAC-colouring via exact hitting-time results: with high probability, the random graph process gains both properties at the precise time that every vertex is in a triangle. Our thresholds complement recent results on the thresholds for the random graph to be generically or globally rigid in $\mathbb {R} ^d$, and for all injective realisations to be globally rigid in $\mathbb {R} $.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the Erd\H{o}s distinct subset sums problem in $\mathbb{Z}^k$. Beyond the classical variance method, using alternative statistical quantities like $\mathbb{E}[\|X\|_1]$ and $\mathbb{E}[\|X\|_3^3]$ can yield better bounds in certain dimensions. This innovation improves previous low-dimensional results and provides a framework for choosing suitable methods depending on the dimension.</description>

      <title>Measures of Dependence based on Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring dependence between random variables is a fundamental problem in Statistics, with applications across diverse fields. While classical measures such as Pearson's correlation have been widely used for over a century, they have notable limitations, particularly in capturing nonlinear relationships and extending to general metric spaces. In recent years, the theory of Optimal Transport and Wasserstein distances has provided new tools to define measures of dependence that generalize beyond Euclidean settings. This survey explores recent proposals, outlining two main approaches: one based on the distance between the joint distribution and the product of marginals, and another leveraging conditional distributions. We discuss key properties, including characterization of independence, normalization, invariances, robustness, sample, and computational complexity. Additionally, we propose an alternative perspective that measures deviation from maximal dependence rather than independence, leading to new insights and potential extensions. Our work highlights recent advances in the field and suggests directions for further research in the measurement of dependence using Optimal Transport.</description>

      <title>Distribution of mixed character sums and extremal problems for Littlewood polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove distributional results for mixed character sums \begin{equation*} \sum_{n\le x }\chi(n)e(n\theta), \end{equation*} for fixed $\theta\in [0,1]$ and random character $\chi \pmod q$, as well as for a fixed character $\chi$ and randomly sampled $\theta\in [0,1].$ We present various applications of our results. For example, we construct Littlewood polynomials with large Mahler measure, thus establishing a new record in the Mahler problem (1963). We also show that $L_{2k}$ norms of well-known Turyn polynomials are asymptotically minimized at the shift $\alpha=1/4,$ proving a conjecture of G\"unther and Schmidt. An important ingredient in our work is a general way of dealing with "log-integrability" problems.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for the number of excursion set components of Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth stationary Gaussian field on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and level $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$, we consider the number of connected components of the excursion set $\{f \ge \ell\}$ (or level set $\{f = \ell\}$) contained in large domains. The mean of this quantity is known to scale like the volume of the domain under general assumptions on the field. We prove that, assuming sufficient decay of correlations (e.g. the Bargmann-Fock field), a central limit theorem holds with volume-order scaling. Previously such a result had only been established for `additive' geometric functionals of the excursion/level sets (e.g. the volume or Euler characteristic) using Hermite expansions. Our approach, based on a martingale analysis, is more robust and can be generalised to a wider class of topological functionals. A major ingredient in the proof is a third moment bound on critical points, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Poisson Follower Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic geometry dynamics inspired by opinion dynamics that captures the essence of modern asymmetric social networks with leaders and followers. Points in Euclidean space represent opinions, and the leader of an agent is the one with the closest opinion. In this dynamics, each follower updates its opinion by halving the distance to its leader. We demonstrate that this simple dynamics and its iterations exhibit several interesting purely geometric phenomena related to the evolution of leadership and opinion clusters, which resemble those observed in social networks. We also show that when the initial opinions are randomly distributed as a stationary Poisson point process, the likelihood of each of these phenomena can be expressed through an integral geometry formula involving semi-algebraic domains. Furthermore, we establish this property for step 0 and step 1 of the dynamics using percolation techniques. Finally, we analyze numerically the limiting behavior of this follower dynamics. In the Poisson case, the agents fall into two categories: ultimate followers, who continue updating their opinions indefinitely, and ultimate leaders, who adopt a fixed opinion after a finite time. Spatial discrete event simulations support all our findings.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates of the heat kernel for random walks among time-dependent random conductances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a time-continuous random walk in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in a dynamical random environment with symmetric jump rates to nearest neighbours. We assume that these random conductances are stationary and ergodic and, moreover, that they are bounded from below but unbounded from above with finite first moment. We derive sharp on-diagonal estimates for the annealed first and second discrete space derivative of the heat kernel which then yield local limit theorems for the corresponding kernels. Assuming weak algebraic off-diagonal estimates, we then extend these results to the annealed Green function and its first and second derivative. Our proof which extends the result of Delmotte and Deuschel (2005) to unbounded conductances with first moment only, is an adaptation of the recent entropy method of Benjamini et. al. (2015).</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on Malliavin calculus in regularity structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malliavin calculus provides a characterization of the centered model in regularity structures that is stable under removing the small-scale cut-off. In conjunction with a spectral gap inequality, it yields the stochastic estimates of the model.
  This becomes transparent on the level of a notion of model that parameterizes the solution manifold, and thus is indexed by multi-indices rather than trees, and which allows for a more geometric than combinatorial perspective. In these lecture notes, this is carried out for a PDE with heat operator, a cubic nonlinearity, and driven by additive noise, reminiscent of the stochastic quantization of the Euclidean $\phi^4$ model.
  More precisely, we informally motivate our notion of the model $(\Pi,\Gamma)$ as charts and transition maps, respectively, of the nonlinear solution manifold. These geometric objects are algebrized in terms of formal power series, and their algebra automorphisms. We will assimilate the directional Malliavin derivative to a tangent vector of the solution manifold. This means that it can be treated as a modelled distribution, thereby connecting stochastic model estimates to pathwise solution theory, with its analytic tools of reconstruction and integration. We unroll an inductive calculus that in an automated way applies to the full subcritical regime.</description>

Abstract: The infinite-bin model is a one-dimensional particle system on $\mathbb{Z}$ introduced by Foss and Konstantopoulos in relation with last passage percolation on complete directed acyclic graphs. In this model, at each integer time, a particle is selected at random according to its rank, and produces a child at the location immediately to its right. In this article, we consider the limiting distribution of particles after an infinite number of branching events have occurred. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the event (called freezing) that a location contains only a finite number of balls satisfies a $0-1$ law and we provide various criteria to determine whether freezing occurs.</description>

Abstract: Consider independent long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq 3$. Assuming that the expected degree of the origin is infinite, we show that there exists an $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that an infinite open cluster remains after deleting all edges of length at least $N$. For the isotropic case in dimensions $d\geq 3$, we show that if the expected degree of the origin is at least $10^{400}$, then there exists an infinite open cluster almost surely. We also use these results to prove corresponding statements for the long-range $q$-states Potts model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a new characterization of sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates for strongly local regular Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. Our formulation is based on the newly introduced cutoff energy condition, which offers a simpler and more transparent alternative for earlier technical energy inequalities, in particular the cutoff Sobolev inequality. The main idea of our approach is to reinterpret the cutoff Sobolev inequality as a Poincar\'e type inequality, and analyze it using Haj{\l}asz--Koskela techniques from analysis on metric spaces. Applications of the new characterization are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the convex order between the distributions of linear functionals does not imply the convex order between the probability distributions over $\mathbb R^d$ if $d\ge2$. This stands in contrast with the well-known fact that any probability distribution in $\mathbb R^d$, for any $d\ge1$, is determined by the corresponding distributions of linear functionals. By duality, it follows that, for any $d\ge2$, not all convex functions from $\mathbb R^d$ to $\mathbb R$ can be represented as the limits of sums $\sum_{i=1}^k g_i\circ \ell_i$ of convex functions $g_i$ of linear functionals $\ell_i$ on $\mathbb R^d$.</description>

Abstract: We prove sandwich theorems and a Tauberian theorem in the space of compact metric measure spaces, endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov (GHP) topology. These results hold with respect to a close relative of Gromov's Lipschitz order. As a proof-of-concept of a general method to prove metric scaling limits of random discrete structures, we give an application to the theory of random planar maps: the Brownian sphere is the scaling limit in the GHP topology of irreducible quandrangulations. Our main inputs are (i) the convergence of general quadrangulations to the Brownian sphere (Le Gall, 2013; Miermont, 2013); and (ii) couplings where irreducible quadrangulations of the hexagon are "grown" by face-openings (Addario-Berry, 2014).</description>

      <title>Saturation in Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K^r_n$ be the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices, that is, the hypergraph whose vertex set is $[n]:=\{1,2,...,n\}$ and whose edge set is $\binom{[n]}{r}$. We form $G^r(n,p)$ by retaining each edge of $K^r_n$ independently with probability $p$.
  An $r$-uniform hypergraph $H\subseteq G$ is $F$-saturated if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$, but any missing edge of $H$ in $G$ creates a copy of $F$. Furthermore, we say that $H$ is weakly $F$-saturated in $G$ if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$, but the missing edges of $H$ in $G$ can be added back one-by-one, in some order, such that every edge creates a new copy of $F$. The smallest number of edges in an $F$-saturated hypergraph in $G$ is denoted by $sat(G,F)$, and in a weakly $F$-saturated hypergraph in $G$ by $wsat(G,F)$.
  In 2017, Kor\'andi and Sudakov initiated the study of saturation in random graphs, showing that for constant $p$, with high probability $sat(G(n,p),K_s)=(1+o(1))n\log_{\frac{1}{1-p}}n$, and $wsat(G(n,p),K_s)=wsat(K_n,K_s)$. Generalising their results, in this paper, we solve the suturation problem for random hypergraphs for every $2\le r &lt; s$ and constant $p$.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic exit-time control on the half-line over a finite horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a finite-time stochastic drift control problem with the assumption that the control is bounded and the system is controlled until the state process leaves the half-line. Assuming general conditions, it is proved that the resulting parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation has a classical solution. In fact, we consider an even more general family of semilinear equations, which might be helpful in solving other control or game problems. Not only is the existence result proved, but also a recursive procedure for finding a solution resulting from a fixed-point argument is provided. An application to the dividend optimization problem is presented.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete finite element methods for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a fully discrete finite element approximation for the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, combining the standard finite element methods in spatial discretization with the implicit Euler-Maruyama scheme in time. Rigorous error estimates are established for two distinct noise regimes. In the case of bounded multiplicative noise, we prove optimal strong convergence rates in full expectation. The analysis relies crucially on a stochastic Gronwall inequality and an exponential stability estimate for the PDE solution, which together control the interplay between the nonlinear drift and the multiplicative stochastic forcing. For general multiplicative noise, where boundedness no longer holds, we derive sub-optimal convergence rates in probability by introducing a localization technique based on carefully constructed subsets of the sample space. This dual framework demonstrates that the proposed fully discrete scheme achieves strong convergence under bounded noise and probabilistic convergence under general multiplicative noise, thus providing the first comprehensive error analysis for numerical approximations of the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo under the stochastic exponential Euler discretization from underdamped all the way to overdamped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics is a popular approach for sampling from distributions, where only their unnormalized densities are available. Various discretizations of the kinetic Langevin dynamics have been considered, where the resulting algorithm is collectively referred to as the kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo (KLMC) or underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo. Specifically, the stochastic exponential Euler discretization, or exponential integrator for short, has previously been studied under strongly log-concave and log-Lipschitz smooth potentials via the synchronous Wasserstein coupling strategy. Existing analyses, however, impose restrictions on the parameters that do not explain the behavior of KLMC under various choices of parameters. In particular, all known results fail to hold in the overdamped regime, suggesting that the exponential integrator degenerates in the overdamped limit. In this work, we revisit the synchronous Wasserstein coupling analysis of KLMC with the exponential integrator. Our refined analysis results in Wasserstein contractions and bounds on the asymptotic bias that hold under weaker restrictions on the parameters, which assert that the exponential integrator is capable of stably simulating the kinetic Langevin dynamics in the overdamped regime, as long as proper time acceleration is applied.</description>

      <title>Constrained Dikin-Langevin diffusion for polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interior-point geometry offers a straightforward approach to constrained sampling and optimization on polyhedra, eliminating reflections and ad hoc projections. We exploit the Dikin log-barrier to define a Dikin--Langevin diffusion whose drift and noise are modulated by the inverse barrier Hessian. In continuous time, we establish a boundary no-flux property; trajectories started in the interior remain in $U$ almost surely, so feasibility is maintained by construction. For computation, we adopt a discretize-then-correct design: an Euler--Maruyama proposal with state-dependent covariance, followed by a Metropolis--Hastings correction that targets the exact constrained law and reduces to a Dikin random walk when $f$ is constant.
  Numerically, the unadjusted diffusion exhibits the expected first-order step size bias, while the MH-adjusted variant delivers strong convergence diagnostics on anisotropic, box-constrained Gaussians (rank-normalized split-$\hat{R}$ concentrated near $1$) and higher inter-well transition counts on a bimodal target, indicating superior cross-well mobility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that coupling calibrated stochasticity with interior-point preconditioning provides a practical, reflection-free approach to sampling and optimization over polyhedral domains, offering clear advantages near faces, corners, and in nonconvex landscapes.</description>
