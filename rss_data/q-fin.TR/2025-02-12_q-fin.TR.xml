      <title>TRADES: Generating Realistic Market Simulations with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07071v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical noise, nonlinearity, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely hard. We address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and testing trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and generating synthetic market data. Previous works lack realism, usefulness, and responsiveness of the generated simulations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB Simulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows conditioned on the state of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There is a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market simulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the predictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, by training a stock price predictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare TRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting an x3.27 and x3.47 improvement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we generate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. We assess TRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it effectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to an experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations of trading strategies and market impact experiments. We developed DeepMarket, the first open-source Python framework for market simulation with deep learning. Our repository includes a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's generates simulations. We release the code at github.com/LeonardoBerti00/DeepMarket.</description>

      <title>FinRL-DeepSeek: LLM-Infused Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning for Trading Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel risk-sensitive trading agent combining reinforcement learning and large language models (LLMs). We extend the Conditional Value-at-Risk Proximal Policy Optimization (CPPO) algorithm, by adding risk assessment and trading recommendation signals generated by a LLM from financial news. Our approach is backtested on the Nasdaq-100 index benchmark, using financial news data from the FNSPID dataset and the DeepSeek V3, Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.3 language models. The code, data, and trading agents are available at: https://github.com/benstaf/FinRL_DeepSeek</description>

      <title>Intraday order transition dynamics in high, medium, and low market cap stocks: A Markov chain approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An empirical stochastic analysis of high-frequency, tick-by-tick order data of NASDAQ100 listed stocks is conducted using a first-order discrete-time Markov chain model to explore intraday order transition dynamics. This analysis focuses on three market cap categories: High, Medium, and Low. Time-homogeneous transition probability matrices are estimated and compared across time-zones and market cap categories, and we found that limit orders exhibit higher degree of inertia (DoI), i.e., the probability of placing consecutive limit order is higher, during the opening hour. However, in the subsequent hour, the DoI of limit order decreases, while that of market order increases. Limit order adjustments via additions and deletions of limit orders increases significantly after the opening hour. All the order transitions then stabilize during mid-hours. As the closing hour approaches, consecutive order executions surge, with decreased placement of buy and sell limit orders following sell and buy executions, respectively. In terms of the differences in order transitions between stocks of different market cap, DoI of orders is stronger in high and medium market cap stocks. On the other hand, lower market cap stocks show a higher probability of limit order modifications and greater likelihood of submitting sell/buy limit orders after buy/sell executions. Further, order transitions are clustered across all stocks, except during opening and closing hours. The findings of this study may be useful in understanding intraday order placement dynamics across stocks of varying market cap, thus aiding market participants in making informed order placements at different times of trading hour.</description>
