      <title>Rigged Horse Numbers and their Modular Periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The permutations of horse racing, where ties are possible, are counted by the $\textit{Fubini numbers}$, also called the $\textit{horse numbers}$. The $\textit{r-horse numbers}$ are a counting of such horse race finishes where some subset of $r$ horses agree to finish the race in a specific strong ordering. The $r$-horse numbers for fixed $r$ are expressed as a sum of $r$ index shifted sequences of Fubini numbers weighted with the $\textit{signed Stirling numbers of the first kind}$. Then eventual modular periodicity of $\textit{r-Fubini numbers}$ is shown and their maximum period is determined to be the $\textit{Carmichael function}$ of the modulus. The maximum period is attained in the case of an odd modulus for Fubini numbers.</description>

      <title>Deriving differential approximation results for $k\,$CSPs from combinatorial designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, inapproximability results for $\mathsf{Max\,k\,CSP\!-\!q}$ have been established using balanced $t$-wise independent distributions, which are related to orthogonal arrays of strength $t$. We contribute to the field by exploring such combinatorial designs in the context of the differential approximation measure. First, we establish a connection between the average differential ratio and orthogonal arrays. We deduce a differential approximation ratio of $1/q^k$ on $(k +1)$-partite instances of $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!q}$, $\Omega(1/n^{k/2})$ on Boolean instances, $\Omega(1/n)$ when $k =2$, and $\Omega(1/\nu^{k -\lceil\log_{p^\kappa} k\rceil})$ when $k\geq 3$ and $q\geq 3$, where $p^\kappa$ is the smallest prime power greater than $q$. Secondly, by considering pairs of arrays related to balanced $k$-wise independence, we establish a reduction from $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!q}$ to $\mathsf{k\,CSP\!-\!k}$ (with $q&gt;k$), with an expansion factor of $1/(q -k/2)^k$ on the differential approximation guarantee. This, combined with the result of Yuri Nesterov, implies a lower differential approximability bound of $0.429/(q -1)^2$ for $\mathsf{2\,CSP\!-\!q}$. Finally, we prove that every Hamming ball with radius $k$ provides a $\Omega(1/n^k)$-approximation of the instance diameter. Our work highlights the utility of combinatorial designs in establishing approximation results.</description>

      <title>Expected Natural Density of Countable Sets after Infinitely Iterated de Finetti Lotteries, Computed via Matrix Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a fair lottery over the natural numbers in which the selected number is removed. This lottery is iterated countably infinite times, with a known ratio of iterations to natural numbers. Removed numbers are not replaced. The natural numbers are partitioned into two sets with a given ratio of elements, which is tracked along each iteration of the lottery.
  Hess and Polisetty considered and investigated such a process and reported the expected values of the densities for some particular cases.
  In this work, we provide a novel framework for computing these expected densities using infinite matrices. The results presented in this work generalize previous results.</description>

      <title>Stability of ranks under field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of tensor ranks under field extensions. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We prove that the analytic rank is stable under field extensions. (2) We establish the equivalence between the partition rank vs. analytic rank conjecture and the stability conjecture for partition rank. We also prove that they are equivalent to other two important conjectures. (3) We resolve the Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler conjecture on the stability of the slice rank of linear subspaces under field extensions. (4) As an application of (1), we show that the geometric rank is equal to the analytic rank up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Kim, Kim and Liu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1969, Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s initiated the study of the Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n type problems: Determine the maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex $K_{p+1}$-free graph without large independent set. Given integers $p, q\ge2$, we say that a graph $G$ is $(K_p,K_q)$-free if there exists a red/blue edge coloring of $G$ such that it contains neither a red $K_p$ nor a blue $K_q$. Fix a function $f( n )$, the Ramsey-Tur\'{a}n number $RT( {n,p,q,f( n ))} $ is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $(K_p,K_q)$-free graph with independence number at most $f( n )$. For any $\delta&gt;0$, let $\rho (p, q,\delta ) = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{n \to \infty } \frac{RT(n,p, q,\delta n)}{n^2}$. Kim, Kim and Liu (2019) determined the value of $\rho(3,p,\delta)$ for $p=3,4,5$ and sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$. Moreover, they showed $\rho(3,6,\delta)\ge \frac{5}{12}+\frac{\delta}{2}+2\delta^2$ from a skilful construction and conjectured the equality holds for sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$. In this paper, we obtain $\rho(3,6,\delta)\le\frac{5}{{12}} + \frac{\delta }{2}+ 2.1025\delta ^2$ for sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$, which is pretty close to solving the conjecture. The key step of the proof is to establish a stability lemma of the $n$-vertex graph that is $(K_3,K_6)$-free with independence number $\delta n$.</description>

      <title>Extending a result of Carlitz and McConnel to polynomials which are not permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ denote the set of directions determined by the graph of a polynomial $f$ of $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$, where $q$ is a power of the prime $p$. If $D$ is contained in a multiplicative subgroup $M$ of $\mathbb{F}_q^\times$, then by a result of Carlitz and McConnel it follows that $f(x)=ax^{p^k}+b$ for some $k\in \mathbb{N}$. Of course, if $D\subseteq M$, then $0\notin D$ and hence $f$ is a permutation. If we assume the weaker condition $D\subseteq M \cup \{0\}$, then $f$ is not necessarily a permutation, but Sziklai conjectured that $f(x)=ax^{p^k}+b$ follows also in this case. When $q$ is odd, and the index of $M$ is even, then a result of Ball, Blokhuis, Brouwer, Storme and Sz\H onyi combined with a result of McGuire and G\"olo\u{g}lu proves the conjecture. Assume $\deg f\geq 1$. We prove that if the size of $D^{-1}D=\{d^{-1}d' : d\in D\setminus \{0\},\, d'\in D\}$ is less than $q-\deg f+2$, then $f$ is a permutation of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We use this result to verify the conjecture of Sziklai.</description>

      <title>Cumulants in rectangular finite free probability and beta-deformed singular values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the $(q,\gamma)$-cumulants, introduced by Xu [arXiv:2303.13812] to study $\beta$-deformed singular values of random matrices, we define the $(n,d)$-rectangular cumulants for polynomials of degree $d$ and prove several moment-cumulant formulas by elementary algebraic manipulations; the proof naturally leads to quantum analogues of the formulas. We further show that the $(n,d)$-rectangular cumulants linearize the $(n,d)$-rectangular convolution from Finite Free Probability and that they converge to the $q$-rectangular free cumulants from Free Probability in the regime where $d\to\infty$, $1+n/d\to q\in[1,\infty)$. As an application, we employ our formulas to study limits of symmetric empirical root distributions of sequences of polynomials with nonnegative roots. One of our results is akin to a theorem of Kabluchko [arXiv:2203.05533] and shows that applying the operator $\exp(-\frac{s^2}{n}x^{-n}D_xx^{n+1}D_x)$, where $s&gt;0$, asymptotically amounts to taking the rectangular free convolution with the rectangular Gaussian distribution of variance $qs^2/(q-1)$.</description>

      <title>On the Frobenius norm of the inverse of a non-negative matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new lower bound for the Frobenius norm of the inverse of an non-negative matrix. This bound is only a modest improvement over previous results, but is sufficient for fully resolving a conjecture of Harwitz and Sloane, commonly referred to as the S-matrix conjecture, for all dimensions larger than a small constant.</description>

      <title>Hyper-bishops, Hyper-rooks, and Hyper-queens: Percentage of Safe Squares on Higher Dimensional Chess Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $n$ queens problem considers the maximum number of safe squares on an $n \times n$ chess board when placing $n$ queens; the answer is only known for small $n$. Miller, Sheng and Turek considered instead $n$ randomly placed rooks, proving the proportion of safe squares converges to $1/e^2$. We generalize and solve when randomly placing $n$ hyper-rooks and $n^{k-1}$ line-rooks on a $k$-dimensional board, using combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with the proportion of safe squares converging to $1/e^k$. We prove that the proportion of safe squares on an $n \times n$ board with bishops in 2 dimensions converges to $2/e^2$. This problem is significantly more interesting and difficult; while a rook attacks the same number of squares wherever it's placed, this is not so for bishops. We expand to the $k$-dimensional chessboard, defining line-bishops to attack along $2$-dimensional diagonals and hyper-bishops to attack in the $k-1$ dimensional subspace defined by its diagonals in the $k-2$ dimensional subspace. We then combine the movement of rooks and bishops to consider the movement of queens in 2 dimensions, as well as line-queens and hyper-queens in $k$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the minimal displacement set in weakly systolic complexes. We show that such set is systolic and that it embeds isometrically into the complex. As corollaries, we prove that any isometry of a weakly systolic complex either fixes the barycentre of some simplex (elliptic case) or it stabilizes a thick geodesic (hyperbolic case).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the equivariant K-theory of torus fixed points of Cherkis bow varieties of affine type A. We deduce formulas for the generating series of the Euler numbers of these varieties and observe their modularity in certain cases. We also obtain refined formulas on the motivic level for a class of bow varieties strictly containing Nakajima quiver varieties. These series hence generalise results of Nakajima-Yoshioka. As a special case, we obtain formulas for certain Zastava spaces. We define a parabolic analogue of Nekrasov's partition function and find an equation relating it to the classical partition function.</description>

      <title>Constant congestion linkages in polynomially strong digraphs in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given integers $k,c &gt; 0$, we say that a digraph $D$ is $(k,c)$-linked if for every pair of ordered sets $\{s_1, \ldots, s_k\}$ and $\{t_1, \ldots, t_k\}$ of vertices of $D$, there are $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ such that for $i \in [k]$ each $P_i$ is a path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ and every vertex of $D$ appears in at most $c$ of those paths. Thomassen [Combinatorica, 1991] showed that for every fixed $k \geq 2$ there is no integer $p$ such that every $p$-strong digraph is $(k,1)$-linked. Edwards et al. [ESA, 2017] showed that every digraph $D$ with directed treewidth at least some function $f(k)$ contains a large bramble of congestion $2$ and that every $(36k^3 + 2k)$-strong digraph containing a bramble of congestion $2$ and size roughly $188k^3$ is $(k,2)$-linked. Since the directed treewidth of a digraph has to be at least its strong connectivity, this implies that there is a function $L(k)$ such that every $L(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,2)$-linked. This result was improved by Campos et al. [ESA, 2023], who showed that any $k$-strong digraph containing a bramble of size at least $2k(c\cdot k -c + 2) + c(k-1)$ and congestion $c$ is $(k,c)$-linked. Regarding the bramble, although the given bound on $f(k)$ is very large, Masa\v{r}\'{\i}k et al. [SIDMA, 2022] showed that directed treewidth $\mathcal{O}(k^{48}\log^{13} k)$ suffices if the congestion is relaxed to $8$. We first show how to drop the dependence on $c$, for even $c$, on the size of the bramble that is needed in the work of Campos et al. [ESA, 2023]. Then, by making two local changes in the proof of Masa\v{r}\'{\i}k et al. [SIDMA, 2022] we show how to build in polynomial time a bramble of size $k$ and congestion $8$ assuming that a large obstruction to directed treewidth (namely, a path system) is given. Applying these results, we show that there is a polynomial function $g(k)$ such that every $g(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,8)$-linked.</description>

      <title>The action of component groups on irreducible components of Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers.</description>

      <title>Greedy and randomized heuristics for optimization of k-domination models in digraphs and road networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed graphs provide more subtle and precise modelling tools for optimization in road networks than simple graphs. In particular, they are more suitable in the context of alternative fuel vehicles and new automotive technologies, like electric vehicles. In this paper, we introduce the new general concept of a reachability digraph associated with a road network to model the placement of refuelling facilities in road networks as k-dominating sets in the reachability digraph. Two new greedy heuristics are designed and experimentally tested to search for small k-dominating sets in two types of digraphs, including the reachability digraphs. Refined greedy strategies are shown to be efficient, capable of finding good quality solutions, and suitable for application in very large digraphs and road networks. Also, a probabilistic method is used to prove a new upper bound on the k-domination number of a digraph, which informs the development of a new randomized heuristic to search for k-dominating sets in the digraph. Generalizing the randomized heuristic ideas, making the heuristic more flexible, tuning and combining it with the greedy strategies allows us to obtain even better results for the reachability digraphs. Computational experiments are conducted for a case study of road networks in the West Midlands (UK).</description>

      <title>Random Geometric Graphs in Reflexive Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a random geometric graph model introduced by Bonato and Janssen. The vertices are the points of a countable dense set $S$ in a (necessarily separable) normed vector space $X$, and each pair of points are joined independently with some fixed probability $p$ (with $0&lt;p&lt;1$) if they are less than distance $1$ apart. A countable dense set $S$ in a normed space is Rado, if the resulting graph is almost surely unique up to isomorphism: that is any two such graphs are, almost surely, isomorphic.
  Not surprisingly, understanding which sets are Rado is closely related to the geometry of the underlying normed space. It turns out that a key question is in which spaces must step-isometries (maps that preserve the integer parts of distances) on dense subsets necessarily be isometries. We answer this question for a large class of Banach spaces including all strictly convex reflexive spaces. In the process we prove results on the interplay between the norm topology and weak topology that may be of independent interest.
  As a consequence of these Banach space results we show that almost all countable dense sets in strictly convex reflexive spaces are strongly non-Rado (that is, any two graphs are almost surely non-isomorphic). However, we show that there do exist Rado sets even in $\ell_2$. Finally we construct a Banach spaces in which all countable dense set are strongly non-Rado.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic of a very affine variety encodes the algebraic complexity of solving likelihood (or scattering) equations on this variety. We study this quantity for the Grassmannian with $d$ hyperplane sections removed. We provide a combinatorial formula, and explain how to compute this Euler characteristic in practice, both symbolically and numerically. Our particular focus is on generic hyperplane sections and on Schubert divisors. We also consider special Schubert arrangements relevant for physics. We study both the complex and the real case.</description>

      <title>A characterization of always solvable trees in the Lights Out game using the activation types of vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lights out is a game that can be played on any simple graph $G$. A configuration assigns one of the two states \emph{on} or \emph{off} to each vertex. For a given configuration, the aim of the game is to turn all vertices \emph{off} by applying a push pattern on vertices, where each push switches the state of the vertex and its neighbors. If every configuration of vertices is solvable, then we say that the graph is always solvable. We introduce a concept which we call the activation types of vertices and we prove several characterization results of trees by using this concept. We showed that all always solvable trees different than the star tree can be seen as the join graph of its two always solvable subtrees. We call the dimension of the space of null-patterns, which leave configurations unchanged, the nullity of the graph $G$. We show that the nullity of a tree can be characterized by the cardinality of its minimal partition into always solvable subtrees. We also showed that nullity of a tree is less than the number of its even degree vertices.</description>

      <title>Parity of an odd dominating set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.10270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)=\{v_1,...,v_n\}$, we define the closed neighborhood set of a vertex $u$ as $N[u]=\{v \in V(G) \; | \; v \; \text{is adjacent to} \; u \; \text{or} \; v=u \}$ and the closed neighborhood matrix $N(G)$ as the matrix obtained by setting to $1$ all the diagonal entries of the adjacency matrix of $G$. We say a set $S$ is odd dominating if $N[u]\cap S$ is odd for all $u\in V(G)$. We prove that the parity of an odd dominating set of $G$ is equal to the parity of the rank of $G$, where the rank of $G$ is defined as the dimension of the column space of $N(G)$. Using this result we prove several corollaries in one of which we obtain a general formula for the nullity of the join of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.12318v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the structure of braid graphs in simply-laced Coxeter systems. We prove that every reduced expression has a unique factorization as a product of so-called links, which in turn induces a decomposition of the braid graph into a box product of the braid graphs for each link factor. When the Coxeter graph has no three-cycles, we use the decomposition to prove that braid graphs are partial cubes, i.e., can be isometrically embedded into a hypercube. For a special class of links, called Fibonacci links, we prove that the corresponding braid graphs are Fibonacci cubes.</description>

      <title>Effects of edge addition or removal on the nullity of a graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lights Out is a game which can be played on any graph $G$. Initially we have a configuration which assigns one of the two states on or off to each vertex. The aim of the game is to turn all vertices to off state for an initial configuration by activating some vertices where each activation switches the state of the vertex and all of its neighbors. If the aim of the game can be accomplished for all initial configurations then $G$ is called always solvable. We call the dimension of the kernel of the closed neighborhood matrix of the graph over the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$, nullity of $G$. It turns out that $G$ is always solvable if and only if its nullity is zero. Moreover, the number of solutions of a given configuration is also determined by the nullity. We investigate the problem of how nullity changes when an edge is added to or removed from a graph. As a result we show that for every graph with positive nullity there exists an edge whose removal decreases the nullity. Conversely, we show that for every always solvable graph which is not an even graph with odd order, there exists an edge whose addition increases the nullity. We also show that if an always solvable graph is not even, then there is an edge whose removal increases the nullity.</description>

      <title>The minimum number of chains in a noncrossing partition of a poset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of noncrossing partitions of a partially ordered set (poset) is introduced here. When the poset in question is $[n]=\{1,2,\dots, n\}$ with the complete order of natural numbers, conventional noncrossing partitions arise. The minimum possible number of chains contained in a noncrossing partition of a poset clearly reflects the structural complexity of the poset. For the poset $[n]$, this number is just one. However, for a generic poset, it is a challenging task to determine the minimum number. Our main result in the paper is some characterization of this quantity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce shifted analogues of key polynomials related to symplectic and orthogonal orbit closures in the complete flag variety. Our definitions are given by applying isobaric divided difference operators to the analogues of Schubert polynomials for orbit closures that correspond to dominant involutions. We show that our shifted key polynomials are linear combinations of key polynomials with nonnegative integer coefficients. We also prove that they are partial versions of the classical Schur $P$- and $Q$-polynomials. Finally, we examine $K$-theoretic generalizations of these functions, which give shifted forms of Lascoux polynomials. In the symplectic case, these generalizations are partial versions of the $GP$-polynomials introduced by Ikeda and Naruse. Besides developing basic properties, we identify a number of conjectures and open problems.</description>

      <title>Crystals for shifted key polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article continues our study of $P$- and $Q$-key polynomials, which are (non-symmetric) "partial" Schur $P$- and $Q$-functions as well as "shifted" versions of key polynomials. Our main results provide a crystal interpretation of $P$- and $Q$-key polynomials, namely, as the characters of certain connected subcrystals of normal crystals associated to the queer Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{q}_n$. In the $P$-key case, the ambient normal crystals are the $\mathfrak{q}_n$-crystals studied by Grantcharov et al., while in the $Q$-key case, these are replaced by the extended $\mathfrak{q}_n$-crystals recently introduced by the first author and Tong. Using these constructions, we propose a crystal-theoretic lift of several conjectures about the decomposition of involution Schubert polynomials into $P$- and $Q$-key polynomials. We verify these generalized conjectures in a few special cases. Along the way, we establish some miscellaneous results about normal $\mathfrak{q}_n$-crystals and Demazure $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-crystals.</description>

      <title>Towards the Overfull Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph with maximum degree denoted as $\Delta(G)$. An overfull subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a subgraph satisfying the condition $|E(H)| &gt; \Delta(G)\lfloor \frac{1}{2}|V(H)| \rfloor$. In 1986, Chetwynd and Hilton proposed the Overfull Conjecture, stating that a graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta(G)&gt; \frac{1}{3}|V(G)|$ has chromatic index equal to $\Delta(G)$ if and only if it does not contain any overfull subgraph. The Overfull Conjecture has many implications. For example, it implies a polynomial-time algorithm for determining the chromatic index of graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) &gt; \frac{1}{3}|V(G)|$, and implies several longstanding conjectures in the area of graph edge colorings. In this paper, we make the first breakthrough towards the conjecture when not imposing a minimum degree condition on the graph: for any $0&lt;\varepsilon \le \frac{1}{14}$, there exists a positive integer $n_0$ such that if $G$ is a graph on $n\ge n_0$ vertices with $\Delta(G) \ge (1-\varepsilon)n$, then the Overfull Conjecture holds for $G$. The previous best result in this direction, due to Chetwynd and Hilton from 1989, asserts the conjecture for graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) \ge |V(G)|-3$. Our result also implies the Average Degree Conjecture of Vizing from 1968 for the same class of graphs $G$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two new bases of QSym, the flipped extended Schur functions and the backward extended Schur functions, as well as their duals in NSym, the flipped shin functions and the backward shin functions. These bases are the images of the extended Schur basis and shin basis under the involutions $\rho$ and $\omega$ on the quasisymmetric and noncommutative symmetric functions, which generalize the classical involution $\omega$ on the symmetric functions. In addition, we prove a Jacobi-Trudi rule for certain shin functions using creation operators. We define skew extended Schur functions and skew-II extended Schur functions based on left and right actions of NSym and QSym respectively. We then use the involutions $\rho$ and $\omega$ to translate these and other known results to our flipped and backward bases.</description>

Abstract: Lopsp-operations are operations on maps that are applied locally and are guaranteed to preserve all the orientation-preserving symmetries of maps. Well-known examples of such operations are dual, ambo, truncation, and leapfrog. They are described by plane 3-coloured triangulations with specific properties. We developed and implemented a program that can generate all lopsp-operations of a given size by reducing the problem of generating lopsp-operations to generating all plane quadrangulations that are not necessarily simple. We extended the program plantri to generate these quadrangulations.</description>

      <title>Recovering a Magnitude-Symmetric Matrix from its Principal Minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of finding a magnitude-symmetric matrix (matrix with opposing off-diagonal entries equal in magnitude) with a prescribed set of principal minors. This problem is closely related to the theory of recognizing and learning signed determinantal point processes in machine learning, as kernels of these point processes are magnitude-symmetric matrices. In this work, we prove a number of properties regarding sparse and generic magnitude-symmetric matrices. We show that principal minors of order at most $\ell$, for some invariant $\ell$ depending only on principal minors of order at most two, uniquely determines principal minors of all orders. In addition, we produce a polynomial-time algorithm that, given access to principal minors, recovers a matrix with those principal minors using only a quadratic number of queries. Furthermore, when principal minors are known only approximately, we present an algorithm that approximately recovers a matrix, and show that the approximation guarantee of this algorithm cannot be improved in general.</description>

      <title>Improving the Gilbert-Varshamov bound for permutation Codes in the Cayley metric and Kendall $\tau$-Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cayley distance between two permutations $\pi, \sigma \in S_n$ is the minimum number of \textit{transpositions} required to obtain the permutation $\sigma$ from $\pi$. When we only allow adjacent transpositions, the minimum number of such transpositions to obtain $\sigma$ from $\pi$ is referred to the Kendall $\tau$-distance. A set $C$ of permutation words of length $n$ is called a $d$-Cayley permutation code if every pair of distinct permutations in $C$ has Cayley distance at least $d$. A $d$-Kendall permutation code is defined similarly. Let $C(n,d)$ and $K(n,d)$ be the maximum size of a $d$-Cayley and a $d$-Kendall permutation code of length $n$, respectively. In this paper, we improve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound asymptotically by a factor $\log(n)$, namely \[ C(n,d+1) \geq \Omega_d\left(\frac{n!\log n}{n^{2d}}\right) \text{ and } K(n,d+1) \geq \Omega_d\left(\frac{n! \log n}{n^d}\right).\] Our proof is based on graph theory techniques.</description>

In this paper, we prove that provided $n$ is sufficiently large, for any $\mathcal{F}\subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ with $|\mathcal{F}|=m$, $\omega(\mathcal{F})$ is maximized by the family consisting of the first $m$ sets in the lexicographical ordering on $\binom{[n]}{k}$. Compared to the maximum number of adjacent pairs in families, determined by Das, Gan and Sudakov in 2016, $\omega(\mathcal{F})$ distinguishes the contributions of intersections of different sizes. Then our results is an extension of Ahlswede and Katona's results in 1978, which determine the maximum number of adjacent edges in graphs. Besides, since $\omega(\mathcal{F})=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{x\in [n]}|\{F\in \mathcal{F}:x\in F\}|^2-km\right)$ for $k$-uniform family with size $m$, our results also give a sharp upper bound of the sum of squares of degrees in a hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Multilevel polynomial partitioning and semialgebraic hypergraphs: regularity, Tur\'an, and Zarankiewicz results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove three main results about semialgebraic hypergraphs. First, we prove an optimal and oblivious regularity lemma. Fox, Pach, and Suk proved that the class of $k$-uniform semialgebraic hypergraphs satisfies a very strong regularity lemma where the vertex set can be partitioned into $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ parts so that all but an $\varepsilon$-fraction of $k$-tuples of parts are homogeneous (either complete or empty). Our result improves the number of parts in the partition to $O_{d,k}((D/\varepsilon)^{d})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space and $D$ is a measure of the complexity of the hypergraph; additionally, the partition is oblivious to the edge set of the hypergraph. We give examples that show that the dependence on both $\varepsilon$ and $D$ is optimal.
  From this regularity lemma we deduce the best-known Tur\'an-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Third, we prove a Zarankiewicz-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Previously Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl showed that a $K_{u,u}$-free semialgebraic graph on $N$ vertices has at most $O_{d,D,u}(N^{2d/(d+1)+o(1)})$ edges and Do extended this result to $K_{u,\ldots,u}^{(k)}$-free semialgebraic hypergraphs. We improve upon both of these results by removing the $o(1)$ in the exponent and making the dependence on $D$ and $u$ explicit and polynomial.
  All three of these results follow from a novel ``multilevel polynomial partitioning scheme'' that efficiently partitions a point set $P\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ via low-complexity semialgebraic pieces. We prove this result using the polynomial method over varieties as developed by Walsh which extends the real polynomial partitioning technique of Guth and Katz.
  We give additional applications to the unit distance problem, the Erd\H{o}s--Hajnal problem for semialgebraic graphs, and property testing of semialgebraic hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic random graphs with vertex removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a Dynamic Random Graph with Vertex Removal (DRGVR) defined as follows. At every step, with probability $p &gt; 1/2$ a new vertex is introduced, and with probability $1-p$ a vertex, chosen uniformly at random among the present ones (if any), is removed from the graph together with all edges adjacent to it. In the former case, the new vertex connects by an edge to every other vertex with probability inversely proportional to the number of vertices already present.
  We prove that the DRGVR converges to a local limit and determine this limit. Moreover, we analyse its component structure and distinguish a subcritical and a supercritical regime with respect to the existence of a giant component. As a byproduct of this analysis, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the critical parameter. Furthermore, we provide precise expression of the maximum degree (as well as in- and out-degree for a natural orientation of the DRGVR). Several concentration and stability results complete the study.</description>

      <title>Degenerate and irregular topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>
