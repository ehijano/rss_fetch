      <title>Complex network analysis of pore structures in monodisperse granular materials with varied grain shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how pore structure influences flow and transport behaviour in granular materials is essential for addressing a wide range of geotechnical, hydraulic, and environmental challenges. These processes are largely shaped by the microscopic arrangement of particles and interconnections between pores within the material. However, detailed insights considering granular assemblies with diversified grain shapes remain scarce. This study introduces a comprehensive framework incorporating Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, image processing, pore-network modelling, and complex network theory to investigate the links between particle morphology and their hydraulic behaviours. Mono-disperse assemblies of natural sand particles with varied shapes are constructed in DEM, and pore networks are extracted through image processing and pore-network modelling. Complex network analysis is then applied to calculate structural metrics that reveal intrinsic relationships between pore microstructures and hydraulic properties. Our results demonstrate that particle morphology significantly impacts pore network characteristics, including pore and throat sizes, closeness centrality, pore structure anisotropy, providing valuable insights into how pore structure influence transport properties.</description>

      <title>Entangled-to-packed crossover in nonlinear extensional rheology of entangled polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant challenges exist in the nonlinear extensional rheology of entangled polymers. With simulations, we show that the key to understanding this problem is to recognize the existence and importance of a strain-induced crossover from the entangled state to a packed state. This crossover, following the saturation of primitive chain stretch, takes place with massive release of entanglements via convective flow and progressive chain alignment. After the crossover, the disentangled, fully-aligned chain segments pack similarly to the random packing of rods. Meanwhile, the system enters the steady state. In this state, the tube model, built on the concept of entanglement, fails, while the stress can be quantitatively calculated by combining the intra-chain conformational contribution and a frictional contribution from the inter-chain separation along flow.</description>

      <title>Classical density functional treatment of polydisperse polarisable clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion clustering has been proposed as a mechanism leading to the peculiar 'anomalous underscreening' phenomenon seen for electrostatic interactions between charge surfaces immersed in concentrated electrolytes. These interactions have been measured using the Surface Force Apparatus, according to which there are strong repulsive interactions between like-charged surfaces, with a range that increases upon further addition of salt, above some threshold concentration. A common suggestion is that ionic aggregates, if they form in sufficient numbers, will reduce the concentration of free ions and thereby increase the nominal Debye length. In previous work, we investigated a cluster model using classical Density Functional Theory (cDFT) and a polymer-like description of the ion clusters. These clusters were monodisperse and of either a linear or branched architecture, and a fixed charge sequence along the chains. In this work, we generalise the cDFT to treat 'living polymers' with variable chain lengths and charge arrangements along the chain. This approach allows clusters to become polarised by the presence of charged surfaces, manifested by like-charged bonding. We find that even with a small degree of like-charged bonding a full equilibrium treatment of our model predicts only weak repulsion between like-charged surfaces. When a global constraint is applied so that the charged surfaces are neutralised only by the dissociated ions, while the clusters contribute overall zero charge, even a very small fraction of clustering ions generate strong and long-ranged forces. Moreover, if the cluster fraction increase substantially upon the addition of further salt, then the strength of the surface forces will also increase, although the range remains roughly constant.</description>

      <title>Molecular simulations of phase separation in elastic polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation within polymer networks plays a central role in shaping the structure and mechanics of both synthetic materials and living cells, including the formation of biomolecular condensates within cytoskeletal networks. Previous experiments and theoretical studies indicate that network elasticity can regulate demixing and stabilize finite-sized domains, yet the microscopic origin of this size selection remains elusive. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with implicit solvent to investigate how network architecture controls phase separation and limits domain growth. By systematically varying chain contour length, chain rigidity, and network topology, we uncover that finite domains emerge when intrinsic chain- or network-level length scales, such as persistence length or entanglement length, impose local constraints on coarsening. Further, the size of these finite domains is highly correlated with these microscopic network properties, but depends surprisingly little on bulk elasticity. Taken together, our findings establish a molecular basis for understanding droplet formation in polymer networks, and provide guiding principles for engineering materials and interpreting condensate behavior in cells.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Energy and Momentum between Magnetoactive Surface Microstructure and a Solid Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the physical mechanisms driving directional transport of solid objects by micro-lamellar structures laser-inscribed on the surface of a magnetoactive elastomer (MAE). When subjected to a rotating magnetic field with magnitude of 175 mT and a time period of 0.4 s, the lamellas reorient within a few milliseconds, reaching angular velocities up to 1100 rad/s. This rapid motion is crucial for efficient momentum and energy transfer to objects in contact with the lamellas. The analysis of collisions of a single lamella with a lead ball with a 2.2 mm diameter shows that the lamella can transfer around 50 nJ of energy, propelling the ball to a speed of around 35 mm/s. We show how this value sets the upper limit for the transport speed of the ball on multi-lamellar MAE arrays. We also explain the background of three distinct transport regimes (kicking, pushing, and bouncing modes) observed on these magnetically driven conveyor belts.</description>

      <title>Simulations of inertial liquid-lens coalescence with the pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coalescence of liquid lenses is relevant in various applications, including inkjet printing and fog harvesting. However, the dynamics of liquid-lens coalescence have been relatively underexplored, particularly in the case of liquid lenses with larger contact angles. We numerically investigate the coalescence of low-viscosity liquid lenses by means of the pseudopotential multi-component lattice Boltzmann method over a wide range of contact angles. In two-dimensional simulations, our numerical results on the growth of the bridge height are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements for small contact angles. In addition, by comparing our simulation results with a theoretical approach based on the thin-sheet equations for liquid lenses, we find that the thin-sheet equations accurately capture the bridge-growth dynamics up to contact angles of approximately $\theta &lt; 40^{\circ}$. For the three-dimensional case, the growth of the bridge radius is independent of the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid lenses at the initial stage of growth. The dependency between the growth of the bridge height and the bridge radius exhibits a non-linear to linear transition.</description>

      <title>Bubble-Driven Flow Transitions in Evaporating Active Droplets on Structured Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation of particle-laden droplets on engineered surfaces underpins a wide range of technologies, from printed electronics to biosensing. While the influence of substrate topography on passive particle deposition is well established, the combined effects of active matter dynamics, catalytic gas generation, and surface structuring remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the drying of aqueous droplets containing Janus particles (polystyrene-platinum, PS-Pt) on topographically patterned substrates in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) fuel. The catalytic decomposition of H2O2 produces oxygen bubbles within the droplet, introducing strong, transient hydrodynamic perturbations that compete with evaporation driven capillary flows and contact line interactions. We show that bubble activity alters particle transport, leading to distinct and tunable final morphologies not achievable with passive suspensions. This study demonstrates how bubble-induced flow coupled with substrate topography determines deposition patterns during droplet evaporation. Our findings open a route to harnessing active matter and reaction driven flows for directed particle assembly.</description>

      <title>The Second Gibbs Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances Gibbs seems to suggest that the chemical potential of a crystal nucleus need not be equal to that of the coexisting fluid. In the field, Gibbs's statement has been something of a hot potato. I argue that a consistent treatment of point defects in the critical nucleus is essential for clarifying the meaning of the chemical potential of the nucleus. In the end -- as always -- Gibbs was right.</description>

      <title>Active flow-driven DNA remodeling generates millimeter-scale mechanical oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In living systems, DNA undergoes continuous and rhythmic mechanical remodeling through condensation, looping, and disentangling to regulate gene expression, segregate chromosomes, and guide morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a purely mechanical route to rhythmic DNA reorganization in a minimal active composite of microtubules, kinesin motors, and DNA. We embed a DNA polymer in an active turbulent microtubule-kinesin fluid, creating a self-morphing material. The active flows stretch and entangle the DNA, forming a self-organized viscoelastic network that resists active stresses and affects flow over large length scales. This mechanical feedback loop progressively amplifies velocity correlations and drives a nonequilibrium phase transition tuned by DNA contour length: from disordered flow to synchronized, millimeter-scale oscillations with vortices. We rationalize the phase transition with an active-gel model that predicts a growing length scale and an oscillatory instability emerging from the interplay between activity, orientational order, and self-generated viscoelasticity, rather than chemical signaling. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on system size and activity quantitatively agrees with experiment. Thus, flow-driven DNA remodeling provides a minimal physical route to autonomous, system-spanning oscillations in three dimensions and suggests design principles for programmable soft matter that coordinates, actuates, and reshapes itself.</description>

      <title>Low-Pass Filtering of Active Turbulent Flows to Liquid Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the impact of active systems on their surroundings, we introduce a model that couples an active nematic fluid to an isotropic substrate fluid via friction. We numerically show that as the active layer develops turbulence, the substrate inherits the chaotic behaviour, exhibiting a novel form of turbulence driven by locally generated stochastic forcing from the active layer. In particular, the short-length-scale flow structures in the active layer are filtered out, so the system behaves as a de facto low-pass filter. We derive analytically the transfer function between the two layers and use it to predict the large-q decay of the substrate energy spectrum, and to investigate how tensorial quantities, such as the strain rate and the active stresses, are transmitted between the active layer and the substrate. Our analysis agrees with recent experiments measuring velocity-velocity correlations in mixtures of active and passive microtubules, and it may have implications for traction force microscopy measurements in cellular layers.</description>

Abstract: This review provides an introduction to the essential physics of soft adhesion, including the thermodynamics of adhesion and wetting, the mechanics of contact with deformable materials, and the material properties that most affect interfacial interactions with soft solid gels and elastomers. Throughout, we emphasize both foundational physics and current experimental and theoretical research in these areas.

      <title>Inferring Surface Slip in Active Colloids from Flow Fields Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed motion of active colloids is governed by spatial variations in surface chemistry and interfacial stress, yet these properties remain extremely difficult to measure directly. We introduce a physics-informed neural network framework that infers the slip distribution driving propulsion from partial observations of the surrounding flow. By combining sparse fluid velocity measurements with the Stokes equations and boundary constraints, the method reconstructs both the near-surface slip and the full velocity and pressure fields. Validation against analytical solutions and Boundary Element Method calculations for canonical active colloid models shows quantitative agreement in both unbounded and confined geometries. Crucially, the framework recovers the surface slip even when no flow data are available near the particle, demonstrating that accessible bulk measurements encode the interfacial stresses responsible for active motion. These results establish physics-informed inference as a powerful tool for characterizing and ultimately controlling interfacially driven transport in colloidal active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field theories predict that phase transitions sequentially breaking continuous and discrete symmetries can generate hybrid topological structures in which defects of different dimensionalities merge. We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures.</description>

      <title>Diffusion through complex confining environments: fluctuating triply periodic minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of individual entities through interconnected structures is a process of practical relevance both in biology and technology. Examples are given by diffusive dynamics of molecules in porous structures. In soft environments, this transport can be strongly influenced by fluctuations of the porous structure itself. Here, we focus on triply periodic membrane structures found both in cell organelles and in synthetic amphiphilic systems. We theoretically study the effect of a complex three-dimensional fluctuating environment on the diffusive motion of a test object, using a phase field approach. The rigid spherical test object is energetically forced to not penetrate the membrane. Generally, the pores of the membrane structure can be smaller than the diffusing object. Yet, fluctuations of the membrane can intermittently widen its pores, still allowing for the motion of the larger particles through them. Thus, the object stays trapped for a while inside one cavity formed by the membrane, before an appropriate fluctuation event widens a membrane pore in the right moment so that the object can jump into the next cavity. The process is reflected by a pronounced plateau in the time evolution of the mean squared displacement. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the diffusing object on the deformation of the membrane, which leads to an additional increase in the diffusivity. We think that the described scenario should be directly observable, for instance, in protein diffusion through biological environments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying surfactant adsorption at fluid interfaces by combining X-ray reflection and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adsorption of surfactants to fluid interfaces occurs in daily-life and technological contexts like dish washing and oil spill remediation. The surfactant surface coverage $\Gamma$ governs interface characteristics like tension $\gamma$, viscoelastic properties, and the stability of thin foam films. Directly measuring $\Gamma$ as a function of the bulk concentration $c$ is highly desirable but challenging, particularly for non-ionic surfactants that lack easily detectable labels. Here, we propose a generic approach to deduce the adsorption isotherm $\Gamma(c)$: As a first step, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of surfactant-loaded air/water interfaces with known $\Gamma$ to obtain interfacial electron density profiles. From these profiles, we then compute theoretical X-ray reflectivity curves, which we compare with experimental measurements to find the matching $c$. We focus on two non-ionic surfactants (C$_{12}$EO$_6$} and $\beta$-C$_{12}$G$_2$}) with previously verified force fields to demonstrate how this combined approach of experiments and simulations can determine the adsorption isotherm. By using the equation of state $\gamma(\Gamma)$ from simulations, our results replicate the measured surface tension isotherms $\gamma(c)$.</description>

      <title>From Knots to Crystals: Machine-Learned Potentials for Self-Assembling Topological Solitons in Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knotted fields in classical and quantum systems were long recognized for their non-trivial topologies and particle-like behavior, but practical applications have been limited by the difficulty of stabilizing them. Recently, stable knotted solitonic textures--heliknotons--have been discovered in chiral liquid crystals, forming adaptive crystal assemblies via elastic distortion-mediated interactions. We use machine learning to develop single-site coarse-grained potentials that accurately capture these chiral anisotropic interactions, enabling large-scale simulations beyond the reach of fine-grained methods. Our machine-learned potentials reproduce the experimentally observed assemblies and provide an efficient framework for modeling a wide range of topological textures.</description>

      <title>Surface functionalization modulates collective cell behavior at integer topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living cells establish long-range orientational order through collective alignment, giving rise to topological defects whose functional relevance is increasingly recognized in tissue organization and morphogenesis. Engineered topographical patterns have been used to induce such defects in cell monolayers, mimicking natural biological phenomena. In this work, we investigate the effect of cell-surface adhesion on collective cell dynamics at a vortex integer topological defect imposed by a topographical ring pattern. Adhesion strength is controlled via surface functionalization with poly-D-lysine, fibronectin, or covalently bonded fibronectin, and quantified using atomic force microscopy. As surface chemistry is modified, cell morphology changes from irregular to spindle-like, and two distinct collective modes emerge: weakly adhered cells exhibit strong inward motion, while strongly attached cells move tangentially to the ring. Spindle-shaped cells exhibit higher nematic order and promote the emergence of two +1/2 topological defects in the monolayer. We further characterize collective cell dynamics by analyzing correlation lengths and demonstrate the scaling of number density fluctuations in cell systems.</description>

      <title>Helix alignment, chevrons, and edge dislocations in twist-bend ferroelectric nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore surface alignment and edge dislocations in the recently discovered twist-bend ferroelectric nematic, NTBF, in which the vector of spontaneous polarization follows an oblique helicoidal trajectory around a polar twist-bend axis. In a planar cell, the polar axis aligns at some angle to the rubbing direction to mitigate surface electric charge. We demonstrate that the pseudolayers in planar cells form chevron defects, a hallmark defect of one-dimensionally positionally ordered phases, such as smectic A and smectic C. The polar character of the twist-bend axis prevents the cores of NTBF edge dislocations from splitting into semi-integer disclinations, in stark contrast to dislocations in paraelectric and ferroelectric chiral nematics. The tilt of pseudolayers around the defect core allows us to estimate the elastic penetration length as being close to the pitch of NTBF. Compression/dilation stresses around the core modify the heliconical tilt angle of molecules as evidenced by a substantial variation in local birefringence. The climb of dislocations exhibits high mobility, allowing the system to equilibrate the temperature-dependent pitch. The uncovered properties facilitate the development of NTBF materials for electro-optical applications, such as electrically controlled diffraction lattices and structural colors.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions between condensates in chemically active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of catalytically active droplets in multi-component conserved mixtures affected by noise. Working in the thin interface limit, we analytically determine the state diagram of the system, characterized by multiple dynamical regimes, and verify our findings using numerical simulations. In particular, we show the emergence of a non-reciprocal, chemically-mediated interaction between the droplets, which leads to the formation of (meta-)stable clusters of droplets of different species. We find that the clusters can display self-propulsion in a large part of the parameter space, including regions where the non-reciprocal interactions between the droplets are purely attractive. This surprising feature arises from the non-local nature of the chemical interactions, and points to locality violations as a general mechanism for energy dissipation and emergence of out-of-equilibrium steady states in active matter.</description>

      <title>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller global resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns. These results collectively demonstrate potential advantages of hyperuniformity in network design and motivate further theoretical and experimental exploration of HuPPI networks.</description>

      <title>Droplet mobilization in actuated deformable tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mobilization of an oil droplet in a deformable, actuated constricted tube subjected to two different actuation mechanisms: hydrodynamic actuation (oscillatory body force in the fluid) and dynamic wall actuation (oscillatory traction on the tube walls). Using high-resolution fluid-structure interaction simulations, we analyze the effects of actuation frequency and amplitude on droplet transport through the constriction. Our simulations show that hydrodynamic actuation leads to a monotonic increase in the droplet's mobilization time with increasing actuation frequency, and a decrease with increasing actuation amplitude. In contrast, dynamic wall actuation exhibits a resonance effect-the mobilization time reaches a minimum at a frequency near the tube's resonant frequency. Our study highlights the potential of actuation mechanisms in deformable tubes for precise control of droplet transport in bio-microfluidic applications.</description>

      <title>Inferring Tree Structure with Hidden Traps from First Passage Times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking the movement of tracer particles has long been a strategy for uncovering complex structures. Here, we study discrete-time random walks on finite Cayley trees to infer key parameters such as tree depth and geometric bias toward the root or leaves. By analyzing first passage properties, we show that the first two first-passage-time factorial moments (FPTFMs) uniquely determine the tree structure. However, if the random walker experiences waiting phases -- due to sticky branch walls or presence of traps -- this identification becomes nontrivial. We demonstrate that the generating function of the first passage time (FPT) distribution decomposes into contributions from the waiting time distribution and the random walk without waiting, leading to a nonlinear system of equations relating the factorial moments of the waiting time distribution and the FPTFMs of random walks with and without waiting. For geometrically distributed waiting times, additional moment measurements do not suffice, but unique determination of the structure is achieved by varying initial conditions or fitting the Fourier transform of the FPT distribution to measured data. The latter method remains effective also for power-law waiting time distributions, where higher-order FPTFMs are undefined. These results provide a framework for reconstructing tree-like networks from FPT data, with applications in biological transport and spatial networks.</description>

      <title>Swarms of Large Language Model Agents for Protein Sequence Design with Experimental Validation</title>

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.</description>

Abstract: We present stochastic variants of the exponential time differencing schemes for stiff stochastic differential equations. We derive three explicit schemes that offer better stability compared to Euler-Maruyama and Milstein's method, and achieve strong convergence up to order O(h) in the time step h. We combine these schemes with a pseudo-spectral approach to outline efficient algorithms for simulating stochastic field theories with additive noise. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we study several systems in and out of equilibrium, including Model A, Model B, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We outline procedures for computing physical observables such as the critical exponents, correlation functions, and dynamic linear response, and provide our implementation as open source code.</description>

      <title>Ready-to-Use Polymerization Simulations Combining Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potential with Time-Dependent Bond Boosting for Polymer and Interface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although polymerization and curing reactions govern the performance of advanced materials, their simulation remains challenging owing to the need for accurate, transferable potentials and rarity of chemical events. Conventional reactive force fields such as ReaxFF require system-specific parametrization, while universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) exhibit limited sampling efficiency. This paper introduces a novel simulation framework integrating a uMLIP with a time-dependent bond-boost scheme. The bias potential increases monotonically with time, and the use of a unified parameter set across reaction classes enables consistent acceleration without system-specific tuning. For radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, the proposed framework reproduces characteristic trends, such as linear molecular-weight growth with conversion, initiator-concentration scaling, and relative monomer reactivity trends. For step-growth polycondensation of nylon-6,6, it captures the characteristic sharp increase in molecular weight at high conversion rates, consistent with experimental behavior. For epoxy curing at a copper substrate, it reveals interfacial ring-opening and cross-linking events, consistent with spectroscopic evidence of Cu-O-C bond formation. Overall, coupling uMLIPs with time-dependent bond boost enables practical and transferable simulations of polymerization and curing processes. The proposed framework reliably resolves mechanistic pathways and relative reactivity, offering molecular-level insights into polymer growth and interfacial adhesion.</description>

      <title>Nature of frontier quasi-particle states in nitrogen-base systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding photophysical properties of DNA is important: It can help us elucidate and probe the impact of charges and free radicals in the cellular environment. For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity.</description>

      <title>A theory for coexistence and selection of branched actin networks in a shared and finite pool of monomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular actin structures are continuously turned over while keeping similar sizes. Since they all compete for a shared pool of actin monomers, the question arises how they can coexist in these dynamic steady states. Recently, the coexistence of branched actin networks with different densities growing in a shared and finite pool of purified proteins has been demonstrated in a biomimetic bead assay. However, theoretical work in the context of organelle size regulation has mainly been focused on linear architectures, such as single filaments and bundles, and thus is not able to explain this observation. Here we show theoretically that the local depletion of actin monomers caused by the growth of a branched network naturally gives rise to a negative feedback loop between network density and growth rate, and that this competition is captured by one central equation. A comprehensive bifurcation analysis shows that the theory leads to well-defined steady states even in the case of multiple networks sharing the same pool of monomers, without any need for specific molecular processes. Under increasing competition strength, coexistence is replaced by selection. We also show that our theory is in excellent agreement with spatiotemporal simulations implemented in a finite element framework. In summary, our work suggests that local monomer depletion is the decisive and universal factor controlling growth of branched actin networks.</description>

Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.</description>

      <title>A continuum mechanics approach for the deformation of non-Euclidean origami generated by piecewise constant nematic director fields</title>

Abstract: We merge classical origami concepts with active actuation by designing origami patterns whose panels undergo prescribed metric changes. These metric changes render the system non-Euclidean, inducing non-zero Gaussian curvature at the vertices after actuation. Such patterns can be realized by programming piecewise constant director fields in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) sheets. In this work, we address the geometric design of both compatible reference director patterns and their corresponding actuated configurations. On the reference configuration, we systematically construct director patterns that satisfy metric compatibility across interfaces. We prove the existence and uniqueness of compatible director fields at a vertex for the generic case, up to orthogonal duals. The Gaussian curvature of the actuated vertex is computed based on the compatible director fields. On the actuated configuration, we develop a continuum mechanics framework to analyze the kinematics of non-Euclidean origami. In particular, we fully characterize the deformation spaces of three-fold and four-fold vertices and establish analytical relationships between their deformations and the director patterns. Building on these kinematic insights, we propose rational designs of large director patterns: one based on a quadrilateral tiling with alternating positive and negative actuated Gaussian curvature, and the other combining three-fold and four-fold vertices governed by a folding angle theorem. Remarkably, both designs achieve compatibility in both the reference and actuated states. We also propose a design strategy for active metamaterials based on the periodic non-Euclidean origami.

      <title>Hydrodynamic bend instability of motile particles on a substrate</title>

Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamic bend instabilities in ordered suspensions of active particles is widely observed across diverse living and synthetic systems, and is considered to be governed by dipolar active stresses generated by the self-propelled particles. Here, using linear stability analyses and numerical simulations, we show that a hydrodynamic bend instability can emerge in the absence of any dipolar active stress and solely due to the self-propulsion force acting on polar active units suspended in an incompressible fluid confined to a substrate. Specifically, we show analytically, and confirm in simulations, that a uniformly ordered state develops bend instability above a critical self-propulsion force. Numerical simulations show that a further increase in the self-propulsion strength leads the system towards a disorderly flow state. The results offer a new route for development of hydrodynamic instabilities in two-dimensional self-propelled materials that are in contact with a substrate, with wide implications in layers of orientationally ordered cells and synthetic active particles.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic or algebraic: roughening of an active Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation sets the universality class for growing and roughening of nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation law and nonlocal effects. We argue here that the KPZ equation can be generalized by including a symmetry-permitted nonlocal nonlinear term of active origin that is of the same order as the one included in the KPZ equation. Including this term, the 2D active KPZ equation is stable in some parameter regimes, in which the interface conformation fluctuations exhibit sublogarithmic or superlogarithmic roughness, with nonuniversal exponents, giving positional generalised quasi-long-ranged order. For other parameter choices, the model is unstable, suggesting a perturbatively inaccessible algebraically rough interface or positional short-ranged order. Our model should serve as a paradigmatic nonlocal growth equation.</description>

      <title>Short-range depinning in the presence of velocity-weakening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phenomena including friction and earthquakes are complicated by the joint presence of disorder and non-linear instabilites, such as those triggered by the presence of velocity weakening. In [de Geus and Wyart, Phys. Rev. E 106, 065001 (2022)], we provided a theory for the nucleation of flow and the magnitude of hysteresis, building on recent results on disorder-free systems described by so called rate-and-state descriptions of the frictional interface, and treating disorder perturbatively. This theory was tested for models of frictional interfaces, where long range elastic interactions are present. Here we test it for short-range depinning, and confirm that (i) nucleation is triggered by avalanches, governed by a critical point at some threshold force $f_c$ close to the minimum of the flow curve and that (ii) due to an armouring mechanism by which the elastic manifold displays very little plasticity after a big slip event, very slowly decaying finite size effects dominate the hysteresis magnitude, with an exponent we can relate to other observables.</description>
