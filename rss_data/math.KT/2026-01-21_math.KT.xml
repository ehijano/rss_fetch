      <title>Periodic families in the homology of $GL_n(F_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct infinite families of nonzero classes in $H_d(GL_n(F_2);F_2)$ along lines of the form $d =\frac{2}{3}n +$(constant), thereby showing that the known slope $\frac{2}{3}$-stability for these homology groups are optimal. Using the new stability Hopf algebra perspective of Randal-Williams, our computations in addition recover the slope-$\frac{2}{3}$ stability for $GL_n(Z)$ with coefficients in $F_2$, improve that for $Aut(F_n)$ to $\frac{2}{3}$, and demonstrate that those slopes are optimal. Perhaps of independent interest, we also provide a manual for computing stability Hopf algebras over $F_2$.</description>

      <title>Borcherds products approximating Gersten complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an orthogonal modular variety, we construct a complex which is defined in terms of lattices and elliptic modular forms, which resembles the Gersten complex in Milnor K-theory, and which has a morphism to the Gersten complex of the modular variety by the Borcherds lifting. This provides a formalism for approaching the higher Chow groups of the modular variety by special cycles and Borcherds products. The construction is an incorporation of the theory of Borcherds products and ideas from Milnor K-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we suggest a sufficient condition on the properadic envelope of a quadratic dioperad to be Koszul in terms of twisted associative algebras.
  As a particular new example, we show that the properad of quadratic Poisson structures is Koszul.</description>

      <title>Scalar-rigid submersions are Riemannian products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-rigid maps are Riemannian submersions by works of Llarull, Goette--Semmelmann, and the second named author. In this article we show that they are essentially Riemannian products of the base manifold with a Ricci-flat fiber. As an application we obtain a Llarull-type theorem for non-zero degree maps onto products of manifolds of non-negative curvature operator and positive Ricci curvature with some enlargeable manifold. The proof is based on spin geometry for Dirac operators and an analysis connecting Clifford multiplication with the representation theory of the curvature operator.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity for syntomic cohomology, \'etale cohomology, and algebraic $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove for $n\geq c-1$ that the functor taking an animated ring $R$ to its mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology factors through the functor $R \mapsto R/p^{c(n+2)}$, a phenomenon we term crystallinity for mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology. As an application, we completely and explicitly compute the mod $(p,v_1 ^{p^{n}-1})$ algebraic $K$-theory of $\mathbb Z/p^{k}$ whenever $k \geq n+2$ and $p&gt;2$. As a second application, we deduce crystallinity for the mod $p^c$ syntomic complexes associated to smooth $p$-adic formal schemes, and in particular for the Galois equivariant mod $p^c$ \'etale cohomologies of their adic generic fibers. Finally, we strengthen known $p$-adic convergence theorems for the topological Hochschild homology of ring spectra, and as a result relate crystallinity for algebraic $K$-theory to Lichtenbaum--Quillen theorems.</description>

      <title>Stratification in equivariant Kasparov theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stratification, that is the classification of localizing tensor ideal subcategories by geometric means, in the context of Kasparov's equivariant KK-theory of C*-algebras. We introduce a straightforward countable analog of the notion of stratification by Balmer-Favi supports and conjecture that it holds for the equivariant bootstrap subcategory of every finite group G. We prove this conjecture for groups whose nontrivial elements all have prime order, and we verify it rationally for arbitrary finite groups. In all these cases we also compute the Balmer spectrum of compact objects. In our proofs we use larger versions of the equivariant Kasparov categories which admit not only countable coproducts but all small ones; they are constructed in an Appendix using infinity-categorical enhancements and adapting ideas of Bunke-Engel-Land.</description>

      <title>Hochschild homology and the derived de Rham complex revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.02576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize two objects by universal property: the derived de Rham complex and Hochschild homology together with its Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg (HKR) filtration. This involves endowing these objects with extra structure, built on notions of "homotopy-coherent cochain complex" and "filtered circle action" that we study here. We use these universal properties to give a conceptual proof that the associated graded of the HKR filtration identifies with the derived de Rham complex, as well as to give a new construction of the filtrations on cyclic, negative cyclic, and periodic cyclic homology that relate these invariants to derived de Rham cohomology.</description>

      <title>Transgressions and Chern characters in coarse homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a variety of coarse homology theories and natural transformations between them. We in particular study the commutativity of a square relating analytical and topological transgressions with algebraic and homotopy theoretic Chern characters. Here a transgression is a natural transformation from a coarse homology theory to a functor which factorizes over the Higson corona functor, and a Chern character is a transformation from a $K$-theory like coarse or Borel-Moore type homology theory to an ordinary version.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Polynomials of Calabi Yau Hypersurfaces in Toric Varieties and Lattice Points in Polytope Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

      <title>Spectral Fusion Deformations for Locally Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a deformation framework for $C^*$-algebras equipped with a coaction of a locally compact quantum group, formulated intrinsically at the level of spectral subspaces determined by the coaction. The construction is defined algebraically on a finite spectral core and extended by continuity to a natural Fr\'echet $*$-algebra completion under mild analytic regularity assumptions.
  Deformations are governed by scalar fusion data assigning phases to fusion channels of irreducible corepresentations. Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.
  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups. In particular, the framework exhibits explicit associator-level deformations governed by fusion $3$--cocycles that cannot arise from any dual $2$--cocycle or crossed-product construction.</description>
