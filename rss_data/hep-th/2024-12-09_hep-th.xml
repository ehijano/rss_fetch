      <title>Photon vortex generation from nonlinear Compton scattering in Feynman approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we show calculation of nonlinear Compton scattering with circularly polarized photons in a cylindrical coordinate using Feynman diagram to calculate photon vortex generation in intermediate states considering conservation of angular momentum. We take two different vortex wave functions based on Bessel function for the emitted photon and the electron after emission of the photon, which are the eigenstate of z component of the total angular momentum (zTAM) when a particle propagates along z axis. The result shows that when an electron absorbs N photons a photon vortex with a zTAM = N is predominantly radiated, but there are still very small contributions of photons with a zTAM = (N-1) and (N +1) due to the spin flip of the initial electron. This means even when an electron absorbs only a single photon, the electron may emit a photon vortex of a zTAM of 2 h-bar. However, the numerical calculations show that the contribution of the spin flip is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the dominant radiation. We also discuss the circular polarization for the generated photon vortices.</description>

      <title>Classical-quantum scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the framework recently proposed by Oppenheim et al. to model relativistic quantum fields coupled to relativistic, classical, stochastic fields (in particular, as a model of quantum matter coupled to ``classical gravity''). Perhaps surprisingly, we find that we can define and calculate scattering probabilities which are Lorentz-covariant and conserve total probability, at least at tree level. As a concrete example, we analyze $2 \to 2$ scattering of quantum matter mediated by a classical Yukawa field. Mapping this to a gravitational coupling in the non-relativistic limit, and assuming that we can treat large objects as point masses, we find that the simplest possible ``classical-quantum'' gravity theory constructed this way gives predictions for $2 \to 2$ gravitational scattering which are inconsistent with simple observations of, e.g., spacecraft undergoing slingshot maneuvers. We comment on lessons learned for attempts to couple quantum matter to ``non-quantum'' gravity, or more generally, for attempts to couple relativistic quantum and classical systems.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>

      <title>On higher fermions in supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the generalised geometry formalism provides a new approach to the description of higher-fermion terms in gauged $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions, which does not appeal to supercovariantisation or superspace. We find expressions containing only five higher-fermion terms across the action and supersymmetry transformations, working in the second-order formalism.</description>

      <title>Partially massless spin 2 and supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very existence of partially massless spin 2 supermultiplet tell us that partially massless spin 2 has two natural superpartners: massless spin 3/2 and massive spin 3/2 with some special value of mass. As for any pair of fields connected by global supertransformations there are two natural questions: existence of the self-interaction and possibility to make supertransformations to be local by switching their interaction with massless spin 3/2 gravitino. At first, we consider a self-interaction for the partially massless spin 2 and massive spin 3/2 which may be considered as the first approximation to partially massless supergravity and provide a direct construction of the minimal (i.e. having no more than one derivative) vertex which resembles usual supergravity. Then we consider localization of global supersymmetry which connects partially massless spin 2 with its two possible superpartners -- massless spin 3/2 and massive with special mass value. For the first case we also managed to construct a minimal vertex having no more that one derivative. Again this vertex can be considered as a part of what can be called partially massless $N=2$ supergravity. As for the second case, the corresponding vertex does exist but it has higher derivative terms.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic structure of three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity coupled to spin-3 fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the asymptotic symmetries of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) gravity theory for a higher spin extension of the so-called Maxwell algebra. We propose a generalized set of asymptotic boundary conditions for the aforementioned flat gravity theory and we show that the corresponding charge algebra defines a higher-spin extension of the $\mathfrak{max}$-$\mathfrak{bms}_{3}$ algebra, which in turn corresponds the asymptotic symmetries of the Maxwell CS gravity. We also show that the $\mathfrak{hs}_3\mathfrak{max}$-$\mathfrak{bms}_{3}$ algebra can alternatively be obtained as a vanishing cosmological constant limit of three copies of the $\mathcal{W}_3$ algebra, with three independent central charges.</description>

Abstract: We consider the geometric action formulation for 3d pure gravity with vanishing cosmological constant. We use fermionic localization to compute the exact torus partition function for a constant representative coadjoint orbit of $\widehat{\text{BMS}}_3$. This allows us to discuss its 1-loop exactness.</description>

      <title>Open string field theory in lightcone gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study covariant open bosonic string field theory in lightcone gauge. When lightcone gauge is well-defined, we find two results. First, the vertices of the gauge-fixed action consist of Mandelstam diagrams with stubs covering specific portions of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. This is true regardless of how the vertices of the original covariant string field theory are constructed (e.g. through minimal area metrics, hyperbolic geometry, and so on). Second, the portions of moduli space covered by gauge-fixed vertices are changed relative those covered by the original covariant vertices. The extra portions are supplied through the exchange of longitudinal degrees of freedom in scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Defects and Phases of Higher Rank Abelian GLSMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct defects describing the transition between different phases of gauged linear sigma models with higher rank abelian gauge groups, as well as defects embedding these phases into the GLSMs. Our construction refers entirely to the sector protected by B-type supersymmetry, decoupling the gauge sector. It relies on an abstract characterization of such transition defects and does not involve an actual perturbative analysis. It turns out that the choices that are required to characterize consistent transition defects match with the homotopy classes of paths between different phases. Our method applies to non-anomalous as well as anomalous GLSMs, and we illustrate both cases with examples. This includes the GLSM associated to the resolution of the $A_N$ singularity and one describing the entire parameter space of $N = 2$ minimal models, in particular, the relevant flows between them. Via fusion with boundary conditions, the defects we construct yield functors describing the transport of D-branes on parameter space. We find that our results match with known results on D-brane transport.</description>

      <title>On the $AdS_3$ Virasoro-Shapiro Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider tree-level scattering amplitudes for four string tachyons on $AdS_3 \times {\cal N}$ with pure NSNS fluxes. We show that in a small curvature expansion, properly defined, the amplitudes take the form of a genus zero integral given by the Virasoro-Shapiro integrand with the extra insertion of single valued multiple polylogarithms. This is the same structure as the one found for the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Amplitudes for Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the Hawking spectrum by exponentiating a series of Feynman diagrams describing a scalar field scattering through a collapse background. Our approach is rooted in semiclassical methods of scattering amplitudes which have recently been developed for application to gravitational-wave physics. The diagrams we encounter do not compute a standard amplitude, but rather an in-in generalisation of an amplitude which is closely connected to the Bogoliubov coefficients. We also compute the subdominant one-loop correction in our perturbative approach, analogous to the triangle correction to Schwarzschild scattering. This term can be interpreted as a finite-size correction sensitive to the radius of the black hole.</description>

      <title>A class of Taub-NUT-scalar metrics via Ehlers transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05458v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a class of Taub-NUT metrics in the presence of a scalar field (TNS) by using Ernst equations and potential, as well as using Ehlers transformations on the exact solutions that was recently introduced in Azizallahi et al. (Nucl Phys B 998:116414, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2023.116414, arXiv:2307.09328 [gr-qc], 2023) and Mirza et al. (Eur Phys J C 83:1161, https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-023-12255-7, arXiv:2307.13588 [gr-qc], 2023). Furthermore, we investigate the effective potential, geodesics, topological charge, quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the deflection angle of light in a gravitational lensing for the obtained class of TNS metrics. We also use conformal transformations to generate a new class of exact solutions of the Einstein-conformal-scalar theory by using the obtained TNS solutions as seed metrics. Finally we compare QNMs of the class of exact solutions.</description>

Abstract: This monograph is aiming to serve as a primary introduction to spectral networks, by presenting them and their many applications from the scope of geometry and mathematical physics in a unified way. We do not attempt to treat these two approaches separately but rather provide broad motivation and the necessary background to reach to the frontiers of this fast-evolving field of research, explaining simultaneously the relevant geometric and physical aspects. The targeted audience is researchers and advanced students from either a rather mathematical or physical oriented education who wish to enter the field.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of effective field theories via on-shell methods: the case of axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the renormalization group equations of axion-like particle effective field theories and determine the corresponding anomalous dimensions at one loop via on-shell and unitarity-based methods. The calculation of the phase-space cut-integrals is carried out using different integration methods, among which the double-cut integration via Stokes' theorem proves to be technically simpler. A close comparison between the standard Feynman diagrammatic approach and the unitarity-based method enables us to explicitly verify the reduction of complexity in the latter case, along with a more direct and elegant way to establish a connection among anomalous dimensions of operators that are dual under the CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and GUP-Corrected Hawking Radiation of BTZ Black Holes within Modified Gravity Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and effective potential profiles of massless and rotating BTZ black holes within the frameworks of $f(\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) modified gravity theories, which, while producing similar space-time structures, exhibit variations due to distinct cosmological constants, $\Lambda_m$. We derive wave equations for these black hole perturbations and analyze the behavior of the effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}(r)$ under different values of mass $m$, cosmological constant $\Lambda_m$, and modified gravity parameters $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\gamma$. The findings indicate that increasing mass and parameter values results in a raised potential barrier, implying stronger confinement of perturbations and impacting black hole stability. Incorporating the generalized uncertainty principle, we also study its effect on the thermodynamics of rotating BTZ black holes, demonstrating how GUP modifies black hole radiation, potentially observable in QNM decay rates. Additionally, we investigate the motion of particles through null and timelike geodesics in static BTZ space-time, observing asymptotic behaviors for null geodesics and parameter-dependent shifts in potential for timelike paths. The study concludes that modified gravity parameters significantly influence QNM frequencies and effective potential profiles, offering insights into black hole stability and suggesting that these theoretical predictions may be tested through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Myrzakulov Gravity in Vielbein Formalism: A Study in Weitzenb\"ock Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to understand gravity's role in shaping the universe has led to the exploration of modified gravity theories. One such theory is Myrzakulov gravity, which incorporates both curvature and torsion. In this work, we investigate the effects of torsion within the framework of $f(R,T)$-gravity, a modification of General Relativity that includes both curvature and torsion. We present this theory in the Vielbein formalism, which offers a more flexible, geometric perspective on gravity. This formalism is particularly useful in Weitzenb"ock spacetime, where torsion significantly influences gravitational interactions. Our study aims to extend Myrzakulov's theory and explore its cosmological and astrophysical implications. We examine the effects of torsion on phenomena like black holes, gravitational waves, and neutron stars. These modifications could lead to observable deviations in black hole thermodynamics, gravitational wave propagation, and dense matter structure. This work provides new insights into the nature of spacetime and gravity, offering a fresh perspective on the fundamental forces governing the cosmos. It paves the way for future studies, both observational and theoretical, that could reveal new physics beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems, and associated phenomena, such as measurement-induced phase transitions, have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. To this end, we study the effects of continuous weak measurements and feedback control on isolated JJAs in the absence of any external thermal bath. The monitoring due to combined effect of measurements and feedback, inducing non-unitary evolution and dissipation, leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering the semiclassical, strong measurement/feedback and weak-coupling limits, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The SYK charging advantage as a random walk on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charging dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models as quantum batteries, highlighting their capacity to achieve quantum charging advantages. By analytically deriving the scaling of the charging power in SYK batteries, we identify the two key mechanisms underlying this advantage: the use of operators scaling extensively with system size $N$ and the facilitation of operator delocalization by specific graph structures. A novel graph-theoretic framework is introduced in which the charging process is recast as a random walk on a graph, enabling a quantitative analysis of operator spreading. Our results establish rigorous conditions for the quantum advantage in SYK batteries and extend these insights to graph-based SYK models, revealing broader implications for energy storage and quantum dynamics. This work opens avenues for leveraging quantum chaos and complex network structures in optimizing energy transfer processes.</description>

      <title>Enlargement of symmetry groups in physics: a practitioner's guide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wigner's classification has led to the insight that projective unitary representations play a prominent role in quantum mechanics. The physics literature often states that the theory of projective unitary representations can be reduced to the theory of ordinary unitary representations by enlarging the group of physical symmetries. Nevertheless, the enlargement process is not always described explicitly: it is unclear in which cases the enlargement has to be done to the universal cover, a central extension, or to a central extension of the universal cover. On the other hand, in the mathematical literature, projective unitary representations were extensively studied, and famous theorems such as the theorems of Bargmann and Cassinelli have been achieved. The present article bridges the two: we provide a precise, step-by-step guide on describing projective unitary representations as unitary representations of the enlarged group. Particular focus is paid to the difference between algebraic and topological obstructions. To build the bridge mentioned above, we present a detailed review of the difference between group cohomology and Lie group cohomology. This culminates in classifying Lie group central extensions by smooth cocycles around the identity. Finally, the take-away message is a hands-on algorithm that takes the symmetry group of a given quantum theory as input and provides the enlarged group as output. This algorithm is applied to several cases of physical interest. We also briefly outline a generalization of Bargmann's theory to time-dependent phases using Hilbert bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel oscillatory behaviour of the DC conductivity in Weyl semimetals with vacancies has recently been identified, occurring in the absence of external magnetic fields. Here, we argue that this effect has a geometric interpretation in terms of a magnetic-like field induced by an emergent Weyl connection. This geometric gauge field is related to the non-metricity of the underlying effective geometry, which is physically induced by vacancies in the lattice system. Finally, we postulate that the chiral magnetic effect in Weyl semimetals can be affected by the presence of dynamical vacancies.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with event horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the effective field theory of quantum gravity at second order in curvature, we calculate quantum corrections to the metric of gravastars and the closely related dark energy stars. We find that the quantum corrections in the exterior region depend on the equation of state of the gravastar, thus providing an example of quantum gravitational hair. We continue by calculating the induced quantum corrections to the photon sphere and the bending of light rays in the weak field regime. These corrections, albeit Planck scale suppressed, allow in principle to distinguish these objects from black holes observationally.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: the Setup and the Wave Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an approach to QCD evolution based on the sequential Born-Oppenheimer approximations that include higher and higher frequency modes as the evolution parameter is increased. This Born-Oppenheimer renormalization group is a general approach which is valid for the high energy evolution as well as the evolution in transverse resolution scale $Q^2$. In the former case it yields the frequency ordered formulation of high energy evolution, which includes both the eikonal splittings which produce gluons with low longitudinal momentum, and the DGLAP-like splittings which produce partons with high transverse momentum. In this, first paper of the series we lay out the formulation of the approach, and derive the expression for the evolved wave function of a hadronic state. We also discuss the form of the $S$-matrix which is consistent with the frequency ordering.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic matching between past infinity and future infinity: The massless scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matching conditions relating the fields at the future of past null infinity with the fields at the past of future null infinity play a central role in the analysis of asymptotic symmetries and conservation laws in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These matching conditions can be derived from initial data given on a Cauchy hypersurface by integrating forward and backward in time the field equations to leading order in an asymptotic expansion, all the way to future and past null infinities. The standard matching conditions considered in the literature are valid only in the case when the expansion near null infinity (which is generically polylogarithmic) has no dominant logarithmic term.
  This paper is the first in a series in which we derive the matching conditions for a massless scalar field with initial conditions leading to dominant logarithms at null infinity. We prove that these involve the opposite sign with respect to the usual matching conditions. We also analyse the matching of the angle-dependent conserved charges that follow from the asymptotic decay and Lorentz invariance. We show in particular that these are well defined and finite at null infinity even in the presence of leading logarithmic terms provided one uses the correct definitions.
  The free massless scalar field has the virtue of presenting the polylogarithmic features in a particularly clear setting that shows their inevitability, since there is no subtle gauge fixing issue or nonlinear intrincacies involved in the problem. We also consider the case of higher spacetime dimensions where fractional powers of $r$ (odd spacetime dimensions) or subdominant logarithmic terms (even spacetime dimensions) are present. Mixed matching conditions are then relevant. In subsequent papers, we will extend the analysis to the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: CSS, DGLAP and all that</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{one}, we have introduced the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) renormalization group approach to high energy hadronic collisions and derived the BO approximation for the light cone wave function of a fast moving projectile hadron. In this second paper, we utilize this wave function to derive the BO evolution of partonic distributions in the hadron -- the gluon transverse momentum and integrated parton distributions (TMD and PDF respectively). The evolution equation for the TMD contains a linear and a nonlinear term. The linear term reproduces the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) equation with a physical relation between the transverse and longitudinal resolution scales. We explain how this equivalence arises, even though the BO and CSS cascades are somewhat different in structures. The nonlinear term in the evolution has a very appealing physical meaning: it is a correction due to stimulated emission, which enhances emission of gluons (bosons) into states with a nonzero occupation.
  For the evolution of the PDF we again find a linear and nonlinear term. At not very small Bjorken $x$, the linear term recovers the DGLAP equation in the leading logarithmic approximation. At small $x$ however there are contributions from gluon splittings which are in the BFKL kinematics leading to a modification of the DGLAP equation. The nonlinear terms have the same physical origin as in the equation for the TMD -- the stimulated emission corrections. Interestingly the nonlinear corrections are the most important for the virtual terms, so that the net correction to the DGLAP is negative and mimics shadowing, although the physical origin of the nonlinearity is very different.</description>

Abstract: We revise the technique of semiclassical effective dynamics, in particular reexamining the evaluation of Poisson structure of the so-called central moments capturing quantum corrections, providing a systematic, pedagogical, and efficient algorithm for evaluation of said structure. The resulting closed formulae for Poisson brackets involve less summatios than recent results in the literature, thus being more optimal for applications. Found formulae are then applied to a general class of isotropic cosmological models with locally observable configuration variables for the admitted matter fields. In particular, this allowed to formulate a consistent and nontrivial limit or fiducial cell (infrared regulator) removal for models describing spatially noncompact spacetimes.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In arXiv:2412.04257 [gr-qc] we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories with a one-form symmetry in the $A$-model formalism on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$. We explicitly compute expectation values of topological line operators that implement the one-form symmetry. This allows us to compute the topologically twisted index on the closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g$ for any real compact gauge group $G$ as long as the ground states are all bosonic. All computations are carried out in the effective $A$-model on $\Sigma_g$, whose $S^1$ ground states are the so-called Bethe vacua. We discuss how the 3d one-form symmetry acts on the Bethe vacua, and also how its 't Hooft anomaly constrains the vacuum structure. In the special case of the $SU(N)_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory, we obtain results for the $(SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_r)^{\theta}_K$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories, for all non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_r \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N$ subgroups of the centre of the gauge group, and with a $\mathbb{Z}_r$ $\theta$-angle turned on. In the special cases with $N$ even, $\frac{N}{r}$ odd and $\frac{K}{r}$ even, we find a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between gravity and the $\mathbb{Z}_r^{(1)}$ one-form symmetry of the $SU(N)_K$ theory, and the infrared 3d TQFT after gauging is spin. In all cases, we count the Bethe states and the higher-genus states in terms of refinements of Jordan's totient function. This counting gives us the twisted indices if and only if the infrared 3d TQFT is bosonic. Our results lead to precise conjectures about integrality of indices, which appear to have a strong number-theoretic flavour. Note: this paper directly builds upon unpublished notes by Brian Willett from 2020.</description>

      <title>Duality Constraints on Thermal Spectra of 3d Conformal Field Theories and 4d Quasinormal Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal spectra of correlation functions in holographic 3d large-N conformal field theories (CFTs) correspond to quasinormal modes of classical gravity and other fields in asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. Using general properties of such spectra along with constraints imposed by the S-duality (or the particle-vortex duality), we derive a spectral duality relation that all such spectra must obey. Its form is universal in that each such relation (expressed as an infinite product over QNMs) only depends on a single function of a spatial wavevector that corresponds to the bulk algebraically special frequencies. In the process, we also derive a new sum rule constraining products over QNMs. The spectral duality relation, which imposes an infinite set of constraints on the QNMs, is then investigated and a number of well-known holographic examples that demonstrate its validity are examined. Our results also allow us to understand several new aspects of the pole-skipping phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the entanglement entropy between the Black 0-Brane solution to supergravity and its Hawking radiation. The Black 0-Brane admits a dual Gauge theory description in terms of the Matrix model for M-Theory, named BFSS theory, which is the theory of open strings on a collection of N D0-branes. Recent studies of the model have highlighted a mechanism of Black Hole evaporation for this system, based on the chaotic nature of the theory and the existence of flat directions. This paper further explores this idea, through the computation of the von Neumann entropy of Hawking radiation. In particular, we show that the expected Page curve is indeed reproduced, consistently with a complete recovery of information after the Black Hole has fully evaporated. A pivotal step in the computation is the definition of a Hilbert space which allows for a quantum mechanical description of partially evaporated Black Holes. We find that the entanglement entropy depends on the choice of a parameter, which can be interpreted as summarizing the geometric features of the Black Hole, such as the size of the resolved singularity and the size of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Emission of Charges from Near-Extremal Charged Nariai Black Holes. II. Rotation Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kerr-Newman black holes in a de Sitter (dS) space have the limit of rotating Nariai black holes with the near-horizon geometry of a warped ${\rm dS}_3 \times {\rm S}^1/Z_2$ when the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon coincide or approach close to each other. We study the rotation effect on the spontaneous emission of charges in the near-extremal rotating charged Nariai black hole and compare it to those from the near-extremal Nariai black hole in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{110}, 085020 (2024) and near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole in de Sitter space in Eur. Phys. J. C \textbf{83}, 219 (2023). In strong contrast to the near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole in dS space, the near-extremal rotating Nariai black hole also has an exponential amplification for the emission of high energy charges, which becomes catastrophic regardless of angular momentum when two horizons coincide. The radius of rotating Nariai black holes monotonically increases as the angular momentum and charge of black holes increase, which gives a weaker electric field on the horizon than Nariai black holes. Thus the angular momentum of black holes that drags particles on the horizon decreases the mean number of charges by a factor not by an order. We observe a catastrophic emission of boson condensation for charges with an effective energy equal to the chemical potential in the spacelike outer region of the cosmological horizon. Remarkably, the Schwinger emission of charges in the standard particle model may prevent the rotating Nariai black holes from evolving into spacetimes with a naked singularity when the angular momentum is close to the allowed maximum, which Nariai black holes cannot avoid.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion in conformal field theory with W-symmetry and the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ODE/IM correspondence between two-dimensional $WA_{r}$/$WD_{r}$-type conformal field theories and the higher-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) obtained from the affine Toda field theories associated with $A_r^{(1)}/D_r^{(1)}$-type affine Lie algebras. We calculate the period integrals of the WKB solution to the ODE along the Pochhammer contour, where the WKB expansions correspond to the classical conserved currents of the Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies. We also compute the integrals of motion for $WA_{r}$($WD_{r}$) algebras on a cylinder. Their eigenvalues on the vacuum state are confirmed to agree with the period integrals up to the sixth order. These results generalize the ODE/IM correspondence to higher-order ODEs and can be used to predict higher-order integrals of motion.</description>

Abstract: We examine the color-kinematics duality within the BV formalism, highlighting its emergence as a feature of specific gauge-fixed actions. Our goal is to establish a general framework for studying the duality while investigating straightforward examples of off-shell color-kinematics duality. In this context, we revisit Chern-Simons theory as well as introduce new examples, including BF theory and 2D Yang-Mills theory, which are shown to exhibit the duality off-shell. We emphasize that the geometric structures responsible for flat-space color-kinematics duality appear for general curved spaces as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretic methods have led to significant advances in nonperturbative quantum field theory in flat space. In this work, we show that these ideas can be generalized to field theories in a fixed de Sitter space. Focusing on 1+1-dimensional field theories, we derive a boosted strong subadditivity inequality in de Sitter, and show that it implies a C-theorem for renormalization group flows. Additionally, using the relative entropy, we establish a Lorentzian bound on the entanglement and thermal entropies for a field theory inside the static patch. Finally, we discuss possible connections with recent developments using unitarity methods.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping string models with entanglement minimization and Machine-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to bootstrapping string-like theories by exploiting a local crossing symmetric dispersion relation and field redefinition ambiguities. This approach enables us to use mass-level truncation and to go beyond the dual resonance hypothesis. We consider both open and closed strings, focusing mainly on open tree-level amplitudes with integer-spaced spectrum, and two leading Wilson coefficients as inputs. Using entanglement minimization in the form of the minimum of the first finite moment of linear entropy or entangling power, we get an excellent approximation to the superstring amplitudes, including the leading and sub-leading Regge trajectories. We find other interesting S-matrices which do not obey the duality hypothesis, but exhibit a transition from Regge behaviour to power law behaviour in the high energy limit. Finally, we also examine Machine-Learning techniques to do bootstrap and discuss potential advantages over the present approach.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an exotic 7-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere, one of Milnor's exotic $7$-spheres. We focus on a Kaluza-Klein Ansatz, with a round $S^4$ as base space, unit $S^3$ as fibre, and $k=1,2$ $SU(2)$ instantons as gauge fields, where all quantities admit an elegant description in quaternionic language. The metric's moduli space coincides with the $k=1,2$ instantons' moduli space quotiented by the isometry of the base, plus an additional $\mathbb{R}^+$ factor corresponding to the radius of the base, $r$. We identify a "center" of the $k=2$ instanton moduli space with enhanced symmetry. This $k=2$ solution is used together with the maximally symmetric $k=1$ solution to obtain a metric of maximal isometry, $SO(3)\times O(2)$, and to explicitly compute its Ricci tensor. This allows us to put a bound on $r$ to ensure positive Ricci curvature, which implies various energy conditions for an $8$-dimensional static space-time. This construction then enables a concrete examination of the properties of the sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Holographic Generalised Gukov-Witten Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spindle and disc solutions have received significant attention in recent literature. However, it is not entirely clear what these supergravity solutions represent in the dual SCFT. In this work we elucidate this issue by considering a different global completion of the spindle solution, focusing on a single conical defect. We argue that these solutions can be interpreted as the insertion of a single (generalised) Gukov-Witten defect in the bulk SCFT. We give compelling evidence for this claim by uplifting the solutions to type IIB supergravity and showing that the five-dimensional $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS solutions uplifts to the bubbling surface operators solutions. Their less supersymmetric cousins give rise to a large class of holographic generalised Gukov-Witten surface operators for which we perform a detailed geometric analysis. To corroborate these claims we compute a variety of holographic observables such as the renormalised action, stress tensor one-point function and defect entanglement entropy. In addition, we extend the holographic inflow mechanism to account for bulk-to-defect inflow to study the symmetries and anomalies of the bulk and defect.</description>

Abstract: We discuss unusual $\theta$ terms that can appear in field theories that allow global vortices. These `Cheshire $\theta$ terms' induce Aharonov-Bohm effects for some particles that move around vortices. For example, a Cheshire $\theta$ term can appear in QCD coupled to an axion and induces Aharonov-Bohm effects for baryons and leptons moving around axion strings.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.07066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a testable alternative to inflation directly built in a very general class of ultraviolet complete theories of quantum gravity enjoying Weyl invariance. After the latter is spontaneously broken, logarithmic quantum corrections to the action make both the primordial tensor spectrum (from graviton fluctuations) and the scalar spectrum (from thermal fluctuations) quasi scale invariant. We predict a scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ which only depends on two parameters and is consistent with observations, a tensor index $n_{\rm t} =1-n_{\rm s}&gt;0$, and, if the fundamental energy scale of the theory $\Lambda_*=M_{\textrm{Pl}}$ is of order of the Planck mass, a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}\approx 0.01$ detectable by BICEP Array and LiteBIRD in the immediate or near future, respectively, and a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background observable by DECIGO in the further future. From the observational constraint $r_{0.05}&lt;0.036$, we also find the lower bound $\Lambda_*&gt; 8.5\times 10^{10}\,{\rm GeV}$, much stronger than any previous one for this class of theories.</description>

      <title>Hasse Diagrams for Gapless SPT and SSB Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-integrable higher spin Kitaev honeycomb model has an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, which exclusively identifies quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the half-integer spin Kitaev model. But its constraints for the integer-spin Kitaev model are much limited, and even trivially gapped insulators cannot be excluded. The physical implications of exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, especially $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes, in integer-spin models remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state for any spin (both integer and half-integer spin) by constructing exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges. We further show that the conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux can also demonstrate the intriguing spin fractionalization phenomena in the nonabelian topological order phase of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model. Its deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex excitation carries fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum number in the low-energy subspace, which is also an nonabelian anyon. Our exact manifestation of spin fractionalization in an integer-spin model is rather rare in previous studies, and is absent in the Kitaev honeycomb model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that inflation is driven by a scalar field together with a vector field minimally coupled to gravity. By assuming an effective potential that incorporates both fields into the action, we explore two distinct scenarios: one where the fields interact and another where they do not. In this context, we find different analytical solutions to the background scalar-vector fields dynamics during the inflationary scenario considering the slow-roll approximation. Besides, general conditions required for these models of two fields to be realizable are determined and discussed. From the cosmological perturbations, we consider a local field rotation, and then we determine these perturbations (scalar and tensor) during inflation, and we also utilize recent cosmological observations for constraining the parameter-space in these scalar-vector inflationary models.</description>

Abstract: A novel nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) model with two dimensionful parameters is introduced and investigated. Our model obeys the Maxwellian limit and exhibits behaviour similar to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian in the weak field limit. It is shown that the electric field of a point charge in this model has a definite maximum value. Thus, the self-energy of the point charge is finite. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is found to occur in the presence of an external uniform electric field. Causality and unitarity conditions for all background electric fields hold, whereas, for magnetic fields, a restricted domain of validity is found. Moreover, a minimal coupling of Einstein's General Relativity (GR) with this NLE results in solutions of regular black holes or naked singularities, depending on whether the source is a nonlinear magnetic monopole or an electric charge, respectively.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>

Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. I. Time-radial-symmetric metrics</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering three phenomenological, regular tr (time-radial)-symmetric space-times (including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones), featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For all three metrics we find that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by potentially an order of magnitude or more, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is devoted to non-\textit{tr}-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr (non-time-radial)-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs, with the lower edge moving potentially more than an order of magnitude. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16842</link>

Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

Abstract: I review the formalism of patch bosonization of Fermi surfaces, with a focus on the problem of a two-dimensional metal at a quantum critical point. I argue that this formalism is fundamentally inapplicable to the problem, except in synthetic limits. One such limit is the small-$N$ limit, which was already discussed in early studies of the problem; a similar but slightly less unphysical large-$N$ limit is proposed. I show that it is at least formally possible to construct perturbative expansions around these synthetic limits. However, I argue that nonperturbative effects become important when $N\sim1$.</description>
