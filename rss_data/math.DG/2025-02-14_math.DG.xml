      <title>Hyperk\"ahler structures on leaves of hyper-Lie Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its rich structure and close connection with gauge theory, hyperk\"ahler manifolds have attracted increasing interest. Using infinite dimensional hyperk\"ahler reduction, Kronheimer proved that certain adjoint orbits of complexified semisimple Lie algebras admits hyperk\"ahler structures. Later on, Xu obtained a proof for the existence of hyperk\"ahler structures on adjoint orbits of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ from the viewpoint of symplectic geometry. This paper aims to thoroughly investigate and elucidate the key differences as well as the underlying connections between two distinct construction methods.</description>

      <title>Isoparametric foliations and complex structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit representations of complex structures on closed manifolds are valuable, but relatively rare in the literature. Using isoparametric theory, we construct complex structures on isoparametric hypersurfaces with $g=4, m=1$ in the unit sphere, as well as on focal submanifolds $M_+$ of OT-FKM type with $g=4$, $m=2$ and $m=4$ in the definite case. Furthermore, we investigate the existence and non-existence of invariant (almost) complex structures on homogeneous isoparametric hypersurfaces with $g=4$, providing a complete classification of those that admit such structures. Finally, we discuss the geometric properties of the complex structures arising from isoparametric theory.</description>

      <title>On mean curvature flow solitons in the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider soliton solutions of the mean curvature flow in the unit sphere $S^{2n+1}$ moving along the integral curves of the Hopf unit vector field. While such solitons must necessarily be minimal if compact, we produce a non-minimal, complete example with topology $S^{2n-1} \times R$. The example wraps around a Clifford torus $S^{2n-1} \times S^1$ along each end, it has reflection and rotational symmetry and its mean curvature changes sign on each end. Indeed, we prove that a complete 2-dimensional soliton with non-negative mean curvature outside a compact set must be a covering of a Clifford torus. Concluding, we obtain a pinching theorem under suitable conditions on the second fundamental form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of words ``discrete curvature'' is only an apparent contradiction. In this survey we describe curvature notions associated with polygons, polyhedral surfaces, and with abstract polyhedral manifolds. Several theorems about the discrete curvature are stated that repeat literally classical theorems of differential and Riemannian geometry: Theorema Egregium, Gauss--Bonnet theorem, and the Chern--Gauss--Bonnet theorem among the others. Some convergence results are also mentioned: under certain assumptions the discrete curvature tends to the smooth curvature as a smooth object is approximated by polyhedral ones.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for free boundary hypersurfaces in initial data sets with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present several rigidity results for compact free boundary hypersurfaces in initial data sets with boundary. Specifically, in the first part of the paper, we extend the local splitting theorems from [G. J. Galloway and H. C. Jang, Some scalar curvature warped product splitting theorems, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 148 (2020), no. 6, 2617-2629] to the setting of manifolds with boundary. To achieve this, we build on the approach of the original paper, utilizing results on free boundary marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) applied to specific initial data sets. In the second part, we extend the main results from [A. Barros and C. Cruz, Free boundary hypersurfaces with non-positive Yamabe invariant in mean convex manifolds, J. Geom. Anal. 30 (2020), no. 4, 3542-3562] to the context of free boundary MOTS in initial data sets with boundary.</description>

      <title>Analysis of different Mathematical Models for Different Case Studies Using Statistical Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curve fitting is a fundamental technique in engineering and scientific research, serving as a critical tool for extracting insights from data. This study explores the application of various statistical equations to estimate outcomes in three distinct case studies: population dynamics, temperature variations within buildings, and market equilibrium prices. The efficacy of each fitting is evaluated through rigorous error criteria, including Sum of Squares Error (SSE), R-squared (R), Degrees of Freedom Error (DFE), Adjusted R-squared (Adj. R), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Our findings reveal that the selection of mathematical functions and the order of equations are contingent upon the specific nature of the model being analyzed. In the first case study concerning population dynamics, a fractional exponential function emerges as the optimal equation. Conversely, the second and third case studies, which focus on temperature fluctuations in buildings and market price equilibrium, respectively, find the best fit with a sinusoidal function employing three terms. Additionally, we compare the fitted curves and empirical equations with experimental data from the literature to comprehensively assess their predictive accuracy. By establishing the most suitable mathematical models for diverse case studies, researchers and practitioners can enhance their ability to make accurate predictions and informed decisions.</description>

      <title>Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curve, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to illustrate the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then illustrate the applications of this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

Abstract: We construct for each conformal structure on a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2 a proper slice in the character variety of representations of the associated surface group into SL(3,R) that belongs to the Barbot component and show that the corresponding representations are Borel Anosov. We describe a fibered geometric structure in the space of full flags associated with these representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1705.11025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that we have a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ with a very ample line bundle $\mathcal{L}$. We prove that any positive definite hermitian form on the space $H^0 (X,\mathcal{L})$ of holomorphic sections can be written as an $L^2$-inner product with respect to an appropriate hermitian metric on $\mathcal{L}$. We apply this result to show that the Fubini--Study map, which associates a hermitian metric on $\mathcal{L}$ to a hermitian form on $H^0 (X,\mathcal{L})$, is injective.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematical way of constructing S-Ricci flat graphs which are not Abelian Cayley via graph bundle with explicit examples. For this purpose, we prove that, with some natural constrains, a non-trivial graph bundle can not be isomorphic (as graphs) to the product of the base graph and fiber graph. It stands in clear contrast to the continuous case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and classify all polynomial growth solutions to certain drift-harmonic equations on complete manifolds with paraboloidal asymptotics. These encompass the natural drift-harmonic equations on certain steady gradient Ricci solitons. Specifically, we show that all drift-harmonic functions with polynomial growth asymptotically separate variables, and compute the dimensions of spaces of drift-harmonic functions with a given polynomial growth rate. The proof uses an inductive argument that alternates between constructing and asymptotically controlling drift-harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Connections on a principal Lie groupoid bundle and representations up to homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Lie groupoid principal $\mbbX$ bundle is a surjective submersion $\pi\colon P\to M$ with an action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $P$ with certain additional conditions. This paper offers a suitable definition for the notion of a connection on such bundles. Although every Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X}$ has its associated Lie algebroid $A:=1^*\ker ds\to X_0$, it does not admit a natural action on its Lie algebroid. There is no natural action of $\mathbb{X}$ on $TP$ either. Choosing a connection $\mathbb{H}\subset TX_1$ on the Lie groupoid $\mathbb{X},$ and considering its induced action up to homotopy of $\mathbb{X}$ on graded vector bundle $TX_0\oplus A,$ we prove the existence of a short exact sequence of diffeological groupoids over the discrete category $M$ (with appropriate vector space structures on the fibres) for the $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M.$ We introduce a notion of connection on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M,$ and show that such a connection $\omega$ splits the sequence. Finally, we show that a connection pair $(\omega, \mathbb{H})$ on $\mbbX$ bundle $\pi\colon P\to M$ is isomorphic to any other connection pair.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many distinct hypersurfaces with prescribed mean curvature (PMC) for a large class of prescribing functions when $(M^{n+1}, g)$ is a closed smooth manifold containing a minimal surface that is strictly stable (or more generally, admits a contracting neighborhood). In particular, we construct infinitely many distinct PMCs when $H_n(M, \mathbb{Z}_2) \neq 0$, or if $(M, g)$ does not satisfy the Frankel property. Our construction synthesizes ideas from Song's construction of infinitely many minimal surfaces in the non-generic setting, Dey's construction of multiple constant mean curvature surfaces, and Sun--Wang--Zhou's min-max construction of free boundary PMCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10193v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-dependent compactification of extra dimensions. We assume that the spacetime is spatially homogeneous, and solve the vacuum Einstein equations without cosmological constant in more than three dimensions. We consider globally hyperbolic spacetimes in which almost Abelian Lie groups act on the spaces isometrically and simply transitively. We give left-invariant metrics on the spaces and solve Ricci-flat conditions of the spacetimes. In the four-dimensional case, our solutions correspond to the Bianchi type II solution. By our results and previous studies, all spatially homogeneous solutions whose spaces have zero-dimensional moduli spaces of left-invariant metrics are found. For the simplest solution, we show that each of the spatial dimensions cannot expand or contract simultaneously in the late-time it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of an extremal horizon in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory must admit a Killing vector field or is static. This implies that any such horizon must be an extremal Kerr-Newman horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant.</description>
