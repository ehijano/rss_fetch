      <title>A Mechanistic Framework for in Silico Optimization of Neuroblastoma Chemo-Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical need exists for optimal therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma, a prevalent and often fatal pediatric solid malignancy. To address the demand for quantitative models that can guide clinical decision-making, a novel mathematical framework was developed. Combination therapies involving immunotherapy, such as Interleukin-2 (IL-2), and chemotherapy, exemplified by Cyclophosphamide, have shown significant clinical potential by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. In this study, a nonlinear system of coupled ordinary differential equations was formulated to mechanistically describe the interactions among tumor cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The pharmacodynamic effects of both IL-2 and Cyclophosphamide on these key immune populations were explicitly incorporated, allowing for the simulation of tumor dynamics across distinct patient risk profiles. The resulting computational framework provides a robust platform for the \textit{\textbf{in silico}} \textbf{optimization} of therapeutic regimens, presenting a quantitative pathway toward the improvement of clinical outcomes for patients with neuroblastoma.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Dynamics of Acid Resistance in Tumors: A Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acidosis in tumors arises from reprogrammed metabolism and compromised vasculature, creating a harsh, acidic microenvironment that drives the evolutionary selection of acid-resistant cell phenotypes. A mathematical model is proposed to integrate phenotypic evolution, microenvironmental acidification, and tumor density dynamics. Three key mechanisms are incorporated in it: frequency-dependent selection favoring acid-resistant cells below a critical pH, stress-induced phenotypic switching, and a positive feedback loop where resistant cells produce excess acid that intensifies selection pressure. The well-posedness of the model is established. Through numerical simulations across biologically relevant parameter regimes, we identify two therapeutically targetable parameters: baseline acid clearance rate (a proxy for vascular perfusion) and a protection factor (representing acid-resistance "machinery" effectiveness) as critical bifurcation parameters for resistance evolution. The model exhibits qualitatively distinct dynamics depending on phenotypic plasticity levels. In low-plasticity tumors, both parameters exhibit sharp bifurcations with strong parameter interactions: clearance and protection effects are context-dependent, with therapeutic interventions effective only within specific parameter ranges. In high-plasticity tumors, both parameters produce continuous, monotonic responses with independent, additive effects. These regime-dependent dynamics suggest that treatment strategies should adapt to tumor plasticity: in the formar, targeting perfusion alone is typically sufficient, though sequential therapy may be required if the perfusion rate approaches or exceeds the bifurcation threshold, whereas in the latter treatment might benefit from combination therapies addressing both parameters simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised whole-heart function assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: CMR is the golden standard for cardiac diagnosis, and medical data annotation is time-consuming. Thus, screening techniques from unlabeled data can help streamline the cardiac diagnosis process.
  Goal: This work aims to enable cardiac function assessment from unlabeled cardiac MR images using an unsupervised approach with masked image modeling.
  Approach: Our model creates a robust latent space by reconstructing sparse 2D+T planes (SAX, 2CH, 3CH, and 4CH views) with 70\% masking, which can be further disentangled into distinct cardiac temporal states.
  Results: t-SNE visualization and kNN clustering analysis confirm the association between latent space and cardiac phenotypes, highlighting strong temporal feature extraction.
  Impact: This method offers a scalable approach for cardiac screening by creating a latent space as well as distinct time-segment embeddings, enabling diverse preliminary analysis of cardiac function and potentially advancing research in cardiovascular disease applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of menopause from deconvolution of millions of lab tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Menopause reshapes female physiology, yet its full temporal footprint is obscured by uncertainty in the age of the final menstrual period (FMP). Here we analyse cross-sectional data on 300 million laboratory tests from more than a million women in two population-scale cohorts (Israel-Clalit and US-NHANES). We apply a deconvolution algorithm inspired by astronomical image "de-blurring" to align each test to time-from-FMP rather than chronological age. Nearly every assay - spanning endocrine, bone, hepatic, lipid, osmolality, inflammatory and muscular systems - exhibits a jump at FMP that is absent in males and highly concordant between cohorts. Jumps were largest in the sex hormones, followed by bone, toxins, red blood cells, liver, iron, lipids, kidney, and muscle. Changes are mostly detrimental except iron indices and anemia that improve post-menopause, and depression scores that spike only transiently. Hormone-replacement therapy attenuates many of the step-like changes. Sex hormone dysregulation occurs more than 10 years prior to FMP. These findings reveal the step-like dysregulation across physiology caused by loss of sex hormones and establish deconvolution as a general strategy for disentangling age-related transitions in large, noisy datasets.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Learning-based Classification of Wolff-Parkinson-White Electrocardiographic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.</description>
