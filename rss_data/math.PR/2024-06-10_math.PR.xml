      <title>Phase transition of the consistent maximal displacement of branching Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider branching Brownian motion in which we begin with one particle at the origin, particles independently move according to Brownian motion, and particles split into two at rate one. It is well-known that the right-most particle at time $t$ will be near $\sqrt{2} t$. Roberts considered the so-called consistent maximal displacement and showed that with high probability, there will be a particle at time $t$ whose ancestors stayed within a distance $ct^{1/3}$ of the curve $s \mapsto \sqrt{2} s$ for all $s \in [0, t]$, where $c = (3 \pi^2)^{1/3}/\sqrt{2}$. We consider the question of how close the trajectory of a particle can stay to the curve $s \mapsto (\sqrt{2} + \varepsilon) s$ for all $s \in [0, t]$, where $\varepsilon&gt; 0$ is small. We find that there is a phase transition, with the behavior changing when $t$ is of the order $\varepsilon^{-3/2}$. This result allows us to determine, for branching Brownian motion in which particles have a drift to the left of $\sqrt{2} + \varepsilon$ and are killed at the origin, the position at which a particle needs to begin at time zero for there to be a high probability that the process avoids extinction until time $t$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative instability for stochastic scalar reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the instability of stochastic scalar reaction diffusion equations, driven by a multiplicative noise that is white in time and smooth in space, near to zero, which is assumed to be a fixed point for the equation. We prove that if the Lyapunov exponent at zero is positive, then the flow of non-zero solutions admits uniform bounds on small negative moments. The proof builds on ideas from stochastic homogenisation. We require suitable corrector estimates for the solution to a Poisson problem involving an infinite-dimensional projective process, together with a linearisation step that hinges on quantitative parametrix-like arguments. Overall, we are able to construct an appropriate Lyapunov functional for the nonlinear dynamics and address some problems left open in the literature.</description>

      <title>Expected Lipschitz-Killing curvatures for spin random fields and other non-isotropic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical spin random fields are used to model the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization, the study of which is at the heart of modern Cosmology and will be the subject of the LITEBIRD mission, in the 2030s. Its scope is to collect datas to test the theoretical predictions of the Cosmic Inflation model. In particular, the Minkowski functionals, or the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, of excursion sets can be used to detect deviations from Gaussianity and anisotropies of random fields, being fine descriptors of their geometry and topology.
  In this paper we give an explicit, non-asymptotic, formula for the expectation of the Lipshitz-Killing curvatures of the excursion set of the real part of an arbitrary left-invariant Gaussian spin spherical random field, seen as a field on $SO(3)$. Our findings are coherent with the asymptotic ones presented in Carr\'on Duque, J. et al. "Minkowski Functionals in $SO(3)$ for the spin-2 CMB polarisation field", Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (2024). We also give explicit expressions for the Adler-Taylor metric, and its curvature. We obtain such result as an application of a general formula that applies to any nondegenerate Gaussian random field defined on an arbitrary three dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. The novelty is that the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures are computed with respect to an arbitrary metric, possibly different than the Adler-Taylor metric of the field.</description>

      <title>Mean field stable matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the complete bipartite graph on $n+n$ vertices where the edges are equipped with i.i.d. exponential costs. A matching of the vertices is stable if it does not contain any pair of vertices where the connecting edge is cheaper than both matching costs. There exists a unique stable matching obtained by iteratively pairing vertices with small edge costs. We show that the total cost $C_{n,n}$ of this matching is of order $\log n$ with bounded variance, and that $C_{n,n}-\log n$ converges to a Gumbel distribution. We also show that the typical cost of an edge in the matching is of order $1/n$, with an explicit density on this scale, and analyze the rank of a typical edge. These results parallel those of Aldous for the minimal cost matching in the same setting. We then consider the sensitivity of the matching and the matching cost to perturbations of the underlying edge costs. The matching itself is shown to be robust in the sense that two matchings based on largely identical edge costs will have a substantial overlap. The matching cost however is shown to be noise sensitive, as a result of the fact that the most expensive edges will with high probability be replaced after resampling. Our proofs also apply to the complete (unipartite) graph and the results in this case are qualitatively similar.</description>

      <title>Meeting times of Markov chains via singular value decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a non-asymptotic matrix perturbation-theoretic approach to get sharp bounds on the expected meeting time of random walks on large (possibly random) graphs. We provide a formula for the expected meeting time in terms of the singular value decomposition of the diagonally killed generator of a pair of independent random walks, which we view as a perturbation of the generator. Employing a rank-one approximation of the diagonally killed generator as the proof of concept, we work out sharp bounds on the expected meeting time of simple random walks on sufficiently dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dispersion process on the complete graph introduced in the recent work \cite{de_dispersion_2023} under the mean-field framework. In contrast to the probabilistic approach taken in \cite{de_dispersion_2023} and many other related works, our focus is on the investigation of the large time behavior of solutions of the associated kinetic mean-field system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We establish various analytical and quantitative convergence results for the long time behaviour of the mean-field system and related numerical illustrations are also provided.</description>

      <title>Winner-takes-all learners are geometry-aware conditional density estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Winner-takes-all training is a simple learning paradigm, which handles ambiguous tasks by predicting a set of plausible hypotheses. Recently, a connection was established between Winner-takes-all training and centroidal Voronoi tessellations, showing that, once trained, hypotheses should quantize optimally the shape of the conditional distribution to predict. However, the best use of these hypotheses for uncertainty quantification is still an open question.In this work, we show how to leverage the appealing geometric properties of the Winner-takes-all learners for conditional density estimation, without modifying its original training scheme. We theoretically establish the advantages of our novel estimator both in terms of quantization and density estimation, and we demonstrate its competitiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets, including audio data.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Policies for Weakly Coupled Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing the expected average reward obtained over an infinite time horizon by $n$ weakly coupled Markov decision processes. Our setup is a substantial generalization of the multi-armed restless bandit problem that allows for multiple actions and constraints. We establish a connection with a deterministic and continuous-variable control problem where the objective is to maximize the average reward derived from an occupancy measure that represents the empirical distribution of the processes when $n \to \infty$. We show that a solution of this fluid problem can be used to construct policies for the weakly coupled processes that achieve the maximum expected average reward as $n \to \infty$, and we give sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions. Under certain assumptions on the constraints, we prove that these conditions are automatically satisfied if the unconstrained single-process problem admits a suitable unichain and aperiodic policy. In particular, the assumptions include multi-armed restless bandits and a broad class of problems with multiple actions and inequality constraints. Also, the policies can be constructed in an explicit way in these cases. Our theoretical results are complemented by several concrete examples and numerical experiments, which include multichain setups that are covered by the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Neural Laplace for learning Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Laplace is a unified framework for learning diverse classes of differential equations (DE). For different classes of DE, this framework outperforms other approaches relying on neural networks that aim to learn classes of ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, many systems can't be modelled using ODEs. Stochastic differential equations (SDE) are the mathematical tool of choice when modelling spatiotemporal DE dynamics under the influence of randomness. In this work, we review the potential applications of Neural Laplace to learn diverse classes of SDE, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>

Abstract: A sequence $d_1\le\cdots\le d_n$ is graphical if it is the degree sequence of a graph. Balister, the second author, Groenland, Johnston and Scott showed that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{3/4}$ such sequences. However, the constant $C$ involves a probability that is only approximated. Using random walks and limit theory for infinitely divisible probability distributions, we describe $C$ in terms of Walkup's formula for the number of rooted, unlabelled and cyclically distinct plane trees.</description>

Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for a one dimensional harmonic chain with a random flip of the momentum sign. The system is open and subject to two thermostats at the boundaries and to an external tension at one of the endpoints. Under a diffusive scaling of space-time, we prove that the empirical profiles of the two locally conserved quantities, the volume stretch and the energy, converge to the solution of a non-linear diffusive system of conservative partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Estimates for the empirical distribution along a geodesic in first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.08072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In first-passage percolation, we assign i.i.d.~nonnegative weights $(t_e)$ to the nearest-neighbor edges of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and study the induced pseudometric $T = T(x,y)$. In this paper, we focus on geodesics, or optimal paths for $T$, and estimate the empirical distribution of weights along them. We prove an upper bound for the expected number of edges with weight $\geq M$ in the union of all geodesics from $0$ to $x$ of the form $q(M) \mathbb{P}(t_e \geq M)|x|$, where $q(M) \leq e^{-cM}$. This shows that the tail of the expected empirical distribution along a geodesic is lighter than that of the original weight distribution by an exponential factor. We also give a lower bound for the expected minimal number of edges with weight $\geq M$ in any geodesic from $0$ to $x$ in terms of $\mathbb{P}(t_e \geq M)$ and $\mathbb{P}(t_e \in [M,2M])$. For example, these two imply that if $t_e$ has a power law tail of the form $\mathbb{P}(t_e \geq M) \sim M^{-\alpha}$, then the tail of the expected empirical distribution asymptotically lies between $e^{-CM \log M}$ and $e^{-cM}$. We also provide estimates for the expected number of edges in a geodesic with weight in a set $A$ for (a) arbitrary $A$, (b) $A$ an interval separated from the infimum of the support of $t_e$ and (c) $A=[0,a]$ for some $a \geq 0$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be the adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices, and we denote its eigenvalues by $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\cdots \geq \lambda_{N}$. For $N^{2/3}\ll d\leq N/2$, we prove optimal rigidity estimates of the extreme eigenvalues of $\mathcal A$, which in particular imply that \[ \max\{|\lambda_N|,\lambda_2\} &lt;2\sqrt{d-1} \] with overwhelming probability. In the same regime of $d$, we also show that \[ N^{2/3}\bigg(\frac{\lambda_2+d/N}{\sqrt{d(N-d)/N}}-2\bigg) \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{TW}_1\,, \]where $\mathrm{TW}_1$ is the Tracy-Widom distribution for GOE; analogues results also hold for other non-trivial extreme eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Rearranged Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to provide an explicit construction of a strong Feller semigroup on the space of probability measures over the real line that additionally maps bounded measurable functions into Lipschitz continuous functions, with a Lipschitz constant that blows up in an integrable manner in small time. Our construction relies on a rearranged version of the stochastic heat equation on the circle driven by a coloured noise. Formally, this stochastic equation writes as a reflected equation in infinite dimension. Under the action of the rearrangement, the solution is forced to live in a space of quantile functions that is isometric to the space of probability measures on the real line. We prove the equation to be solvable by means of an Euler scheme in which we alternate flat dynamics in the space of random variables on the circle with a rearrangement operation that projects back the random variables onto the subset of quantile functions. A first challenge is to prove that this scheme is tight. A second one is to provide a consistent theory for the limiting reflected equation and in particular to interpret in a relevant manner the reflection term. The last step in our work is to establish the aforementioned Lipschitz property of the semigroup by adapting earlier ideas from the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula.</description>

      <title>Lozenge Tilings of a Hexagon and q-Racah Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of random lozenge tilings of the hexagon with a q-Racah weight as the size of the hexagon grows large. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the recurrence coefficients of the q-Racah polynomials, we give a new proof for the fact that that the height function for a random tiling concentrates near a deterministic limit shape and that the global fluctuations are described by the Gaussian Free Field. These results were recently proved using (dynamic) loop equation techniques. In this paper we extend the recurrence coefficient approach that was developed for (dynamic) orthogonal polynomial ensembles to the setting of q-orthogonal polynomials. An interesting feature is that the complex structure is easily found from the limiting behavior of the (explicitly known) recurrence coefficients. A particular motivation for studying this model is that the variational characterization of the limiting height function has an inhomogeneous term. The study of the regularity properties of the minimizer for general variation problems with such inhomogeuous terms is a challenging open problem. We show that, in a general setup, the variational problem gives rise to a natural complex structure that is associated to the same Beltrami equation as in the homogeneous situation. We also derive a relation between the complex structure and the complex slope. In case of the q-Racah weighting of lozenge tilings of the hexagon, our representation of the limit shape and their fluctuations in terms of the recurrence coefficients allows us to verify this relation explicitly.</description>

Abstract: We provide a probabilistic representation for the derivative of the semigroup corresponding to a diffusion process killed at the boundary of a half interval. In particular, we show that the derivative of the semi-group can be expressed as the expected value of a functional of a reflected diffusion process. Furthermore, as an application, we obtain a Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula which is also valid at the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the renormalised equation for the quasi-generalised KPZ equation with space-time white noise. We complement the program initiated by Gerencs\'er and Hairer for solving quasi-linear equations using regularity structures by an algebraic machinery that gives a systematic tool to remove non-local counterterms and provide a precise expression of the renormalised equation that is consistent with the semilinear case. The solution theory satisfies the chain rule and a natural notion of It\^o isometry, which can be combined to obtain global in time solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-indices coproducts from ODEs to singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit formulae for the coproducts at play for multi-indices in ODEs and in singular SPDEs. The two coproducts described correspond to versions of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and extraction/contraction coproducts with multi-indices. The main idea is to use the fact that these coproducts are the adjoints of dual products for which one has explicit simple formulae. We are able to derive the explicit formulae via an inner product defined from a symmetry factor easily computable for multi-indices.</description>

      <title>A stochastic algorithm approach for the elephant random walk with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The randomized play-the-winner rule (RPW) is a response-adaptive design proposed by Wei and Durham (1978) for sequentially randomizing patients to treatments in a two-treatment clinical trial so that more patients are assigned to the better treatment as the clinical trial goes on. The elephant random walk (ERW) proposed by Schutz and Trimper (2004) is a non-Markovian discrete-time random walk on $\mathbb Z$ which has a link to a famous saying that elephants can always remember where they have been. The asymptotic behaviors of RPW rule and ERW have been studied in litterateurs independently, and their asymptotic behaviors are very similar. In this paper, we show that the RPW rule is a biased ERW and link them with the recursive stochastic algorithm. With the help of a recursive stochastic algorithm, we obtain the strong invariance principle of the ERW as well as multi-dimensional varying-memory ERW with random step sizes. By the strong invariance principle, the central limit theorem, precise law of the iterated logarithm and almost sure central limit theorem are obtained for both the multi-dimensional ERW, and the multi-dimensional ERW with random step sizes and their centers of mass. The Chung type law of the iterated logarithm of the multi-dimensional ERW is also obtained.</description>

Abstract: We study a statistical model for infinite dimensional Gaussian random variables with unknown parameters. For this model we derive linear estimators for the mean and the variance of the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing. A linear regression problem in infinite dimensions and some perspectives to statistical and machine learning are presented as well.</description>

      <title>Estimation of several parameters in discretely-observed Stochastic Differential Equations with additive fractional noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of joint statistical estimation of several parameters for a stochastic differential equation driven by an additive fractional Brownian motion. Based on discrete-time observations of the model, we construct an estimator of the Hurst parameter, the diffusion parameter and the drift, which lies in a parametrised family of coercive drift coefficients. Our procedure is based on the assumption that the stationary distribution of the SDE and of its increments permits to identify the parameters of the model. Under this assumption, we prove consistency results and derive a rate of convergence for the estimator. Finally, we show that the identifiability assumption is satisfied in the case of a family of fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and illustrate our results with some numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Genetic mutations are footprints of tumour growth. While mutation data in bulk samples has been used to infer evolutionary parameters hard to measure in vivo, the advent of single-cell data has led to strong interest in the mutational burden distribution (MBD) among tumour cells. We introduce dynamical matrices and recurrence relations to integrate this single-cell MBD with known statistics, and derive new analytical expressions. Surprisingly, we find that the shape of the MBD is driven by cell lineage-level stochasticity rather than by the distribution of mutations in each cell division.</description>

      <title>Measuring risk contagion in financial networks with CoVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of a complex financial system may be assessed by measuring risk contagion between various financial institutions with relatively high exposure. We consider a financial network model using a bipartite graph of financial institutions (e.g., banks, investment companies, insurance firms) on one side and financial assets on the other. Following empirical evidence, returns from such risky assets are modeled by heavy-tailed distributions, whereas their joint dependence is characterized by copula models exhibiting a variety of tail dependence behavior. We consider CoVaR, a popular measure of risk contagion and study its asymptotic behavior under broad model assumptions. We further propose the Extreme CoVaR Index (ECI) for capturing the strength of risk contagion between risk entities in such networks, which is particularly useful for models exhibiting asymptotic independence. The results are illustrated by providing precise expressions of CoVaR and ECI when the dependence of the assets is modeled using two well-known multivariate dependence structures: the Gaussian copula and the Marshall-Olkin copula.</description>

      <title>Bordered and Framed Toeplitz and Hankel Determinants with Applications to Integrable Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bordered and framed Toeplitz/Hankel determinants have the same structure as Toeplitz/Hankel determinants except in small number of matrix rows and/or columns. We review these structured determinants and their connections to orthogonal polynomials, collecting well-known and perhaps less well-known results. We present some applications for these structured determinants to ensembles of non-intersecting paths and the six-vertex model, with an eye towards asymptotic analysis. We also prove some asymptotic formulae for the probability of non-intersection for an ensemble of continuous time random walks for certain choices of starting and ending points as the number of random walkers tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Steps of CyclePopping in Weakly Inconsistent U(1)-Connection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A U(1)-connection graph $G$ is a graph in which each oriented edge is endowed with a unit complex number, the latter being conjugated under orientation flip. We consider cycle-rooted spanning forests (CRSFs), a particular kind of spanning subgraphs of $G$ that have recently found computational applications as randomized spectral sparsifiers. In this context, CRSFs are drawn from a determinantal measure. Under a condition on the connection, Kassel and Kenyon gave an elegant algorithm, named CyclePopping, to sample from this distribution. The algorithm is an extension of the celebrated algorithm of Wilson that uses a loop-erased random walk to sample uniform spanning trees. In this paper, we give an alternative, elementary proof of correctness of CyclePopping for CRSF sampling; we fill the gaps of a proof sketch by Kassel, who was himself inspired by Marchal's proof of the correctness of Wilson's original algorithm. One benefit of the full proof \`a la Marchal is that we obtain a concise expression for the law of the number of steps to complete the sampling procedure, shedding light on practical situations where the algorithm is expected to run fast. Furthermore, we show how to extend the proof to more general distributions over CRSFs, which are not determinantal. The correctness of CyclePopping is known even in the non-determinantal case from the work of Kassel and Kenyon, so our merit is only to provide an alternate proof. One interest of this alternate proof is again to provide the distribution of the time complexity of the algorithm, in terms of a Poisson point process on the graph loops, or equivalently as a Poisson process on pyramids of cycles, a combinatorial notion introduced by Viennot. Finally, we strive to make the connections to loop measures and combinatorial structures as explicit as possible, to provide a reference for future extensions of the algorithm and its analysis.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for Gaussian distributions: Exact solutions and Wasserstein errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion or score-based models recently showed high performance in image generation. They rely on a forward and a backward stochastic differential equations (SDE). The sampling of a data distribution is achieved by solving numerically the backward SDE or its associated flow ODE. Studying the convergence of these models necessitates to control four different types of error: the initialization error, the truncation error, the discretization and the score approximation. In this paper, we study theoretically the behavior of diffusion models and their numerical implementation when the data distribution is Gaussian. In this restricted framework where the score function is a linear operator, we can derive the analytical solutions of the forward and backward SDEs as well as the associated flow ODE. This provides exact expressions for various Wasserstein errors which enable us to compare the influence of each error type for any sampling scheme, thus allowing to monitor convergence directly in the data space instead of relying on Inception features. Our experiments show that the recommended numerical schemes from the diffusion models literature are also the best sampling schemes for Gaussian distributions.</description>
