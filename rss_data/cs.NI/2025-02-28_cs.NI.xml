      <title>Harmonious Coexistence between Aloha and CSMA: Novel Dual-channel Modeling and Throughput Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of the licensed spectrum is forcing emerging Internet of Things (IoT) networks to operate within the unlicensed spectrum. Yet there has been extensive observation indicating that performance deterioration and significant unfairness would arise, when newly deployed Aloha-based networks coexist with incumbent Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)-based WiFi networks, especially without proper adjustment of packet transmission times. Therefore, ensuring harmonious cohabitation between Aloha and CSMA networks is of paramount importance. How to properly tune system parameters to guarantee harmonious coexistence between these two networks, nevertheless, remains largely unexplored. To address the above open issue, this paper proposed a novel dual-channel analytical framework to characterize the throughput performance of the cohabitation between slotted Aloha and CSMA networks. To achieve harmonious coexistence, the total throughput of the coexisting network under a given desired throughput proportion is optimized by tuning the packet transmission time of CSMA nodes and transmission probabilities. The optimization results indicate that the packet transmission time of CSMA nodes should be set slightly less than that of Aloha nodes. The proposed framework is further applied to enhance the network throughput and fairness of the cohabitation of LTE Unlicensed and WiFi networks.</description>

      <title>Energy consumption of smartphones and IoT devices when using different versions of the HTTP protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HTTP is frequently used by smartphones and IoT devices to access information and Web services. Nowadays, HTTP is used in three major versions, each introducing significant changes with respect to the previous one. We evaluated the energy consumption of the major versions of the HTTP protocol when used in the communication between energy-constrained devices and cloud-based or edge-based services. Experimental results show that in a machine-to-machine communication scenario, for the considered client devices - a smartphone and a Single Board Computer - and for a number of cloud/edge services and facilities, HTTP/3 frequently requires more energy than the previous versions of the protocol. The focus of our analysis is on machine-to-machine communication, but to obtain a broader view we also considered a client-server interaction pattern that is more browsing-like. In this case, HTTP/3 can be more energy efficient than the other versions.</description>

      <title>Pricing for Routing and Flow-Control in Payment Channel Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A payment channel network is a blockchain-based overlay mechanism that allows parties to transact more efficiently than directly using the blockchain. These networks are composed of payment channels that carry transactions between pairs of users. Due to its design, a payment channel cannot sustain a net flow of money in either direction indefinitely. Therefore, a payment channel network cannot serve transaction requests arbitrarily over a long period of time. We introduce \emph{DEBT control}, a joint routing and flow-control protocol that guides a payment channel network towards an optimal operating state for any steady-state demand. In this protocol, each channel sets a price for routing transactions through it. Transacting users make flow-control and routing decisions by responding to these prices. A channel updates its price based on the net flow of money through it. The protocol is developed by formulating a network utility maximization problem and solving its dual through gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees for the protocol and also illustrate its behavior through simulations.</description>

      <title>ACCORD: Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design for 5G/NextG Machine-centric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI and edge computing have accelerated the development of machine-centric applications (MCAs), such as smart surveillance systems. In these applications, video cameras and sensors offload inference tasks like license plate recognition and vehicle tracking to remote servers due to local computing and energy constraints. However, legacy network solutions, designed primarily for human-centric applications, struggle to reliably support these MCAs, which demand heterogeneous and fluctuating QoS (due to diverse application inference tasks), further challenged by dynamic wireless network conditions and limited spectrum resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design (ACCORD) framework. This innovative framework anticipates the evolving demands of MCAs in real time, quickly adapting to provide customized QoS and optimal performance, even for the most dynamic and unpredictable MCAs. This also leads to improved network resource management and spectrum utilization. ACCORD operates as a closed feedback-loop system between the application client and network and consists of two key components: (1) Building Application Context: It focuses on understanding the specific context of MCA requirements. Contextual factors include device capabilities, user behavior (e.g., mobility speed), and network channel conditions. (2) Cross-layer Network Parameter Configuration: Utilizing a DRL approach, this component leverages the contextual information to optimize network configuration parameters across various layers, including PHY, MAC, and RLC, as well as the application layer, to meet the desired QoS requirement in real-time. Extensive evaluation with the 3GPP-compliant MATLAB 5G toolbox demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed ACCORD framework.</description>

      <title>AutoBS: Autonomous Base Station Deployment Framework with Reinforcement Learning and Digital Twin Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AutoBS, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for optimal base station (BS) deployment in 6G networks. AutoBS leverages the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and fast, site-specific pathloss predictions from PMNet to efficiently learn deployment strategies that balance coverage and capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that AutoBS achieves 95% for a single BS, and 90% for multiple BSs, of the capacity provided by exhaustive search methods while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. AutoBS offers a scalable and automated solution for large-scale 6G networks, addressing the challenges of dynamic environments with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Exploring QUIC Dynamics: A Large-Scale Dataset for Encrypted Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03728v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of the QUIC transport protocol has transformed encrypted web traffic, necessitating new methodologies for network analysis. However, existing datasets lack the scope, metadata, and decryption capabilities required for robust benchmarking in encrypted traffic research. We introduce VisQUIC, a large-scale dataset of 100,000 labeled QUIC traces from over 44,000 websites, collected over four months. Unlike prior datasets, VisQUIC provides SSL keys for controlled decryption, supports multiple QUIC implementations (Chromium QUIC, Facebooks mvfst, Cloudflares quiche), and introduces a novel image-based representation that enables machine learning-driven encrypted traffic analysis. The dataset includes standardized benchmarking tools, ensuring reproducibility. To demonstrate VisQUICs utility, we present a benchmarking task for estimating HTTP/3 responses in encrypted QUIC traffic, achieving 97% accuracy using only observable packet features. By publicly releasing VisQUIC, we provide an open foundation for advancing encrypted traffic analysis, QUIC security research, and network monitoring.</description>

      <title>xApp-Level Conflict Mitigation in O-RAN, a Mobility Driven Energy Saving Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the emerging challenges of conflict detection and mitigation in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). Conflicts between xApps can arise that affect network performance and stability due to the disaggregated nature of O-RAN. This work provides a detailed theoretical framework of Extended Application (xApp)-level conflicts, i.e., direct, indirect, and implicit conflicts. Leveraging conflict graphs, we further highlight how conflicts impact Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and explore strategies for conflict detection using Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) thresholds. We evaluate the effectiveness of several mitigation strategies in a simulated environment with Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) and Energy Saving (ES) xApps and present experimental results showing comparisons among these strategies. The findings of this research provide significant insights for enhancing O-RAN deployments with flexible and efficient conflict management.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Video Analytics in Cloud-Edge-Terminal Collaborative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosive growth of video data has driven the development of distributed video analytics in cloud-edge-terminal collaborative (CETC) systems, enabling efficient video processing, real-time inference, and privacy-preserving analysis. Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability. Future directions also encompass explainable systems, efficient processing mechanisms, and advanced video analytics, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field.</description>

      <title>Instability of backoff protocols with arbitrary arrival rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17144v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contention resolution, multiple processors are trying to coordinate to send discrete messages through a shared channel with limited communication. If two processors send at the same time, the messages collide and are not transmitted successfully. Queue-free backoff protocols are an important special case - for example, Google Drive and AWS instruct their users to implement binary exponential backoff to handle busy periods. It is a long-standing conjecture of Aldous (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1987) that no stable backoff protocols exist for any positive arrival rate of processors. This foundational question remains open; instability is only known in general when the arrival rate of processors is at least 0.42 (Goldberg et al. SICOMP 2004). We prove Aldous' conjecture for all backoff protocols outside of a tightly-constrained special case using a new domination technique to get around the main difficulty, which is the strong dependencies between messages.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy AI-Generative Content for Intelligent Network Service: Robustness, Security, and Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) models, represented by large language models (LLM), have revolutionized content creation. High-speed next-generation communication technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC network services. At the same time, advanced AIGC techniques can also make future network services more intelligent, especially various online content generation services. However, the significant untrustworthiness concerns of current AIGC models, such as robustness, security, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of intelligent network services, especially in ensuring secure AIGC services. This paper proposes TrustGAIN, a trustworthy AIGC framework that incorporates robust, secure, and fair network services. We first discuss the robustness to adversarial attacks faced by AIGC models in network systems and the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of avoiding unsafe and illegal services and ensuring the fairness of the AIGC network services. Then as a case study, we propose a novel sentiment analysis-based detection method to guide the robust detection of unsafe content in network services. We conduct our experiments on fake news, malicious code, and unsafe review datasets to represent LLM application scenarios. Our results indicate that TrustGAIN is an exploration of future networks that can support trustworthy AIGC network services.</description>
