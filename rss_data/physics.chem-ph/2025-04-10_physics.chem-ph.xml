      <title>High efficiency quantification of $^{90}$Sr contamination in cow milk after a nuclear accident</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring $^{90}$Sr contamination in milk following a nuclear accident is critical due to its radiotoxicity and calcium-mimicking behaviour, leading to accumulation in bones and teeth. This study presents a high-efficiency protocol for quantifying$^{90}$Sr in cow milk by integrating freeze-drying, high-temperature calcination, ion exchange chromatography and liquid scintillation spectroscopy (LSC). The method was validated using reference milk samples with 0.45~Bq/mL of $^{90}$Sr, achieving a chemical yield of 100 $\pm$ 2\%, ensuring near-complete recovery and accurate quantification.
  The minimum detectable activity (MDA) was estimated at 0.33 Bq/L under optimal conditions, demonstrating the protocol's sensitivity for low-level detection. A comparative analysis with existing methods centrifugation-based approaches and Dowex resin techniques revealed that our protocol outperforms in both strontium recovery and organic matter elimination. Alternative methods showed lower recovery rates (68 $\pm$ 2\% for Gu\'erin's method, 65 $\pm$6\% for Dowex resin) and suffered from procedural drawbacks, such as incomplete organic matter removal.
  Applying this methodology to compare samples from certified laboratories confirmed its robustness, with liquid scintillation spectroscopy radioactivity values doubling after 14 days, consistent with secular equilibrium between $^{90}$Sr and $^{90}$Y. While the protocol is optimized for milk, future research should explore its applicability to other food matrices. The high yield, reliability, and ease of implementation position this method as an effective tool for nuclear emergency response and routine radiological monitoring.</description>

      <title>Correcting basis set incompleteness in wave function correlation energy by dressing electronic Hamiltonian with an effective short-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general approach to reducing basis set incompleteness error in electron correlation energy calculations. The correction is computed alongside the correlation energy in a single calculation by modifying the electron interaction operator with an effective short-range electron-electron interaction. Our approach is based on a local mapping between the Coulomb operator projected onto a finite basis and a long-range interaction represented by the error function with a local range-separated parameter, originally introduced by Giner et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 149, 194301 (2018)]. The complementary short-range interaction, included in the Hamiltonian, effectively accounts for the Coulomb interaction missing in a given basis. As a numerical demonstration, we apply the method with complete active space wavefunctions. Correlation energies are computed using two distinct approaches: the linearized adiabatic connection (AC0) method and n-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2). We obtain encouraging results for the dissociation energies of test molecules, with accuracy in a triple-$\zeta$ basis set comparable to or exceeding that of uncorrected AC0 or NEVPT2 energies in a quintuple-$\zeta$ basis set.</description>

      <title>Catalight -- an open source automated photocatalytic reactor package illustrated through plasmonic acetylene hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open-source and modular Python package, Catalight, is developed and demonstrated to automate (photo)catalysis measurements. (Photo)catalysis experiments require studying several parameters to evaluate performance, including temperature, gas flow rate and composition, illumination power, and spectral profile. Catalight orchestrates measurements over this complicated parameter space and systematically stores, analyzes, and visualizes the resulting data. To showcase the capabilities of Catalight, we perform an automated apparent activation barrier measurement of acetylene hydrogenation over a plasmonic AuPd catalyst on Al2O3 support, simultaneously varying laser power, wavelength, and temperature in a multi-day experiment controlled by a simple Python script. Our chemical results unexpectedly show an increased activation barrier upon light excitation, contrary to previous findings for other plasmonic reactions and catalysts. We show that the reaction rate order with respect to both acetylene and hydrogen is unchanged upon illumination, suggesting that molecular surface coverage is not changing under light excitation. By analyzing the inhomogeneity of the laser induced heating, we attribute these results to a partial photothermal effect combined with a photochemical/hot electron driven mechanism. Our findings highlight the capabilities of a new experiment automation tool; explore the photocatalytic mechanism for an industrially relevant reaction; and identify systematic sources of error in canon photocatalysis experimental procedures.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Accuracy Limit of Foundation Neural Network Models with Quantum Monte Carlo Forces and Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an end-to-end integrated strategy for the production of highly accurate quantum chemistry (QC) synthetic datasets aimed at deriving atomistic Foundation Machine Learning (ML) Models. We first present a GPU-accelerated QC database generation Exascale protocol able to produce the required energies and forces. A "Jacob's Ladder" approach leverages computationally-optimized layers of massively parallel high performance software with increasing accuracy to compute: i) Density Functional Theory (DFT); ii) Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC); iii) Selected Configuration Interaction (s-CI), within large volumes and optimized time-to-solution performances. Handling this ambitious computational pipeline would be impossible without exascale computing resources, particularly for the notoriously difficult and computationally intensive calculation of QMC forces and for the combination of multi-determinant QMC energies and forces using selected CI wavefunctions methodologies. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such quantities are computed at such scale. We combine these data with the FeNNix-Bio-1 foundation ML model to bridge the gap between highly accurate QC calculations and condensed-phase Molecular Dynamics (MD). We demonstrate stable multi-ns simulations using the resulting beyond DFT accuracy fully reactive model coupled to full path integrals adaptive sampling quantum dynamics. A complete 1 million-atom plant virus solvated structure, including its full genetic material, is simulated using Ring-Polymer MD quantum dynamics along as its response to acidification under physiological NaCl concentrations. These new capabilities open the door to the possibility to monitor bond breaking/creation and proton transfers chemical interactions taking place in biosystems allowing us to reach a deeper understanding of their complex internal machinery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we examine the electronic structure of quasi-one-dimensional fullerene nanoribbons derived from two-dimensional fullerene networks. Depending on the edge geometry and width, these nanoribbons exhibit a rich variety of properties, including direct and indirect band gaps, positive and negative effective masses, as well as dispersive and flat bands. Our findings establish a comprehensive understanding of the electronic properties of fullerene nanoribbons, with potential implications for the design of future nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Simple lipids form stable higher-order structures in concentrated sulfuric acid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Venus has become a target of astrobiological interest because it is physically accessible to direct exploration, unlike exoplanets. So far this interest has been motivated not by the explicit expectation of finding life but rather by a desire to understand the limits of biology. The venusian surface is sterilizing, but the cloud deck includes regions with temperatures and pressures conventionally considered compatible with life. However, the venusian clouds are thought to consist of concentrated sulfuric acid. To determine if any fundamental features of life as we understand them here on Earth could in principle exist in these extreme solvent conditions, we tested several simple lipids for resistance to solvolysis and their ability to form structures in concentrated sulfuric acid. We find that single-chain saturated lipids with sulfate, alcohol, trimethylamine, and phosphonate head groups are resistant to sulfuric acid degradation at room temperature. Furthermore, we find that they form stable higher-order structures typically associated with lipid membranes, micelles, and vesicles. Finally, results from molecular dynamics simulations suggest a molecular explanation for the observed robustness of the lipid structures formed in concentrated sulfuric acid. We conclude with implications for the study of Venus as a target of experimental astrobiology.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Molecular Benchmarks in Nonadiabatic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the coupled electronic and nuclear response of a molecule to light excitation requires the application of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. However, when faced with a specific photophysical or photochemical problem, selecting the most suitable theoretical approach from the wide array of available techniques is not a trivial task. The challenge is further complicated by the lack of systematic method comparisons and rigorous testing on realistic molecular systems. This absence of comprehensive molecular benchmarks remains a major obstacle to advances within the field of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. A CECAM workshop, Standardizing Nonadiabatic Dynamics: Towards Common Benchmarks, was held in May 2024 to address this issue. This Perspective highlights the key challenges identified during the workshop in defining molecular benchmarks for nonadiabatic dynamics. Specifically, this work outlines some preliminary observations on essential components needed for simulations and proposes a roadmap aiming to establish, as an ultimate goal, a community-driven, standardized molecular benchmark set.</description>

      <title>Advancing Electrochemical CO$_2$ Capture with Redox-Active Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing climate change calls for action to control CO$_2$ pollution. Direct air and ocean capture offer a solution to this challenge. Making carbon capture competitive with alternatives, such as forestation and mineralisation, requires fundamentally novel approaches and ideas. One such approach is electrosorption, which is currently limited by the availability of suitable electrosorbents. In this work, we introduce a metal-organic copper-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$) metal-organic framework (MOF) that can act as electrosorbent for CO$_2$ capture, thereby expanding the palette of materials that can be used for this process. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ is the first MOF to switch its ability to capture and release CO$_2$ in aqueous electrolytes. By using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), we demonstrate reversible CO$_2$ electrosorption. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide atomistic insights into the mechanism of electrosorption and conclude that efficient CO$_2$ capture is facilitated by a combination of redox-active copper atom and aromatic HHTP ligand within Cu3(HHTP)2. By showcasing the applicability of Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$ -- with a CO$_2$ capacity of 2 mmol g$^{-1}$ and an adsorption enthalpy of -20 kJ mol$^{-1}$ - this study encourages further exploration of conductive redox-active MOFs in the search for superior CO$_2$ electrosorbents.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>
