      <title>Multigraphs with Unique Partition into Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to Veblen's Theorem, if a connected multigraph $X$ has even degrees at each vertex, then it is Eulerian and its edge set has a partition into cycles. In this paper, we show that an Eulerian multigraph has a unique partition into cycles if and only if it belongs to the family $\mathcal{S}$, ``bridgeless cactus multigraphs", elements of which are obtained by replacing every edge of a tree with a cycle of length $\geq 2$. Other characterizing conditions for bridgeless cactus multigraphs and digraphs are provided.
  Furthermore, for a digraph $D$, we list conditions equivalent to having a unique Eulerian circuit, thereby generalizing a previous result of Arratia-Bollob\'{a}s-Sorkin. In particular, we show that digraphs with a unique Eulerian circuit constitute a subfamily of $\mathcal{S}$, namely, ``Christmas cactus digraphs".</description>

      <title>$\chi$-Boundedness and Neighbourhood Complexity of Bounded Merge-Width Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merge-width, recently introduced by Dreier and Toru\'nczyk, is a common generalisation of bounded expansion classes and twin-width for which the first-order model checking problem remains tractable. We prove that a number of basic properties shared by bounded expansion and bounded twin-width graphs also hold for bounded merge-width graphs: they are $\chi$-bounded, they satisfy the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property, and their neighbourhood complexity is linear.</description>

      <title>Degree sum conditions and a 2-factor with a bounded number of cycles in claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A claw-free graph is a graph that does not contain $K_{1,3}$ as an induced subgraph, and a 2-factor is a 2-regular spanning subgraph of a graph. In 1997, Ryj\'{a}\v{c}ek introduced the closure concept of claw-free graphs, and Hamilton cycles and related structures in claw-free graphs have been intensively studied via the closure concept. In this paper, using the closure concept, we show that for a claw-free graph $G$ of order $n$, if every independent set $I$ of $G$ satisfies $|I|\leq \delta_G(I)-1$ and $G$ satisfies $\sigma_{k+1}(G)\geq n$, then $G$ has a 2-factor with at most $k$ cycles, where $\delta_G(I)$ denotes the minimum degree of the vertices in $I$. As a corollary of the result, we show that every claw-free graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq \alpha(G)+1$ has a 2-factor with at most $\alpha(G)$ cycles, which partially solves a conjecture by Faudree et al. in 2012.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08327v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture that every graph of minimum degree five with no separating triangles and drawn in the plane with one crossing is 4-colorable. In this paper, we use computer enumeration to show that this conjecture holds for all graphs with at most 28 vertices, explore the consequences of this conjecture and provide some insights on how it could be proved.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Morphisms of Arithmetical Structures on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\phi \colon \Gamma_2 \rightarrow \Gamma_1$ be a harmonic morphism of connected graphs. We show that an arithmetical structure on $\Gamma_1$ can be pulled back via $\phi$ to an arithmetical structure on $\Gamma_2$. We then show that some results of Baker and Norine on the critical groups for the usual Laplacian extend to arithmetical critical groups, which are abelian groups determined by the generalized Laplacian associated to these arithmetical structures. In particular, we show that the morphism $\phi$ induces a surjective group homomorphism from the arithmetical critical group of $\Gamma_2$ to that of $\Gamma_1$ and an injective group homomorphism from the arithmetical critical group of $\Gamma_1$ to that of $\Gamma_2$. Finally, we prove a Riemann-Hurwitz formula for arithmetical structures.</description>

      <title>Graph shadows and edge-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of edge-regularity in graphs is a relaxation of the definition of strong regularity, so strongly regular graphs are edge-regular and, not surprisingly, the family of edge-regular graphs is much larger and more diverse than that of the strongly regular.
  In [1], a few methods of constructing new graphs from old are of use. One of these is the unary "graph shadow" operation. Here, this operation is generalized, and then generalized again, and conditions are given under which application of the new operations to edge-regular graphs result in edge-regular graphs. Also, some attention to strongly regular graphs is given.</description>

      <title>Counting independent sets in percolated graphs via the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, we form a random subgraph $G_p$ by including each edge of $G$ independently with probability $p$. We provide an asymptotic expansion of the expected number of independent sets in random subgraphs of regular bipartite graphs satisfying certain vertex-isoperimetric properties, extending the work of Kronenberg and Spinka on the percolated hypercube. Combining graph containers with the cluster expansion from statistical physics, we give an expansion of the partition function of the Ising model in certain range of the parameters. Among other applications, we obtain results for even tori of growing side-length. As a tool, we prove a refined container lemma for the Ising model, which mildly improves recent bounds of Jenssen, Malekshahian, and Park.</description>

      <title>Eigenspace embeddings of imprimitive association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given symmetric association scheme $\mathcal{A}$ and its eigenspace $S_j$ there exists a mapping of vertices of $\mathcal{A}$ to unit vectors of $S_j$, known as the spherical representation of $\mathcal{A}$ in $S_j$, such that the inner products of these vectors only depend on the relation between the corresponding vertices; furthermore, these inner products only depend on the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$. We consider parameters of imprimitive association schemes listed as open cases in the list of parameters for quotient-polynomial graphs recently published by Herman and Maleki, and study embeddings of their substructures into some eigenspaces consistent with spherical representations of the putative association schemes. Using this, we obtain nonexistence for two parameter sets of $3$-class association schemes and two parameter sets of $4$-class association schemes passing all previously known feasibility conditions.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to a conjecture by Salez and Youssef</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remarkable progress has been made in recent years to establish log-Sobolev type inequalities under the assumption of discrete Ricci curvature bounds. More specfically, Salez and Youssef have proven that the log-Sobolev constant can be lower bounded by the Bakry Emery curvature lower bound divided by the logarithm of the sparsity parameter. They conjectured that the same holds true when replacing Bakry Emery by Ollivier curvature which is often times easier to compute in practice. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is wrong by giving a counter example on birth death chains of increasing length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the exact asymptotic behavior of the connectivity probability in the Erdos-Renyi graph G(n,p), under different asymptotic assumptions on the edge probability p=p(n). We propose a novel approach based on the analysis of inhomogeneous random walks to derive this probability. We show that the problem of graph connectivity can be reduced to determining the probability that an inhomogeneous random walk with Poisson-distributed increments, conditioned to form a bridge, is actually an excursion</description>

      <title>The $k$-elongated plane partition function modulo small powers of $5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andrews and Paule revisited combinatorial structures known as the $k$-elongated partition diamonds, which were introduced in connection with the study of the broken $k$-diamond partitions. They found the generating function for the number $d_k(n)$ of partitions obtained by summing the links of such partition diamonds of length $n$ and discovered congruences for $d_k(n)$ using modular forms. Since then, congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors, most recently Banerjee and Smoot who established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of $5$. We extend in this paper the list of known results for $d_k(n)$ by proving infinite families of congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo $5,25$, and $125$ using classical $q$-series manipulations and $5$-dissections.</description>

      <title>Infinite unrestricted sumsets in subsets of abelian groups with large density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(G,+)$ be a countable abelian group such that the subgroup $\{g+g\colon g\in G\}$ has finite index and the doubling map $g\mapsto g+g$ has finite kernel. We establish lower bounds on the upper density of a set $A\subset G$ with respect to an appropriate F{\o}lner sequence, so that $A$ contains a sumset of the form $\{t+b_1+b_2\colon b_1,b_2\in B\}$ or $\{b_1+b_2\colon b_1,b_2\in B\}$, for some infinite $B\subset G$ and some $t\in G$. Both assumptions on $G$ are necessary for our results to be true. We also characterize the F{\o}lner sequences for which this is possible. Finally, we show that our lower bounds are optimal in a strong sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Frieze from 1985 asserts that the total weight of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ whose edges get independent weights from the distribution $UNIFORM[0,1]$ converges to Ap\'ery's constant in probability, as $n\to\infty$. We generalize this result to sequences of graphs $G_n$ that converge to a graphon $W$. Further, we allow the weights of the edges to be drawn from different distributions (subject to moderate conditions). The limiting total weight $\kappa(W)$ of the minimum spanning tree is expressed in terms of a certain branching process defined on $W$, which was studied previously by Bollob\'as, Janson and Riordan in connection with the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs.</description>

      <title>Modular Golomb rulers and almost difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(v,k,\lambda)$-difference set in a group $G$ of order $v$ is a subset $\{d_1, d_2, \ldots,d_k\}$ of $G$ such that $D=\sum d_i$ in the group ring ${\mathbb Z}[G]$ satisfies $$D D^{-1} = n + \lambda G,$$ where $n=k-\lambda$. In other words, the nonzero elements of $G$ all occur exactly $\lambda$ times as differences of elements in $D$.
  A $(v,k,\lambda,t)$-almost difference set has $t$ nonzero elements of $G$ occurring $\lambda$ times, and the other $v-1-t$ occurring $\lambda+1$ times. When $\lambda=0$, this is equivalent to a modular Golomb ruler. In this paper we investigate existence questions on these objects, and extend previous results constructing almost difference sets by adding or removing an element from a difference set. We also show for which primes the octic residues, with or without zero, form an almost difference set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bounds on the density of corner-free sets over quasirandom groups from inverse poly-logarithmic to quasi-polynomial. We make similarly substantial improvements to the best known lower bounds on the communication complexity of a large class of permutation functions in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. Underpinning both results is a general combinatorial theorem that extends the recent work of Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC'24), itself a development of ideas from the breakthrough result of Kelley and Meka on three-term arithmetic progressions (FOCS'23).</description>

      <title>WalkSAT is linear on random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an influential article Papadimitriou [FOCS 1991] proved that a local search algorithm called WalkSAT finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable 2-CNF with $n$ variables in $O(n^2)$ expected time. Variants of the WalkSAT algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (e.g., [Hoos and St\"utzle 2000]). In the present article we analyse the expected running time of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SICOMP 2007], we show that WalkSAT runs in linear expected time for all clause/variable densities up to the random 2-SAT satisfiability threshold.</description>

      <title>Finite analogs of partition bias related to hook length two and a variant of Sylvester's map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we count the total number of hooks of length two in all odd partitions of $n$ and all distinct partitions of $n$ with a bound on the largest part of the partitions. We generalize inequalities of Ballantine, Burson, Craig, Folsom and Wen by showing there is a bias in the number of hooks of length two in all odd partitions over all distinct partitions of $n$ in presence of a bound on the largest part. To establish such a bias, we use a variant of Sylvester's map. Then, we conjecture a similar finite bias for a weighted count of hooks of length two and prove it when we remove the bound on the largest part.</description>

      <title>Levelable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of positive weighted well-covered graphs, which we call levelable graphs, that are related to a construction of level artinian rings in commutative algebra. A graph $G$ is levelable if there exists a weight function with positive integer values on the vertices of $G$ such that $G$ is well-covered with respect to this weight function. That is, the sum of the weights in any maximal independent set of vertices of $G$ is the same. We describe some of the basic properties of levelable graphs and classify the levelable graphs for some families of graphs, e.g., trees, cubic circulants, Cameron--Walker graphs. We also explain the connection between levelable graphs and a class of level artinian rings. Applying a result of Brown and Nowakowski about weighted well-covered graphs, we show that for most graphs, their edge ideals are not Cohen--Macaulay.</description>

      <title>Clonoids of Boolean functions with a linear source clone and a semilattice or 0- or 1-separating target clone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending Sparks's theorem, we determine the cardinality of the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions for certain pairs $(C_1,C_2)$ of clones of Boolean functions. Namely, when $C_1$ is a subclone (a proper subclone, resp.) of the clone of all linear (affine) functions and $C_2$ is a subclone of the clone generated by a semilattice operation and constants (a subclone of the clone of all $0$- or $1$-separating functions, resp.), then the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids is uncountable. Combining this fact with several earlier results, we obtain a complete classification of the cardinalities of the lattices of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids for all pairs $(C_1,C_2)$ of clones on $\{0,1\}$.</description>

      <title>Distance signless Laplacian spectral radius and tough graphs involving minimun degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a simple graph, where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex set and the edge set of $G$, respectively. The number of components of $G$ is denoted by $c(G)$. Let $t$ be a positive real number, and a connected graph $G$ is $t$-tough if $t c(G-S)\leq|S|$ for every vertex cut $S$ of $V(G)$. The toughness of graph $G$, denoted by $\tau(G)$, is the largest value of $t$ for which $G$ is $t$-tough. Recently, Fan, Lin and Lu [European J. Combin. 110(2023), 103701] presented sufficient conditions based on the spectral radius for graphs to be 1-tough with minimum degree $\delta(G)$ and graphs to be $t$-tough with $t\geq 1$ being an integer, respectively. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions in terms of the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius for graphs to be 1-tough with minimum degree $\delta(G)$ and graphs to be $t$-tough, where $\frac{1}{t}$ is a positive integer. Moreover, we consider the relationship between the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius and $t$-tough graphs in terms of the order $n$.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fock-Goncharov coordinates for $\mathrm{SL}_3$-webs on surfaces II: naturality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a companion paper (arXiv 2011.01768), we constructed nonnegative integer coordinates $\Phi_\mathscr{T}(\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}}) \subset \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^N$ for the collection $\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}}$ of reduced $\mathrm{SL}_3$-webs on a finite-type punctured surface $\hat{S}$, depending on an ideal triangulation $\mathscr{T}$ of $\hat{S}$. We show that these coordinates are natural with respect to the choice of triangulation, in the sense that if a different triangulation $\mathscr{T}^\prime$ is chosen, then the coordinate change map relating $\Phi_\mathscr{T}(\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}})$ to $\Phi_{\mathscr{T}^\prime}(\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}})$ is a tropical $\mathcal{A}$-coordinate cluster transformation. We can therefore view the webs $\mathscr{W}_{3, \hat{S}}$ as a concrete topological model for the Fock-Goncharov-Shen positive integer tropical points $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{PGL}_3, \hat{S}}^+(\mathbb{Z}^t)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic independence for random permutations from surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an orientable hyperbolic surface of genus $g\geq 2$ with a marked point $o$, and let $\Gamma$ be an orientable hyperbolic surface group isomorphic to $\pi_{1}(X,o)$. Consider the space $\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$ which corresponds to $n$-sheeted covers of $X$ with labeled fiber. Given $\gamma\in\Gamma$ and a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$, what is the expected number of fixed points of $\phi(\gamma)$?
  Formally, let $F_{n}(\gamma)$ denote the number of fixed points of $\phi(\gamma)$ for a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We think of $F_{n}(\gamma)$ as a random variable on the space $\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We show that an arbitrary fixed number of products of the variables $F_{n}(\gamma)$ are asymptotically independent as $n\to\infty$ when there are no obvious obstructions. We also determine the limiting distribution of such products. Additionally, we examine short cycle statistics in random permutations of the form $\phi(\gamma)$ for a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We show a similar asymptotic independence result and determine the limiting distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by the exterior algebra of the tautological bundle. This formula provides a one-parametric deformation of the generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. In particular, we show that the capped vertex functions are rational functions of the quantum parameter.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Exploration of the Erd\"os-Moser Equation $ \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} i^k = m^k $ Using Approximation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation $ \sum_{i=1}^{m - 1} i^k = m^k $ is a longstanding challenge in number theory, with the only known integer solution being $ (k,m) = (1,3) $. Here, we investigate whether other solutions might exist by using the Euler-MacLaurin formula to approximate the discrete sum $ S(m-1,k) $ with a continuous function $ S_{\mathbb{R}}(m-1,k) $. We then analyze the resulting approximate polynomial $ P_{\mathbb{R}}(m) = S_{\mathbb{R}}(m-1,k) - m^k $ under the rational root theorem to look for integer roots. Our approximation confirms that for $ k=1 $, the only solution is $ m=3 $, and for $ k \geq 2 $ it suggests there are no further positive integer solutions. However, because Diophantine problems demand exactness, any omission of correction terms in the Euler-MacLaurin formula could mask genuine solutions. Thus, while our method offers valuable insights into the behavior of the Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation and illustrates the analytical challenges involved, it does not constitute a definitive proof. We discuss the implications of these findings and emphasize that fully rigorous approaches, potentially incorporating prime-power constraints, are needed to conclusively resolve the conjecture.</description>

      <title>On lower bounds of the density of planar periodic sets without unit distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the maximal density $m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ of planar sets without unit distances is a fundamental problem in combinatorial geometry. This paper investigates lower bounds for this quantity. We introduce a novel approach to estimating $m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ by reformulating the problem as a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem on graphs constructed from flat torus, focusing on periodic sets with respect to two non-collinear vectors. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical justifications of proposed method, demonstrate that for a sufficiently wide range of parameters this approach does not improve the known lower bound $0.22936 \le m_1(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The best discrete sets found are approximations of Croft's construction. In addition, several open source software packages for MIS problem are compared on this task.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Real algebraic surfaces biholomorphically equivalent but not algebraically equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer in the negative the long-standing open question of whether biholomorphic equivalence implies algebraic equivalence for germs of real algebraic manifolds in $\mathbb C^n$. More precisely we give an example of two germs of real algebraic surfaces in $\mathbb C^2$ that are biholomorphic, but not via an algebraic biholomorphism. In fact we even prove that the components of any biholomorphism between these two surfaces are never solutions of polynomial differential equations. The proof is based on enumerative combinatorics and differential Galois Theory results concerning the nature of the generating series of walks restricted to the quarter plane.</description>
