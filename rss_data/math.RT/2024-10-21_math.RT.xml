      <title>Stratifying Systems via Nested Family of Torsion Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of a nested family of torsion pairs and will prove that this concept is strongly related to the existence of stratifying systems. Specifically, every stratifying system induces a nested family of torsion pairs. Moreover, every stratifying system can be obtained as a quotient or submodule of a module that admits a certain direct sum decomposition with respect to the nested family of torsion pairs. Additionally, we present a stratifying system of infinite size that cannot be indexed by $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Locally isotropic Steinberg groups I. Centrality of the $\mathrm K_2$-functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin to study Steinberg groups associated with a locally isotropic reductive group $G$ over a arbitrary ring. We propose a construction of such a Steinberg group functor as a group object in a certain completion of the category of presheaves. We also show that it is a crossed module over $G$ in a unique way, in particular, that the $\mathrm K_2$-functor is central. If $G$ is globally isotropic in a suitable sense, then the Steinberg group functor exists as an ordinary group-valued functor and all such abstract Steinberg groups are crossed modules over the groups of points of $G$.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Auslander's formulas, I. Fundamental sequences associated with additive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any additive functor from modules (or, more generally, from an abelian category with enough projectives or injectives), we construct long sequences tying up together the derived functors, the satellites, and the stabilizations of the functor. For half-exact functors, the obtained sequences are exact. For general functors, nontrivial homology may only appear at the derived functors. Specializing to the familiar Hom and tensor product functors on finitely presented modules, we recover the classical formulas of Auslander. Unlike those formulas, our results hold for arbitrary rings and arbitrary modules, finite or infinite. The same formalism leads to universal coefficient theorems for homology and cohomology of arbitrary complexes. The new results are even more explicit for the cohomology of projective complexes and the homology of flat complexes.</description>

      <title>Categories of generalized quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the representation category of thread quivers and their quotients. A thread quiver is a quiver in which some arrows have been replaced by totally ordered sets. Pointwise finite-dimensional (pwf) representations of such a thread quiver admit a Krull-Remak-Schmidt-Azumaya decomposition. We show that an indecomposable representation is induced from an indecomposable representation of a quiver obtained from the original quiver by replacing some of its arrows by a finite linear $\mathbb{A}_n$ quiver. We study injective and projective pwf indecomposable representations and we fully classify them when the quiver satisfies a mild condition. We give a characterization of the indecomposable pwf representations of certain categories whose representation theory has similar properties to finite type or tame type. We further construct new hereditary abelian categories, including a Serre subcategory of pwf representations that includes every indecomposable representation.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis on standard locally homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X=G/H$ be a reductive homogeneous space with $H$ noncompact, endowed with a $G$-invariant pseudo-Riemannian structure. Let $L$ be a reductive subgroup of $G$ acting properly on $X$ and $\Gamma$ a torsion-free discrete subgroup of $L$. Under the assumption that the complexification $X_{\mathbb C}$ is $L_{\mathbb C}$-spherical, we prove an explicit correspondence between spectral analysis on the standard locally homogeneous space $X_{\Gamma}=\Gamma\backslash X$ and on $\Gamma\backslash L$ via branching laws for the restriction to $L$ of irreducible representations of $G$. In particular, we prove that the pseudo-Riemannian Laplacian on $X_{\Gamma}$ is essentially self-adjoint, and that it admits an infinite point spectrum when $X_{\Gamma}$ is compact or $\Gamma\subset L$ is arithmetic. The proof builds on structural results for invariant differential operators on spherical homogeneous spaces with overgroups.</description>

      <title>Stratifying systems and Jordan-H\"{o}lder extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stratifying systems, which have been defined for module, triangulated and exact categories previously, were developed to produce examples of standardly stratified algebras. A stratifying system $\Phi$ is a finite set of objects satisfying some orthogonality conditions. One very interesting property is that the subcategory $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ of objects admitting a composition series-like filtration with factors in $\Phi$ has the Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder property on these filtrations.
  This article has two main aims. First, we introduce notions of subobjects, simple objects and composition series for an extriangulated category, in order to define a Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder extriangulated category. Moreover, we characterise Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder, length, weakly idempotent complete extriangulated categories in terms of the associated Grothendieck monoid and Grothendieck group. Second, we develop a theory of stratifying systems in extriangulated categories. We define projective stratifying systems and show that every stratifying system $\Phi$ in an extriangulated category is part of a minimal projective one $(\Phi,Q)$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}(\Phi)$ is a length, Jordan-H{\"{o}}lder extriangulated category when $(\Phi,Q)$ satisfies a left exactness condition.
  We give several examples and answer a recent question of Enomoto--Saito in the negative.</description>

      <title>Shimura operators for certain Hermitian symmetric superpairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09249v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a partial super analog of a result obtained by S. Sahi and G. Zhang relating Shimura operators and certain interpolation symmetric polynomials. In particular, we study the pair $(\mathfrak{gl}(2p|2q), \mathfrak{gl}(p|q)\oplus\mathfrak{gl}(p|q))$, define the super Shimura operators in $\mathfrak{U}(\mathfrak{g})^\mathfrak{k}$, and using a new method, prove that their images under the Harish-Chandra homomorphism are proportional to Sergeev and Veselov's Type $BC$ interpolation supersymmetric polynomials, under the assumption that a family of irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$-modules are spherical. We prove this conjecture using the notion of quasi-sphericity for Kac modules when $p=q=1$, and give explicit coordinates of (quasi-)spherical vectors.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for $\left(\mathrm{U}\left(2n\right),\mathrm{U}\left(1\right)\right)$ in general and prove its refinement, namely the Ichino-Ikeda type explicit formula for the central $L$-values, under certain assumptions. Similarly, we also prove its split analogue, namely the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture and its refinement for $\left(\mathrm{GL}_{2n}, \mathrm{GL}_1\right) $ in general.</description>

      <title>Yangian for cotangent Lie algebras and spectral $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a canonical quantization of Lie bialgebra structures on the formal power series $\mathfrak{d}[\![t]\!]$ with coefficients in the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d} = T^*\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g} \ltimes \mathfrak{g}^*$ to a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that these quantizations produce twists to the natural analog of the Yangian for $\mathfrak{d}$. Moreover, we construct spectral $R$-matrices for these twisted Yangians as compositions of twisting matrices.
  The motivation for the construction of these twisted Yangians over $\mathfrak{d}$ comes from certain 4d holomorphic-topological gauge theory. More precisely, we show that pertubative line operators in this theory can be realized as representations of these Yangians. Moreover, the comultiplications of these Yangians correspond to the monodial structure of the category of line operators.</description>
