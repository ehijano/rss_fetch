      <title>Price predictability in limit order book with deep learning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the prediction of high-frequency price changes using deep learning models. Although state-of-the-art methods perform well, their complexity impedes the understanding of successful predictions. We found that an inadequately defined target price process may render predictions meaningless by incorporating past information. The commonly used three-class problem in asset price prediction can generally be divided into volatility and directional prediction. When relying solely on the price process, directional prediction performance is not substantial. However, volume imbalance improves directional prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Consistent Estimation of the High-Dimensional Efficient Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the main characteristics of the mean-variance efficient frontier employing random matrix theory. Our particular interest covers the case when the dimension $p$ and the sample size $n$ tend to infinity simultaneously and their ratio $p/n$ tends to a positive constant $c\in(0,1)$. We neither impose any distributional nor structural assumptions on the asset returns. For the developed theoretical framework, some regularity conditions, like the existence of the $4$th moments, are needed.
  It is shown that two out of three quantities of interest are biased and overestimated by their sample counterparts under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. This becomes evident based on the asymptotic deterministic equivalents of the sample plug-in estimators. Using them we construct consistent estimators of the three characteristics of the efficient frontier. It it shown that the additive and/or the multiplicative biases of the sample estimates are solely functions of the concentration ratio $c$. Furthermore, the asymptotic normality of the considered estimators of the parameters of the efficient frontier is proved. Verifying the theoretical results based on an extensive simulation study we show that the proposed estimator for the efficient frontier is a valuable alternative to the sample estimator for high dimensional data. Finally, we present an empirical application, where we estimate the efficient frontier based on the stocks included in S\&amp;P 500 index.</description>

      <title>Application of Hawkes volatility in the observation of filtered high-frequency price process in tick structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hawkes model is suitable for describing self and mutually exciting random events.
  In addition, the exponential decay in the Hawkes process allows us to calculate the moment properties in the model.
  However, due to the complexity of the model and formula, few studies have been conducted on the performance of Hawkes volatility.
  In this study, we derived a variance formula that is directly applicable under the general settings of both unmarked and marked Hawkes models for tick-level price dynamics.
  In the marked model, the linear impact function and possible dependency between the marks and underlying processes are considered.
  The Hawkes volatility is applied to the mid-price process filtered at 0.1-second intervals to show reliable results;
  furthermore, intraday estimation is expected to have high utilization in real-time risk management. 
  We also note the increasing predictive power of intraday Hawkes volatility over time and examine the relationship between futures and stock volatilities.</description>
