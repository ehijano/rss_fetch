      <title>Exploring the gluon Sivers function in photon + jet production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transverse single spin asymmetries (TSSAs) in back-to-back photon plus jet production in the scattering of unpolarized beams of protons off a transversely polarized proton target as probes of Gluon Sivers Function (GSF). We provide estimates within the region where the imbalance $\vec{q}_{\perp} \equiv \vec{p}_{\gamma\perp} + \vec{p}_{J\perp}$ between the transverse momenta of the photon and the jet is much smaller than the average of the transverse momenta $\vec{p}_{\perp} \equiv \lvert \vec{p}_{\gamma\perp} - \vec{p}_{J\perp} \rvert / 2$ i.e. the back-to-back region. The presence of these two scales in the process makes it particularly suitable for applying transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization, in contrast to single-scale processes that rely on the generalized parton model approach. We present our preliminary results of the transverse single spin asymmetry for this process at $\sqrt{s} $ = 200 GeV.</description>

      <title>Could We Observe an Exploding Black Hole in the Near Future?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observation of an exploding black hole would provide the first direct evidence of primordial black holes, the first direct evidence of Hawking radiation, and definitive information on the particles present in nature. However, indirect constraints suggest that direct observation of an exploding Schwarzschild black hole is implausible. We introduce a dark-QED toy model consisting of a dark photon and a heavy dark electron. In this scenario a population of light primordial black holes charged under the dark $u(1)$ symmetry can become quasi-extremal, so they survive much longer than if they were uncharged, before discharging and exhibiting a Schwarzschild-like final explosion. We show that the answer is "yes", in this scenario the probability of observing an exploding black hole over the next $10$ years could potentially be over $90\%$.</description>

      <title>Pre-thermalized Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational wave (GW) production mechanism from gravitons generated during the pre-thermal phase of cosmic reheating, where the energy density is dominated by non-thermalized inflaton decay products, dubbed reheatons. We consider multiple production channels, including: $i)$ pure inflaton-inflaton annihilation, $ii)$ graviton Bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $iii)$ scatterings between an inflaton and a reheaton, and $iv)$ scatterings among reheatons. To determine the resulting GW spectrum, we solve the Boltzmann equation to obtain the graviton phase-space distribution for each channel. We find that the third channel, $iii)$, dominates due to the large occupation number of reheatons at highly-energetic states during the pre-thermalization phase. Notably, in scenarios with a low inflaton mass, the GW spectrum could fall within the sensitivity range of future experiments such as the Einstein Telescope, the Cosmic Explorer, the Big Bang Observer, and ultimate DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading power jet functions in the small-mass limit in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the factorization properties of the massive fermion form factor in QED, to next-to-leading power in the fermion mass, and up to two-loop order. For this purpose we define new jet functions that have multiple connections to the hard part as operator matrix elements, and compute them to second order in the coupling. We test our factorization formula using these new jet functions in a region-based analysis and find that factorization indeed holds. We address a number of subtle aspects such as rapidity regulators and external line corrections, and we find an interesting sequence of relations among the jet functions.</description>

      <title>On Gauge Theories of Neutrino Masses and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the predictions in the simplest theory for neutrino masses based on the spontaneous breaking of local lepton number. This theory provides a simple theoretical framework to understand the possible relation between the origin of neutrino masses and the nature of the dark matter. In this theory, one of the fields needed for anomaly cancellation is a dark matter candidate and the local lepton number is broken at the low scale. We discuss in great detail the dark matter properties showing the allowed parameter space by the relic density bounds and the predictions for direct detection. The predictions for gamma and neutrino lines from dark matter annihilation are investigated. In the case of Dirac neutrinos, the bound on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom plays an important role and the predictions for gamma lines could be tested in the near future. We discuss the predictions in the case of Majorana neutrinos where the dark matter candidate has extra annihilation channels and compare all the predictions to the case with Dirac neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of $\chi_{c}\gamma$ pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we study the exclusive photoproduction of $\chi_{c}\gamma$ pairs in the collinear factorization framework. We found the coefficient functions for all possible spins and helicity projections of $\chi_{c}$ mesons and final-state photons in the leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$. In our analysis we focused on the contribution of the leading twist chiral even GPDs, and found that for all spin states of $\chi_{c}$ the suggested process is determined by the behavior of the gluon GPDs $H_{g}$ in the ERBL kinematics. Using the phenomenological parametrizations of the GPDs from the literature, we estimated numerically the photoproduction cross-sections and the expected counting rates in the kinematics of middle-energy photoproduction experiments that could be realized at the Electron-Ion Collider. We observed that the $\chi_{c1}$, $\chi_{c2}$ mesons are produced predominantly with the same polarization as the incoming photon, and the expected counting rates of $\chi_{c1}\gamma$ and $\chi_{c2}\gamma$ pairs are sufficiently large for their experimental study. We also analyzed the angular distribution of $\chi_{c}$ mesons in electroproduction experiments, and noticed that for some helicity components there are sizable angular asymmetries, which can be used as complementary observables for experimental study. Finally, we estimated the role of this process as a potential background to $\chi_{c}$ photoproduction, which has been recently suggested as a tool for studies of odderons. We found that the contribution of $\chi_{c}\gamma$ (with undetected photon) is on par with expected contributions of odderons and Primakoff mechanisms in the kinematics of small momentum transfer $|t|\lesssim1$ GeV$^{2}$, but becomes negligible at larger $|t|$.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photon-fusion production of even-spin resonances and exotic QED atoms in high-energy hadron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross sections for the single exclusive production of (pseudo)scalar and (pseudo)tensor hadrons, as well as of even-spin QED bound states formed by pairs of opposite-charge leptons or hadrons, are estimated for photon-fusion processes in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus at the RHIC, LHC and FCC colliders, as well as in proton-air interactions at the highest energies reached by cosmic-rays impinging on earth. The UPC cross sections are computed in the equivalent photon approximation with realistic photon fluxes from the charged form factors of proton, lead, gold, and nitrogen ions. The production of four types of even-spin systems are considered: quarkonium (spin-0,2,4 meson bound states, from the lightest $\pi^0$ meson up to toponium), exotic hadrons (including candidate multiquark states), leptonium (positronium, dimuonium, and ditauonium), as well as mesonium (pionium, kaonium, D-onia, and B-onia) and baryonium (notably, protonium) QED atoms. The expected yields at the different colliders are presented for about 50 such even-spin composite resonances, for which the ALICE and LHCb experiments have potential reconstruction capabilities at the LHC. The impact of the diphoton decays of such even-spin states is also discussed as resonant backgrounds in the measurement of light-by-light scattering ($\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$) over $m_{\gamma\gamma} = 0.1$--15 GeV in PbPb UPCs at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Attractive features of Higgsino Dark Matter in the GNMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10985v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Higgsino dark matter(DM) scenario of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM), the mixing of Gaugino and Higgsino influences the mass splitting between neutralinos predominantly composed of Higgsino and introduces coupling between the DM and Higgs bosons. These effects modify the DM-nucleon scattering cross-section, causing conflicts with the latest direct detection experiment results from LZ for both substantial and minute mixings. Consequently, the experimental measurement of DM relic density necessitates the Higgsino DM mass to be approximately 1.1 TeV. We discovered that in the Higgsino DM scenario of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model(NMSSM), the mixing of Singlino and Higgsino introduces analogous effects, with a crucial distinction being that the current LZ experiment permits significant mixing between Singlino and Higgsino. This pronounced mixing effect effectively attenuates the interactions between Higgsino-dominated neutralinos and standard model particles, enabling DM masses exceeding roughly 700 GeV to achieve the correct relic abundance. Through analytical formulas and numerical results, we elucidated these characteristics. Our research reveals that in the NMSSM, when comprehensively examining the mixing effects of Higgsino, Gaugino, and Singlino, the properties of Higgsino DM become markedly more intricate compared to the MSSM predictions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of bound and resonant states of doubly heavy tetraquarks with spin $J\leq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a number of exotic hadrons have been reported in the experiments, and most of these states lie slightly below the threshold. Therefore, these states are considered to be hadronic molecules composed of mesons or baryons. In 2022, the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ was reported by the LHCb experiment, which is considered to be composed of two heavy quarks and two light antiquarks, and located slightly below the $DD^\ast$ threshold. The observation motivates us to study the bound and resonant states of the doubly heavy tetraquarks as two meson systems. We employ the one boson exchange potential as an interaction between two mesons, where one free parameter has been determined to reproduce $T_{cc}$ reported by the LHCb experiment. In our previous work, bound states of $D^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$ and $B^{(\ast)}B^{(\ast)}$ molecules were studied, where we respected the heavy quark spin symmetry (HQS). Using the same framework, we study not only bound but also resonant states with $J\leq 2$ in this paper. Furthermore, we discuss the HQS partner structures of $T_{cc}$ and $T_{bb}$ obtained in our study by introducing the light cloud basis.</description>

      <title>Origin of CKM matrix and natural FCNC suppression in gauge-Higgs unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped space the mixing in the $W$ couplings in the quark sector is induced by masses of $SO(5)$ singlet fermions which are responsible for splitting masses of down-type quarks from those of up-type quarks in each generation. We show that the observed Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in the $W$ couplings is reproduced within experimental errors. Further flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the quark sector are shown to be naturally suppressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss relativistic and radiative corrections to the energies of quantum cyclotron states. In particular, it is shown analytically that the leading logarithmic radiative (self-energy) correction to the bound-state energy levels of quantum cyclotron states is state-independent, and must be interpreted as a magnetic-field-dependent correction to the electron's mass in a Penning trap.</description>

      <title>Determination of unpolarized TMD distributions from the fit of Drell-Yan and SIDIS data at N$^4$LL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fit of the transverse momentum spectrum for Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering data, based on transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization at N$^4$LL accuracy. Our analysis shows good agreement with the data and confirms the findings of previous studies. Based on this, we extract the unpolarized TMD parton distribution functions, the TMD fragmentation functions, and the Collins-Soper kernel. Compared to earlier works, our study incorporates several improvements, including large-$x$ resummation, flavor and fragmentation function dependence, among others. Additionally, we supplement our extraction with an analysis of the transverse momentum moments of the extracted distributions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $B_{c}^-\to J/\psi (\eta_c) L^-$ decays within the SM and beyond in QCD factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the deviations observed between the experimental measurements and the SM predictions of the branching ratios $\mathcal{B}(\bar{B}_s^0\to D_s^+ \pi^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(\bar{B}_d^0\to D^+ K^-)$, we revisit the $B_{c}^{-}\to J/\psi(\eta_{c}) L^{-}$ decays, with $L=\pi, K^{(*)}, \rho$, both within the SM and beyond. Firstly, we update the SM predictions by including the nonfactorizable vertex corrections up to NNLO in $\alpha_s$, within the QCD factorization approach. It is found that, compared to the LO results, the branching ratios of these decays are always enhanced by the NLO and NNLO corrections, with an amount of about $6\%$ and $9\%$, respectively. To minimize the uncertainties brought by $V_{cb}$ and the $B_{c}\to J/\psi(\eta_c)$ form factors, we construct the ratios of the nonleptonic decay rates with respect to the corresponding differential semileptonic decay rates evaluated at $q^2=m_L^2$ (for $R_{J/\psi(\eta_{c}) L}$ and $R_{(s)L}^{(\ast)}$) or integrated over the whole $q^2$ range (for $R_{\pi/\mu\nu_{\mu}}$), which are then used to constrain the NP coefficients. After considering the latest Belle data on $\mathcal{B}(\bar{B}^0\to D^{(*)+} \pi(K)^{-})$ and the updated fitting results of $B_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ form factors, we find that the deviations can still be explained by the NP four-quark operators with $(1+\gamma_{5}) \otimes (1\pm\gamma_{5})$ structures, while the solution with $\gamma^\mu (1+\gamma_{5}) \otimes \gamma_\mu (1-\gamma_{5})$ structure does not work anymore, under the combined constraints from $R_{(s)L}^{(\ast)}$ at the $2\sigma$ level. Furthermore, the ratio $R_{\pi/\mu\nu_{\mu}}$, once measured precisely, can provide complementary constraint on these NP coefficients. With the large $B_c$ events expected at the LHC, more precise measurements of these observables can be exploited to discriminate these different NP scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors in the perturbative limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) have been paid attention in recent years because of their relation with the energy momentum tensor (EMT) form factors (FFs). The GDAs can be experimentally accessed through the study of amplitudes in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, where $M_1M_2$ is a pseudoscalar meson pair such as $\pi \eta $ and $\eta \eta^{\prime}$. In this paper we calculate these amplitudes in the perturbative limit where the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are expressed in terms of meson distribution amplitudes which have been constrained in the past experiments. Our explicit calculation verifies the existence of a new EMT FF which breaks the conservation law of EMT for each quark flavor in its hadronic matrix element. In addition, our result shows that the $M_1M_2$ GDAs are identical between $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$, which confirms the universality of GDAs. In future, the GDAs and EMT FFs studied in this paper can be investigated at Belle II. Our study enhances the accessibility to the $P$-wave GDAs in $\gamma^{\ast} \gamma \to M_1 M_2$ and $\gamma^{\ast} \to M_1 M_2 \gamma$ and gives a promising way to search for exotic hybrid mesons in the future experiment.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that alternative theories to the Standard Model allow -- and sometimes require -- fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, to vary in spacetime. We demonstrate that one way to investigate these variations is through the Mass-Radius relation of compact astrophysical objects, which is inherently affected by $\alpha$ variations. We start by considering the model of a polytropic white dwarf, which we perturb by adding the $\alpha$ variations for a generic class of Grand Unified Theories. We then extend our analysis to neutron stars, building upon the polytropic approach to consider more realistic equations of state, discussing the impact of such variations on mass-radius measurements in neutron stars. We present some constraints on these models based on current data and also outline how future observations might distinguish between extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Identified hadron production at hadron colliders in NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to identified hadron production at hadron colliders. The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present updated constraints on the top-quark sector of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory using data available from Tevatron, LEP and the LHC. Bounds are obtained for the Wilson coefficients from a global fit including the relevant two-fermion operators, four-quark operators and two-quark two-lepton operators. We compare the current bounds with the prospects for the high luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider and future lepton colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the Higgs particle self-coupling and its implications for electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model. We review the current experimental constraints on the Higgs trilinear coupling and discuss the challenges in measuring it precisely. The potential consequences of deviations from the Standard Model prediction are explored, including the possibility of new physics. We then consider an alternative ultraviolet complete electroweak theory based on finite quantum field theory, which does not require spontaneous symmetry breaking or a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The predictions of this model for particle masses and the stability of the electroweak vacuum are compared to the standard Higgs mechanism. Finally, we review the SM derivation of the W-boson mass, its dependence on radiative corrections and its experimentally determined value.</description>

      <title>Penguin decays of B mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a set of optimized observables using penguin mediated $\bar{B}_d$ and $\bar{B}_s$ decays to $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $K^*\phi$ final states that exhibhit a reduced sensitivity to power corrections than the corresponding branching ratios. Using these observables, branching ratios for the related vector-vector and pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar modes and branching ratios for modes involving other relevant pseudoscalar-vector final states ($K\phi$, $K^*\bar{K})$, we attempt to resolve the emergent combined pattern by assuming new physics contributions to the weak effective operators at the scale of the mass of the $b$ quark that are already present in the Standard Model. We find that the simplest scenario that can offer a simultaneous explanation is the two-operator scenario $Q_{4s,d}-Q_{6s,d}$. We briefly discuss how future experimental measurements may alter this picture and try to motivate such measurements for specific modes from our analysis.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning Strategies for Jet Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the re-simulation-based self-supervised learning approach to learning representations of hadronic jets in colliders by exploiting the Markov property of the standard simulation chain. Instead of masking, cropping, or other forms of data augmentation, this approach simulates pairs of events where the initial portion of the simulation is shared, but the subsequent stages of the simulation evolve independently. When paired with a contrastive loss function, this naturally leads to representations that capture the physics in the initial stages of the simulation. In particular, we force the hard scattering and parton shower to be shared and let the hadronization and interaction with the detector evolve independently. We then evaluate the utility of these representations on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $&gt;70\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on generalised axion-like potentials for the late Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on SIGW with Future Pulsar Timing Array Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

      <title>Triple-charmed Hadron from Coalescence in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Unlike proton-proton collisions, nuclear collisions produce both deconfined matter and abundant charm quark pairs, which can coalesce to form the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon, thereby significantly enhancing its production. We employ the Langevin model and the Instantaneous Coalescence Model (LICM), coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, to study charm quark diffusion and coalescence into the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon in expanding QCD matter. The thermal production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ is governed by the charm quark densities and the in-medium wavefunctions of the $\Omega_{ccc}$, which determines the coalescence probability for the three charm quarks. We calculate the $\Omega_{ccc}$ production with realistic charm diffusions and different in-medium wave functions of $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon. We find that the production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon is sensitive to these factors, which aids in understanding its properties in the hot QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Strings beyond Kination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel mechanism for the production of a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed in the context of a kinating background driven by the volume modulus of string compactifications. In this paper, we generalise the analysis of this growth mechanism by using dynamical system techniques. We first study the cosmological growth of strings in a spatially-flat Universe filled with a perfect fluid and a field-dependent tension, finding the fixed points of the phase space of this system. We then apply this analysis to fundamental strings and EFT strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$-cycles. We find a cosmological growth for fundamental strings even without kination, as in scaling fixed points, and for EFT strings arising from D3- and NS5-branes wrapped around fibration cycles.</description>

      <title>Scaling and universality in strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive scaling laws that connect certain macroscopic observables of strange quark stars with key microscopic properties of self-bound quark matter, such as the energy per baryon at zero pressure and the strength of repulsive interactions. We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Properties of Ultralight Bosons from Spins of Heavy Quasars via Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12790v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of $D_{s0}^{*}$(2317) in quark models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3} Collaboration updated the data for the exotic state, $D^{*}_{s0}(2317)$, with a mass of $2318.3\pm1.2\pm1.2$ MeV from the positronium annihilation process. Inspired by the experiment, we systematically investigated the $c\bar{q}$ meson family spectrum from the perspectives of two-quark, four-quark, and mixed two-four-quark structures, including $D_s$, $D_s^{*}$, $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$, and $D_{s1}(2460)$, with the help of the Gaussian expansion method, which is a very accurate calculation method for few-body systems. We found that with appropriate spin-orbit coupling parameter $a_s$, the chiral quark model can effectively describe both $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$. The four-quark calculation shows that the $DK$ state does not form a bound state, but the effective potential calculation shows an attractive interaction between them. Finally, we performed mixed two-four-quark calculations, and the results, with the help of the unquenched effect, show that the energies of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are in better agreement with experimental values. Therefore, we conclude that these two particles are good candidates for mixed two-four-quark states.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Search with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new ideas to directly search for light dark matter, such as the axion or the dark photon, by using magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds. If the dark matter couples to the electron spin, it affects the evolution of the Bloch vectors consisting of the spin triplet states, which may be detected through several magnetometry techniques. We give several concrete examples with the use of dc and ac magnetometry and estimate the sensitivity on dark matter couplings.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations of charm and anticharm quarks at hadronisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collisions are a unique tool for studying physics at high energy densities. In particular, the momentum correlations of charm and bottom hadrons have been considered for testing heavy quark thermalization in dense medium produced by the collisions. In this respect, two effects have been considered: the decrease of the initial back-to-back correlations and the increase of correlations due to heavy-quark interactions with collectively flowing medium.
  Here, we show that information on the spatial correlations of the charm-anticharm quarks at the hadronisation can be extracted by measuring the momentum correlation of charm and anticharm hadrons produced in collisions of two heavy nuclei. We introduce a method to correct the measured joint distribution function for smearing the charm and anticharm hadron momenta caused by hadronisation. This increases the sensitivity of the results to the spatial correlations at the hadronisation. Using an example of central Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS energies, we demonstrate that the azimuthal correlations of charm and anticharm hadrons are particularly sensitive to their spatial correlations.
  The results on spatial charm-anticharm quark correlations can be used for testing models of heavy quark creation in space-time and transport in dense, strongly interacting matter. We show that the existing detector technology and beam intensities at the CERN SPS should allow us to conduct the needed experiments soon.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative quantum Yang--Mills at finite temperature beyond lattice: a Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a Dyson--Schwinger approach, we perform an analysis of the non-trivial ground state of thermal $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in the non-perturbative regime where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Basic thermodynamic observables such as energy density and pressure are derived analytically, using Jacobi Elliptic functions. The results are compared with lattice results. Good agreement is found at low temperatures, providing a viable scenario of a gas of massive glue states populating higher levels of the spectrum of the theory. At high temperatures a scenario without glue states consistent with a massive scalar field is observed, showing an interesting agreement with lattice data. The possibility is discussed that the results derived in this analysis open up a novel pathway beyond lattice to precision studies of phase transitions with false vacuum and cosmological relics that depend on QCD-like equations of state in strongly coupled gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Center-of-mass energy dependence of intrinsic-$k_T$ distributions obtained from Drell-Yan production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal motion of partons inside hadrons has been studied through its impact on very low transverse momentum spectra of Drell-Yan (DY) pairs created in hadron-hadron collisions. We study DY production at next-to-leading order using the Parton Branching (PB) method which describes the evolution of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. The main focus is on studying the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution (intrinsic-$k_T$) as a function of the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s$. While collinear parton shower Monte Carlo event generators require intrinsic transverse momentum distributions strongly dependent on $\sqrt s$, this is not the case for the PB method. We perform a detailed study of the impact of soft parton emissions. We show that by requiring a minimal transverse momentum, $q_0$, of a radiated parton, a dependence of the width of the intrinsic-$k_T$ distribution as a function of $\sqrt{s}$ is observed. This dependence becomes stronger with increasing $q_0$.</description>

      <title>Neutral-current background induced by atmospheric neutrinos at large liquid-scintillator detectors: III. Comprehensive prediction for low energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos play a vital role in generating irreducible backgrounds in liquid-scintillator (LS) detectors via their neutral-current (NC) interactions with $^{12}$C nuclei. These interactions may affect a wide range of research areas from the MeV to GeV energy range, such as the reactor and geo neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), dark matter, and nucleon decay searches. In this work, we extend our preceding paper, by conducting a first-time systematic exploration of NC backgrounds as low as the MeV region of reactor and geo neutrinos. We utilize up-to-date neutrino generator models from GENIE and NuWro, a TALYS-based nuclear deexcitation package and a GEANT4-based detector simulation toolkit for our complete calculation. Our primary focus is to predict the NC background for experimental searches of inverse-beta-decay signals below the 100 MeV visible energy. In order to have deeper understanding of the characteristics of atmospheric neutrino NC interactions in LS, we investigate the model dependence of NC background predictions by using various data-driven models, including the initial neutrino-nucleon interactions, nuclear ground-state structure, final-state interactions, nuclear deexcitation processes, and secondary interactions of final-state particles.</description>

      <title>Detectability of the Phase Transition Gravitational Waves in the DFSZ axion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, an increasing number of studies have focused on using gravitational waves to explore axions and the dynamics of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking at high energy scales in the early universe. To accurately quantify the capability of specific gravitational wave experiments to probe the axion properties, it is crucial to perform precise calculations of gravitational wave signals based on given axion models and to conduct detailed detectability analysis tailored to the experimental configurations. Therefore, in this work, we consider the widely-studied DFSZ axion model and, for the first time, perform precise calculations of the phase transition dynamics parameters and associated gravitational wave signals. Our results demonstrate that the DFSZ model allows a strong first-order phase transition for the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking process at high energy scales exceeding $10^{9}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Moreover, by calculating the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational waves and comparing it with the thresholds of the Cosmic Explorer detector, we find that these signals are observable by the Cosmic Explorer with the energy scale range from $10^9~\mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{12}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Notably, through Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that if Cosmic Explorer detectors observe these gravitational waves, the bubble wall velocity will be the first parameter to be determined. This study demonstrates that gravitational wave detection offers a powerful approach to investigating axion dynamics complementary to other experiments.</description>

      <title>Novel azimuthal observables from two-photon collision at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we advocate a set of novel azimuthal-angle-related observables associated with exclusive hadron production from two-photon fusion at $e^+ e^-$ colliders, taking the $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ as a benchmark process. As a direct consequence of the linearly polarized quasi-real photons emitted off the electron and positron beams, the $\cos 2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in dipion production is predicted within the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization framework. In numerical analysis, we take the helicity amplitudes of $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ determined from the partial wave solutions in dispersion relation as input, and find that the predicted $\cos2\phi$ azimuthal modulation may reach 40\% for the typical kinematical setup of {\tt Belle 2} and {\tt BESIII} experiments. Future accurate measurement of this azimuthal asymmetry may facilitate the direct extraction of the relative phase between two helicity amplitudes with photon helicity configurations $++$ and $+-$. This knowledge provides a valuable input for the dispersive determination of the hadronic light-by-light (Hlbl) contributions.</description>

      <title>CP asymmetries of $t \to c \gamma$ and $t \to cg$ decays in the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the CP asymmetries of the rare top-quark decays $t \to c \gamma$ and $t \to cg$ in the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (A2HDM), which is generically characterized by new sources of CP violation beyond the Standard Model (SM). Specifically, the branching ratios and CP asymmetries of these rare top-quark decays are explicitly formulated, with an emphasis on the origins of weak and strong phases in the A2HDM. Taking into account the most relevant constraints on this model, we evaluate the variations of these observables with respect to the model parameters. It is found that the branching ratios of $t \to c \gamma$ and $t \to cg$ decays can maximally reach up to $1.47\times10^{-10}$ and $4.86\times10^{-9}$ respectively, which are about four and three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding SM predictions. While the branching ratios are almost independent of the relative phase $\varphi$ between the two alignment parameters $\varsigma_u$ and $\varsigma_d$ within the allowed parameter space, the CP asymmetries are found to be very sensitive to $\varphi$. When the two alignment parameters are complex with a non-zero $\varphi$ varied within the range $[50^\circ,150^\circ]$, the magnitudes of the CP asymmetries can be significantly enhanced relative to both the SM and the real case. In particular, the maximum absolute values of the CP asymmetries can even reach up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for these two decay modes, in the range $\varphi \in [70^\circ,100^\circ]$. These interesting observations could be utilized to discriminate the SM and the different scenarios of the A2HDM.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings in Froggatt-Nielsen flavour models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW) are a powerful probe of the earliest moments in the Universe, enabling us to test fundamental interactions at energy scales beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. In this work, we assess the GW capability to probe the origin of the flavour sector of the Standard Model (SM). Within the context of Froggatt-Nielsen models of fermion masses and mixing based on a gauged $U(1)$ flavour symmetry, we investigate the formation of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic GW background (GWB), estimating the sensitivity to the model's parameter space of future GW experiments. Comparing these results with the bounds from low-energy flavour observables, we find that these two types of experimental probes of the model are nicely complementary. Flavour physics observables can probe low to intermediate symmetry-breaking scales $v_\phi$, while future GW experiments are sensitive to the opposite regime, for which the string tension is large enough to yield sizeable GW signals, and in the long run can set an upper limit on the scale as stringent as $v_\phi \lesssim 10^9$ GeV. In certain scenarios, the combination of flavour constraints and future GW bounds can bring about a complete closure of the available parameter space, which illustrates how GWB searches can play an important role in testing the origin of the SM flavour sector even if that occurs at ultra-high energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-thermal production of the Higgsino dark matter (DM). Assuming that the lightest neutral Higgsino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in minimal supersymmetric standard model, we calculate the relic abundance of the Higgsino LSP produced by the decay of late-decaying scalar field. In the calculation of the relic abundance, we have properly included the effects of coannihilation as well as the non-perturbative effect (known as the Sommerfeld effect). Contrary to the case of the thermal-relic scenario, in which the observed DM abundance is realized with the Higgsino mass of ~ 1.2 TeV, Higgsino DM is possible with lighter Higgsino mass as the reheating temperature becomes lower than the Higgsino mass. The reheating temperature relevant for realizing the correct DM density is presented as a funciton of the Higgsino mass.</description>

Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently reported the observation of two new resonances, $X(1910)$ and $X(2300)$, which have sparked our interest in studying the light hadron family with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ . In this work, we investigate the mass spectra and OZI-allowed two-body strong decays of $b_1$, $h_1$, and $h_1^\prime$ using the MGI model and QPC model with newly fitted parameters. We also explore the possibility of identifying $X(1910)$ and $X(2300)$ as $h_1$ or $h_1^\prime$ states. Our numerical results suggest that $X(1910)$ could be a promising candidate for the $h_1^\prime(2^1P_1)$ state with quark content $s\bar{s}$, while the structure of $X(2300)$ remains uncertain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrepancy of approximately 5$\sigma$ exists between the two known results for the tenth-order QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, calculated from Feynman vertex diagrams without fermion loops. To investigate this, we decomposed this contribution into 389 parts based on a self-energy diagram representation, enabling a diagram-by-diagram numerical comparison of the two calculations. No significant discrepancies were found for individual diagrams. However, the numerical differences of the 98 diagrams sharing a common structure were not randomly distributed. The accumulation of these differences resulted in the 5$\sigma$ discrepancy. A recalculation with increased statistics in the Monte Carlo integration was performed for these 98 diagrams. By replacing the old values with the new ones for these 98 integrals, we have obtained a revised result of $6.800 \pm 0.128$, thereby resolving the discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Bridging massive and massless schemes for soft gluon resummation in heavy-flavour production in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative calculations for processes involving heavy flavours can be carried out using two approaches: the massive and the massless schemes. These schemes can also be combined to leverage their respective strengths. Additionally, both massive and massless frameworks can be supplemented by soft-gluon resummation. However, matching resummed calculations across the two schemes presents significant challenges, primarily due to the non-commutativity of the soft and small mass limits. The consistent resummation of mass and soft logarithms has been recently achieved at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy. In this paper, we consider heavy-quark fragmentation functions in electron-positron collisions and we extend this framework to achieve the so-called NLL$^\prime$ accuracy, which accounts for finite terms in the soft limit.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the Gauged Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (G2HDM), a framework that extends the Standard Model by introducing a dark sector governed by the gauge symmetry $U(1)_X \times SU(2)_H$. The full gauge symmetry of the theory, including the visible sector, is given by the universal covering group $\tilde{G} = U(1)_Y \times SU(2)_L \times SU(3)_C \times U(1)_X \times SU(2)_H$. However, the true gauge group may instead be a quotient $G = \tilde{G} / \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the center of $\tilde{G}$ or a subgroup thereof, leading to different global structures that cannot be distinguished by local experiments.We explore the physical implications of these global structures, analyzing their effects on Wilson, 't Hooft, and dyonic line operators, as well as the periodicity of the CP-violating $\theta$-angles associated with each group factor. Furthermore, we determine the minimal electric and magnetic charges that arise after electroweak symmetry breaking, highlighting their dependence on the choice of $\Gamma$. These findings provide a systematic characterization of the G2HDM's global properties and their potential phenomenological consequences.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the mass spectra and decay properties of bottomonium states using a relativistic screened potential model is carried out. The mass spectrum, decay constants, $E1$ transitions, $M1$ transitions, and annihilation decay widths are evaluated. The interpretation of $\Upsilon(10355)$, $\Upsilon(10580)$,$\Upsilon(10860)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$ as $S-D$ mixed bottomonium states are analysed. The $\Upsilon(10355)$ state is considered to be $3S-2D$, $\Upsilon(10580)$ state is considered to be $4S-3D$ mixed state, the $\Upsilon(10753)$ is obtained as purely $\Upsilon_{1}(3D)$ bottomonium state, and the $\Upsilon(10860)$ and $\Upsilon(11020)$ are deemed to be $5S-4D$ mixed states.</description>

      <title>Detecting Extragalactic Axion-like Dark Matter with Polarization Measurements of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates. A prevalent method to detect axion-like DM is to seek periodic oscillation in the polarization angles (PAs) of linearly polarized light emitted from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use the time-resolved polarization measurements of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20220912A, detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for extragalactic axion-like DM. Given a DM density profile of FRB 20220912A's host, we obtain upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant of $g_{a \gamma}&lt;(3.4 \times 10^{-11}-1.9\times 10^{-9})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-21}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Persistent polarimetric observations with FAST would extend the constraints to lower masses. Although the $g_{a \gamma}$ constraints derived from FRBs are less competitive than those from other methods, FRBs offer an alternative way to detect axion-like DM on extragalactic distance scales, complementary to galactic DM probes.</description>

      <title>Positivity properties of scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate positivity properties in quantum field theory (QFT). We provide evidence,and in some case proofs, that many building blocks of scattering amplitudes, and in some cases the full amplitudes, satisfy an infinite number of positivity conditions: the functions, as well as all their signed derivatives, are non-negative in a specified kinematic region. Such functions are known as completely monotonic(CM) in the mathematics literature. A powerful way to certify complete monotonicity is via integral representations. We thus show that it applies to planar and non-planar Feynman integrals possessing a Euclidean region,as well as to certain Euler integrals relevant to cosmological correlators and stringy integrals. This implies that in particular that many basic building blocks of perturbation theory, such as master integrals, can be chosen to be completely monotone. We also discuss two pathways for showing complete monotonicity for full amplitudes. One is related to properties of the analytic S-matrix. The other one is a close connection between the CM property and Positive Geometry. Motivated by this, we investigate positivity properties in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present evidence, based on known analytic multi-loop results, that the CM property extends to several physical quantities in this theory. This includes the (suitably normalized) finite remainder function of the six-particle maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitude, four-point scattering amplitudes on the Coulomb branch,four-point correlation functions, as well as the angle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. Our findings are however not limited to supersymmetric theories. It is shown that the CM property holds for the QCD and QED cusp anomalous dimensions, to three and four loops, respectively. We comment on open questions, and on possible numerical applications of complete monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy in Non-Supersymmetric Quasi-Realistic Heterotic-String Vacua with Fixed Moduli</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Baykara, Tarazi and Vafa discussed the existence of quasicrystalline string vacua that contain a single neutral moduli, the dilaton, and studied compactifications of the non-supersymmetric $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ heterotic-string on these spaces. We discuss a specific class of quasi-realistic string vacua with similar properties that has been known since the late eighties and analyse the vacuum energy in several non-supersymmetric examples that correspond to compactifications of tachyon free ten dimensional vacua as well as compactifications of tachyonic ten dimensional vacua. Our analysis uses the Free Fermionic Formalism of the heterotic-string in four dimensions and employs asymmetric boundary conditions that project all the geometrical moduli by Generalised GSO projections. This methodology produces models with both positive and negative spacetime potential at one-loop.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds, Significantly Limit Using Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many minimally coupled light scalars that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints.</description>

      <title>Condensate decay in a radiation dominated cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a homogeneous condensate of a massive scalar field of mass \emph{m} into massless fields in thermal equilibrium in a radiation dominated cosmology. The model is a \emph{proxy} for the non-equilibrium dynamics of a misaligned axion condensate decaying into radiation. After consistent field quantization in the cosmological background, we obtain the causal equations of motion for a homogeneous condensate including the finite temperature self-energy corrections up to one loop. The dynamical renormalization group is implemented to obtain the time dependent relaxation rate that describes the decay dynamics of the condensate amplitude from stimulated emission and recombination of massless quanta in the medium. It is explicitly shown that a simple friction term in the equation of motion does not describe correctly the decay of the condensate. During the super-Hubble regime, relevant for ultralight dark matter, the condensate amplitude decays as $e^{-\frac{g^2}{10} t^2\,\ln(1/mt)}$. In the sub-Hubble regime the amplitude decays as $e^{-\gamma(t;T(t))/2}$ with $T(t)=T_0/a(t)$, therefore the finite temperature contribution to the decay rate vanishes fast during the expansion. A main conclusion is that a phenomenological friction term is inadequate to describe the decay in the super-Hubble regime, the decay function $\gamma(t)$ is always \emph{smaller} than that from a local friction term as a consequence of the cosmological expansion. For ultra light dark matter, the time scale during which transient dynamics is sensitive to cosmological expansion and a local friction term is inadequate, is much longer. A friction term always \emph{underestimates} the time scale of decay in the sub-Hubble case.</description>

      <title>Light burden of memory: Constraining primordial black holes with high-energy neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist metastable domain walls of the flavor-singlet meson $\eta$ for the ${\rm U}(1)$ axial symmetry in two-flavor color superconductivity (2SC) in QCD at large baryon density. We show that, due to the coupling of $\eta$ to confined ${\rm SU}(2)$ gluons in the 2SC phase, the effective theory on the domain wall is described by the ${\rm SU}(2)_{-1}$ Chern-Simons theory, which is dual to the ${\rm U}(1)_{2}$ Chern-Simons theory. This theory has a spin-1 droplet excitation that does not carry a baryon number, which we identify as a vector meson. We also discuss the effective theories and baryonic droplet excitations on the domain walls of the flavor-singlet mesons in the superfluid phases of QCD at large isospin density and two-color QCD at large baryon density.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: To be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Towards a String Realization of the Dark Dimension via T-folds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave astronomy and the expansion history of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timeline of the expansion rate ultimately defines the interplay between high energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology. The guiding theme of this topical review is provided by the scrutiny of the early history of the space-time curvature through the diffuse backgrounds of gravitational radiation that are sensitive to all the stages of the evolution of the plasma. Due to their broad spectrum (extending from the aHz region to the THz domain) they bridge the macroworld described by general relativity and the microworld of the fundamental constituents of matter. It is argued that during the next score year the analysis of the relic gravitons may infirm or confirm the current paradigm where a radiation plasma is assumed to dominate the whole post-inflationary epoch. The role of high frequency and ultra-high frequency signals between the MHz and the THz is emphasized in the perspective of quantum sensing. The multiparticle final state of the relic gravitons and its macroscopic quantumness is also discussed with particular attention to the interplay between the entanglement entropy and the maximal frequency of the spectrum.</description>
