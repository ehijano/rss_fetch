      <title>A refined graph container lemma and applications to the hard-core model on bipartite expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a refined version of a graph container lemma due to Galvin and discuss several applications related to the hard-core model on bipartite expander graphs. Given a graph $G$ and $\lambda&gt;0$, the hard-core model on $G$ at activity $\lambda$ is the probability distribution $\mu_{G,\lambda}$ on independent sets in $G$ given by $\mu_{G,\lambda}(I)\propto \lambda^{|I|}$. As one of our main applications, we show that the hard-core model at activity $\lambda$ on the hypercube $Q_d$ exhibits a `structured phase' for $\lambda= \Omega( \log^2 d/d^{1/2})$ in the following sense: in a typical sample from $\mu_{Q_d,\lambda}$, most vertices are contained in one side of the bipartition of $Q_d$. This improves upon a result of Galvin which establishes the same for $\lambda=\Omega(\log d/ d^{1/3})$. As another application, we establish a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the hard-core model on a $d$-regular bipartite $\alpha$-expander, with $\alpha&gt;0$ fixed, when $\lambda= \Omega( \log^2 d/d^{1/2})$. This improves upon the bound $\lambda=\Omega(\log d/ d^{1/4})$ due to the first author, Perkins and Potukuchi. We discuss similar improvements to results of Galvin-Tetali, Balogh-Garcia-Li and Kronenberg-Spinka.</description>

      <title>On Dedekind's problem, a sparse version of Sperner's theorem, and antichains of a given size in the Boolean lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dedekind's problem, dating back to 1897, asks for the total number $\psi(n)$ of antichains contained in the Boolean lattice $B_n$ on $n$ elements. We study Dedekind's problem using a recently developed method based on the cluster expansion from statistical physics and as a result, obtain several new results on the number and typical structure of antichains in $B_n$. We obtain detailed estimates for both $\psi(n)$ and the number of antichains of size $\beta \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$ for any fixed $\beta&gt;0$. We also establish a sparse version of Sperner's theorem: we determine the sharp threshold and scaling window for the property that almost every antichain of size $m$ is contained in a middle layer of $B_n$.</description>

      <title>Remixed Eulerian numbers: beyond the connected case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his study of generalised permutahedra, Postnikov considered the mixed volumes of hypersimplices, giving rise to the family of mixed Eulerian numbers. It comprises usual Eulerian numbers, binomial coefficients, Catalan numbers, and the large family of hit numbers. Nadeau and Tewari further gave a polynomial refinement of these, the remixed Eulerian numbers, which recover the natural $q$-analogs of these special families. Using a probabilistic model, we give several formulas for remixed Eulerian numbers for certain subfamilies, extending the known formulas for $q$-hit numbers due to Garsia and Remmel.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Polynomials and Hypergraph Generating Functions via Heaps of Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a classical result due to Jacobi in algebraic combinatorics that the generating function of closed walks at a vertex $u$ in a graph $\mathcal{G}$ is determined by the rational function \[ \frac{\phi_{\mathcal{G}-u}(t)}{\phi_\mathcal{G}(t)} \] where $\phi_\mathcal{G}(t)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $\mathcal{G}$. In this paper, we show that the corresponding rational function for a hypergraph is also a generating function for some combinatorial objects in the hypergraph.
  We make use of the Heaps of Pieces framework, developed by Viennot, demonstrating its use on graphs, digraphs, and multigraphs before using it on hypergraphs. In the case of a graph $\mathcal{G}$, the pieces are cycles and the concurrence relation is sharing a vertex. The pyramids with maximal piece containing a vertex $u \in V(\mathcal{G})$ are in one-to-one correspondence with closed walks at $u$. In the case of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, connected ``infragraphs'' can be defined as the set of pieces, with the same concurrence relation: sharing a vertex. Our main results are established by analyzing multivariate resultants of polynomial systems associated to adjacency hypermatrices.</description>

      <title>Isolation partitions in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $k \geq 3$ an integer. A subset $D \subseteq V(G)$ is a $k$-clique (resp., cycle) isolating set of $G$ if $G-N[D]$ contains no $k$-clique (resp., cycle). In this paper, we prove that every connected graph with maximum degree at most $k$, except $k$-clique, can be partitioned into $k+1$ disjoint $k$-clique isolating sets, and that every connected claw-free subcubic graph, except 3-cycle, can be partitioned into four disjoint cycle isolating sets. As a consequence of the first result, every $k$-regular graph can be partitioned into $k+1$ disjoint $k$-clique isolating sets.</description>

      <title>Stabilities of intersecting families revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem states that for $n&gt; 2k$, every intersecting family of $k$-sets of $[n]:=\{1,\ldots ,n\}$ has at most $ {n-1 \choose k-1}$ sets, and the extremal family consists of all $k$-sets containing a fixed element (called a full star). The Hilton--Milner theorem provides a stability result by determining the maximum size of a uniform intersecting family that is not a subfamily of a full star. The further stabilities were studied by Han and Kohayakawa (2017) and Huang and Peng (2024). Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called cross-intersecting if for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$, the intersection $F\cap G$ is non-empty. Let $k \geq 1, t\ge 0$ and $n \geq 2 k+t$ be integers. Frankl (2016) proved that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, and $\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty and $(t+1)$-intersecting, then $|\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. Recently, Wu (2023) sharpened Frankl's result by establishing a stability variant. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Inspired by the above results, we first prove a further stability variant that generalizes both Frankl's result and Wu's result. Secondly, as an interesting application, we illustrate that the aforementioned results on cross-intersecting families could be used to establish the stability results of the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem. More precisely, we present new short proofs of the Hilton--Milner theorem, the Han--Kohayakawa theorem and the Huang--Peng theorem. Our arguments are more straightforward, and it may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Density and Symmetry in the Generalized Motzkin Numbers mod $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula for the density of $0$ in the sequence of generalized Motzkin numbers, $M^{a,b}_n$, modulo a prime, $p$, in terms of the first $p$ generalized central trinomial coefficients $T^{a,b}_n\mod p$ (with $n&lt;p$). We also prove that $T^{a,b}_{p-1-n}\equiv (b^2-4a^2)^{\frac{p-1}{2}-n}T^{a,b}_n\mod p$ in order to obtain a new lower bound of $\frac{2}{p(p-1)}$ for the density of $0$ in $M_n\mod p$, as well as a couple other applications including showing a novel symmetry of the first $p-2$ Motzkin numbers of independent interest: $M^{a,b}_{p-3-n}\equiv (b^2-4a^2)^{\frac{p-3}{2}-n}M^{a,b}_n\mod p$.</description>

Abstract: We obtain a novel formula for characteristic polynomials of deformations of the Braid arrangement using the notion of levels of regions. As an application, we recover and strengthen results of Chen et al. on the characteristic polynomial of several specific types of hyperplane arrangements via much simpler arguments. Our theorem also generalizes to type B.</description>

      <title>On the satisfiability of random $3$-SAT formulas with $k$-wise independent clauses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of identifying the satisfiability threshold of random $3$-SAT formulas has received a lot of attention during the last decades and has inspired the study of other threshold phenomena in random combinatorial structures. The classical assumption in this line of research is that, for a given set of $n$ Boolean variables, each clause is drawn uniformly at random among all sets of three literals from these variables, independently from other clauses. Here, we keep the uniform distribution of each clause, but deviate significantly from the independence assumption and consider richer families of probability distributions. For integer parameters $n$, $m$, and $k$, we denote by $\DistFamily_k(n,m)$ the family of probability distributions that produce formulas with $m$ clauses, each selected uniformly at random from all sets of three literals from the $n$ variables, so that the clauses are $k$-wise independent. Our aim is to make general statements about the satisfiability or unsatisfiability of formulas produced by distributions in $\DistFamily_k(n,m)$ for different values of the parameters $n$, $m$, and $k$.</description>

      <title>Functional tilings and the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coven and Meyerowitz formulated two conditions which have since been conjectured to characterize all finite sets that tile the integers by translation. By periodicity, this conjecture is reduced to sets which tile a finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_M$. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of this problem, where we replace sets with nonnegative functions $f,g$, such that $f(0)=g(0)=1$, $f\ast g=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Z}_M}$ is a functional tiling, and $f, g$ satisfy certain further natural properties associated with tilings. We show that the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions do not necessarily hold in such generality. Such examples of functional tilings carry the potential to lead to proper tiling counterexamples to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture in the future.</description>

      <title>Lattice paths and the diagonal of the cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lattice paths in the cube, starting at $(n,n,n)$ and ending at $(0,0,0)$, with unit steps $(-1,0,0)$, $(0,-1,0)$, $(0,0,-1)$. Our main interest is the number of times the diagonal $x=y=z$ is visited during the random walk. We derive the corresponding generating function of such lattice paths. We also turn to the cuboid, enumerating lattice paths starting at $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ and ending at $(0,0,0)$ according to the visits to the cube's diagonal. Furthermore, we provide for the cube a refined enumeration according to visits after a detour of a certain length. These enumerations allow us to obtain distributional results for the corresponding random variables. Extensions to hypercube are discussed, as well as a summary of known results for the square. We also show how to recover (and extend) a very recent result of Li and Starr on Dyck bridges using generating functions and composition schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of a graph is the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we investigate spread problems for graphs with excluded clique-minors. We show that for sufficiently large $n$, the $n$-vertex $K_r$-minor free graph with maximum spread is the join of a clique and an independent set, with $r-2$ and $n-r+2$ vertices, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Gram determinants of the Specht modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every partition $\lambda$ of a positive integer $n$, let $S^{\lambda}$ be the corresponding Specht module of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, and let $\det(\lambda)\in \mathbb Z$ denote the Gram determinant of the canonical bilinear form with respect to the standard basis of $S^{\lambda}$. Writing $\det(\lambda)=m \cdot 2^{a_{\lambda}^{(2)}}$ for integers $a_{\lambda}^{(2)}$ and $m$ with $m$ odd, we show that if the dimension of $S^{\lambda}$ is even, then $a_{\lambda}^{(2)}$ is also even. This confirms a conjecture posed by Richard Parker in the special case of the symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Chow functions for partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three decades ago, Stanley and Brenti initiated the study of the Kazhdan--Lusztig--Stanley (KLS) functions, putting on common ground several polynomials appearing in algebraic combinatorics, discrete geometry, and representation theory. In the present paper we develop a theory that parallels the KLS theory. To each kernel in a given poset, we associate a polynomial function that we call the \emph{Chow function}. The Chow function often exhibits remarkable properties, and sometimes encodes the graded dimensions of a cohomology or Chow ring. The framework of Chow functions provides natural polynomial analogs of graded module decompositions that appear in algebraic geometry, but that work for arbitrary posets, even when no graded module decomposition is known to exist. In this general framework, we prove a number of unimodality and positivity results without relying on versions of the Hard Lefschetz theorem. Our framework shows that there is an unexpected relation between positivity and real-rootedness conjectures about chains on face lattices of polytopes by Brenti and Welker, Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of matroid Chow rings by Ferroni and Schr\"oter, and flag enumerations on Bruhat intervals of Coxeter groups by Billera and Brenti.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous edge-colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalisation of Vizing's theorem, where the goal is to simultaneously colour the edges of graphs $G_1,\dots,G_k$ with few colours. We obtain asymptotically optimal bounds for the required number of colours in terms of the maximum degree $\Delta$, for small values of $k$ and for an infinite sequence of values of $k$. This asymptotically settles a conjecture of Cabello for $k=2$. Moreover, we show that $\sqrt k \Delta + o(\Delta)$ colours always suffice, which tends to the optimal value as $k$ grows. We also show that $\ell \Delta + o(\Delta)$ colours are enough when every edge appears in at most $\ell$ of the graphs, which asymptotically confirms a conjecture of Cambie. Finally, our results extend to the list setting. We also find a close connection to a conjecture of F\"uredi, Kahn, and Seymour from the 1990s and an old problem about fractional matchings.</description>

      <title>The monoid representation of upho posets and total positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all formal power series with integer coefficients and constant term $1$ are precisely the rank-generating functions of Schur-positive upho posets, thereby resolving the main conjecture proposed by Gao, Guo, Seetharaman, and Seidel. To achieve this, we construct a bijection between finitary colored upho posets and atomic, left-cancellative, invertible-free monoids, which restricts to a correspondence between $\mathbb{N}$-graded colored upho posets and left-cancellative homogeneous monoids. Furthermore, we introduce semi-upho posets and develop a convolution operation on colored upho posets with colored semi-upho posets within this monoid-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Is All You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Bencz\'ur and Karger demonstrated cut sparsifiers of near-linear size, with several applications throughout theoretical computer science. Subsequent extensions have yielded sparsifiers for hypergraph cuts and more recently linear codes over Abelian groups. A decade ago, Kogan and Krauthgamer asked about the sparsifiability of arbitrary constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). For this question, a trivial lower bound is the size of a non-redundant CSP instance, which admits, for each constraint, an assignment satisfying only that constraint (so that no constraint can be dropped by the sparsifier). For graph cuts, spanning trees are non-redundant instances.
  Our main result is that redundant clauses are sufficient for sparsification: for any CSP predicate R, every unweighted instance of CSP(R) has a sparsifier of size at most its non-redundancy (up to polylog factors). For weighted instances, we similarly pin down the sparsifiability to the so-called chain length of the predicate. These results precisely determine the extent to which any CSP can be sparsified. A key technical ingredient in our work is a novel application of the entropy method from Gilmer's recent breakthrough on the union-closed sets conjecture.
  As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, a number of results in the non-redundancy literature immediately extend to CSP sparsification. We also contribute new techniques for understanding the non-redundancy of CSP predicates. In particular, we give an explicit family of predicates whose non-redundancy roughly corresponds to the structure of matching vector families in coding theory. By adapting methods from the matching vector codes literature, we are able to construct an explicit predicate whose non-redundancy lies between $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ and $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.6})$, the first example with a provably non-integral exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study normal crossings compactifications of the moduli space of maps $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$, for $g = 0$ and $g = 1$. In each case we explicitly determine the dual boundary complex, and prove that it admits a natural interpretation as a moduli space of decorated metric graphs. We prove that the dual complexes are contractible when $r \geq 1$ and $d &gt; g$. When $g = 1$, our result depends on a new understanding of the connected components of boundary strata in the Vakil--Zinger desingularization and its modular interpretation by Ranganathan--Santos-Parker--Wise.</description>

      <title>Noisy Linear Group Testing: Exact Thresholds and Efficient Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In group testing, the task is to identify defective items by testing groups of them together using as few tests as possible. We consider the setting where each item is defective with a constant probability $\alpha$, independent of all other items. In the (over-)idealized noiseless setting, tests are positive exactly if any of the tested items are defective. We study a more realistic model in which observed test results are subject to noise, i.e., tests can display false positive or false negative results with constant positive probabilities. We determine precise constants $c$ such that $cn\log n$ tests are required to recover the infection status of every individual for both adaptive and non-adaptive group testing: in the former, the selection of groups to test can depend on previously observed test results, whereas it cannot in the latter. Additionally, for both settings, we provide efficient algorithms that identify all defective items with the optimal amount of tests with high probability. Thus, we completely solve the problem of binary noisy group testing in the studied setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting with an integral domain $D$ of characteristic $0$, we define recursively the wreath product $W_n$ of $n$ copies of $D$. For $W_n$ to be transfinite hypercentral, it is necessary to restrict to the class of wreath products defined by way of numerical polynomials. Building on results of Aragona et al., we explore the normalizer chain $\lbrace\mathfrak{N}_{i}\rbrace_{i\geq -1}$ starting from the canonical regular abelian subgroup $T$ of $W_n$, establishing an analogous connection between this chain and integer partitions with parts in $\lbrace 1,\dots,n-1\rbrace$. Additionally, we characterize the regular abelian normal subgroups of $\mathfrak{N}_0$ that are isomorphic to $D^n$ and we show that they form a single conjugacy class of subgroups if $2$ is invertible in $D$, or two otherwise.</description>

      <title>DP-Coloring of Graphs from Random Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) of graphs is a generalization of list coloring that has been widely studied since its introduction by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in $2015$. DP-coloring of a graph $G$ is equivalent to an independent transversal of a DP-cover of $G$. Intuitively, a $k$-fold DP-cover of a graph $G$ is an assignment of lists of size $k$ to the vertices of $G$ where the names of colors vary from edge to edge. In this paper, we introduce the notion of random DP-covers and study the behavior of DP-coloring from such random covers. We prove a series of results about the probability that a graph is or is not DP-colorable from a random cover. These results support the following threshold behavior on random $k$-fold DP-covers as $\rho\to\infty$ where $\rho$ is the maximum density of a graph: graphs are non-DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently smaller than $\rho/\ln\rho$, and graphs are DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently larger than $\rho/\ln\rho$. Our results depend on $\rho$ growing fast enough and imply a sharp threshold for dense enough graphs. For sparser graphs, we analyze DP-colorability in terms of degeneracy. We also prove fractional DP-coloring analogs to these results.</description>

Abstract: Lopsp-operations are operations on maps that are applied locally and are guaranteed to preserve all the orientation-preserving symmetries of maps. Well-known examples of such operations are dual, ambo, truncation, and leapfrog. They are described by plane 3-coloured triangulations with specific properties. We developed and implemented a program that can generate all lopsp-operations of a given size by reducing the problem of generating lopsp-operations to generating all plane quadrangulations that are not necessarily simple. We extended the program plantri to generate these quadrangulations.</description>

Abstract: The Schubert problem asks for combinatorial models to compute structure constants of the cohomology ring with respect to the Schubert classes, and has been an important open problem in algebraic geometry and combinatorics that guided fruitful research in decades. In this paper, we provide an explicit formula for the (equivariant) Schubert structure constants $c_{uv}^w$ across all Lie types when the elements $u,v,w$ are boolean. In particular, in type $A$, all Schubert structure constants on boolean elements are either $0$ or $1$.</description>

This improves the earlier bound of $\lfloor\frac{2}{3}n\rfloor$ due to Foucaud, Henning, L\"owenstein and Sasse from 2016, and makes some progress towards the well-studied locating-dominating conjecture of Garijo, Gonz\'alez and M\'arquez.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.07544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyclotomic polynomials are basic objects in Number Theory. Their properties depend on the number of distinct primes that intervene in the factorization of their order, and the binary case is thus the first nontrivial case. This paper sees the vector of coefficients of the polynomial as a word on a ternary alphabet $\{-1,0 ,+1\}$. It designs an efficient algorithm that computes a compact representation of this word. This algorithm is of linear time with respect to the size of the output, and, thus, optimal. This approach allows to recover known properties of coefficients of binary cyclotomic polynomials, and extends to the case of polynomials associated with numerical semi-groups of dimension 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $g\ge 2$ and $n\ge 0$, let $\mathcal{H}_{g,n}\subset \mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ denote the complex moduli stack of $n$-marked smooth hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$. A normal crossings compactification of this space is provided by the theory of pointed admissible $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-covers. We explicitly determine the resulting dual complex, and we use this to define a graph complex which computes the weight zero compactly supported cohomology of $\mathcal{H}_{g, n}$. Using this graph complex, we give a sum-over-graphs formula for the $S_n$-equivariant weight zero compactly supported Euler characteristic of $\mathcal{H}_{g, n}$. This formula allows for the computer-aided calculation, for each $g\le 7$, of the generating function $\mathsf{h}_g$ for these equivariant Euler characteristics for all $n$. More generally, we determine the dual complex of the boundary in any moduli space of pointed admissible $G$-covers of genus zero curves, when $G$ is abelian, as a symmetric $\Delta$-complex. We use these complexes to generalize our formula for $\mathsf{h}_g$ to moduli spaces of $n$-pointed smooth abelian covers of genus zero curves.</description>

      <title>Fourier Analysis of Iterative Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of nonlinear iterative algorithms which includes power iteration, belief propagation and approximate message passing, and many forms of gradient descent. When the input is a random matrix with i.i.d. entries, we use Boolean Fourier analysis to analyze these algorithms as low-degree polynomials in the entries of the input matrix. Each symmetrized Fourier character represents all monomials with a certain shape as specified by a small graph, which we call a Fourier diagram.
  We prove fundamental asymptotic properties of the Fourier diagrams: over the randomness of the input, all diagrams with cycles are negligible; the tree-shaped diagrams form a basis of asymptotically independent Gaussian vectors; and, when restricted to the trees, iterative algorithms exactly follow an idealized Gaussian dynamic. We use this to prove a state evolution formula, giving a "complete" asymptotic description of the algorithm's trajectory.
  The restriction to tree-shaped monomials mirrors the assumption of the cavity method, a 40-year-old non-rigorous technique in statistical physics which has served as one of the most important techniques in the field. We demonstrate how to implement cavity method derivations by 1) restricting the iteration to its tree approximation, and 2) observing that heuristic cavity method-type arguments hold rigorously on the simplified iteration. Our proofs use combinatorial arguments similar to the trace method from random matrix theory.
  Finally, we push the diagram analysis to a number of iterations that scales with the dimension $n$ of the input matrix, proving that the tree approximation still holds for a simple variant of power iteration all the way up to $n^{\Omega(1)}$ iterations.</description>

      <title>The Converse of the Real Orthogonal Holant Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Holant theorem is a powerful tool for studying the computational complexity of counting problems in the Holant framework. Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of symmetric tensors.</description>

Abstract: We treat three cubic recurrences, two of which generalize the famous iterated map $x \mapsto x (1-x)$ from discrete chaos theory. A feature of each asymptotic series developed here is a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>
