      <title>Homogeneous Patterns in Ramsey Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we study a homogeneous version of some nonlinear Ramsey theoretic results with three applications.
  As a first application, we prove that for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{Z}^+$, there exists an infinite set $A$ and an arbitrarily large finite set $B$ such that $A\cup (A+B)\cup A\cdot B$ is monochromatic, which answers the finitary version of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson's question asking whether $(A+B)\cup A\cdot B$ is partition regular for infinite sets $A,B$, closely related to a question of Erd\H{o}s.
  As a second application, we made a progress related to a nonlinear extension of the partition regularity of Pythagorean triples, where we prove that the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2+P(u_1,\cdots ,u_n)$ is $2$-regular for some suitable polynomials $P$ of any desired degree.
  Finally, as a third application, we prove a nonlinear version of Rado's conjecture on the degree of regularity. We prove for every $m,n\in \mathbb{Z}^+,$ there exists an $m$-degree homogeneous equation which is $n$-regular but not $n+1$-regular; the case $m=1$ was Rado's conjecture first proved by Alexeev and Tsimerman, and later independently by Golowich.</description>

      <title>When alcoved polytopes add</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alcoved polytopes are characterized by the property that all facet normal directions are parallel to the roots $e_i-e_j$. Unlike other prominent families of polytopes, like generalized permutahedra, alcoved polytopes are not closed under Minkowski sums. We nonetheless show that the Minkowski sum of a collection of alcoved polytopes is alcoved if and only if each pairwise sum is alcoved. This implies that the type fan of alcoved polytopes is determined by its two-dimensional cones. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of when the Minkowski sum of alcoved simplices is again alcoved via a graphical criterion on pairs of ordered set partitions. Our characterization reduces to checking conditions on restricted partitions of length at most six. In particular, we show how the Minkowski sum decompositions of the two most well-known families of alcoved polytopes, the associahedron and the cyclohedron, fit in our framework. Additionally, inspired by the physical construction of one-loop scattering amplitudes, we present a new infinite family of alcoved polytopes, called $\widehat{D}_n$ polytopes. We conclude by drawing a connection to matroidal blade arrangements and the Dressian.</description>

      <title>Twenty years of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il's classification programme of Ramsey classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s, structural Ramsey theory emerged as a new branch of combinatorics. This development came with the isolation of the concepts of the $\mathbf{A}$-Ramsey property and Ramsey class. Following the influential Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il-R\"{o}dl theorem, several Ramsey classes have been identified. In the 1980s Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, inspired by a seminar of Lachlan, discovered a crucial connection between Ramsey classes and Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} classes and, in his 1989 paper, connected the classification programme of homogeneous structures to structural Ramsey theory. In 2005, Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'{c} revitalized the field by connecting Ramsey classes to topological dynamics. This breakthrough motivated Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il to propose a program for classifying Ramsey classes. We review the progress made on this program in the past two decades, list open problems, and discuss recent extensions to new areas, namely the extension property for partial automorphisms (EPPA), and big Ramsey structures.</description>

      <title>Locally chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is locally chordal if, locally at each vertex, it is chordal, i.e. composed of cliques glued along a tree. In addition to extending many classic characterizations of chordal graphs, we show that locally chordal graphs are precisely those graphs $G$ which can be decomposed into cliques arranged in the shape of a high-girth graph. The decomposition in the shape of a high-girth graph simultaneously witnesses that $G$ is, locally at each vertex, composed of cliques glued along a tree. We also show that these decompositions can be computed efficiently. Our analysis of locally chordal graphs is inspired by a recent framework to study local vs. global structure in graphs [DJKK22].</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation Guided Decimation on Random k-XORSAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the performance of Belief Propagation Guided Decimation, a physics-inspired message passing algorithm, on the random $k$-XORSAT problem. Specifically, we derive an explicit threshold up to which the algorithm succeeds with a strictly positive probability $\Omega(1)$ that we compute explicitly, but beyond which the algorithm with high probability fails to find a satisfying assignment. In addition, we analyse a thought experiment called the decimation process for which we identify a (non-) reconstruction and a condensation phase transition. The main results of the present work confirm physics predictions from [RTS: J. Stat. Mech. 2009] that link the phase transitions of the decimation process with the performance of the algorithm, and improve over partial results from a recent article [Yung: Proc. ICALP 2024].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White's conjecture predicts quadratic generators for the ideal of any matroid base polytope. We prove that White's conjecture for any matroid $M$ implies it also for any matroid $M'$, where $M$ and $M'$ differ by one basis. Our study is motivated by inner projections of algebraic varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $M$ is a matroid, then a simple matroid $M'$ with the same rank as $M$ is an adjoint of $M$ if there is an inclusion-reversing embedding $\phi$ of the lattice of flats of $M$ into the lattice of flats of $M'$ such that $\phi$ maps the hyperplanes of $M$ bijectively onto the points of $M'$. In this note, we provide a proof that the class of matroids with an adjoint is minor-closed.</description>

      <title>Domino Tilings, Domino Shuffling, and the Nabla Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study domino tilings of certain regions $R_\lambda$, indexed by partitions $\lambda$, weighted according to generalized area and dinv statistics. These statistics arise from the $q,t$-Catalan combinatorics and Macdonald polynomials. We present a formula for the generating polynomial of these domino tilings in terms of the Bergeron--Garsia nabla operator. When $\lambda = (n^n)$ is a square shape, domino tilings of $R_\lambda$ are equivalent to those of the Aztec diamond of order $n$. In this case, we give a new product formula for the resulting polynomials by domino shuffling and its connection with alternating sign matrices. In particular, we obtain a combinatorial proof of the joint symmetry of the generalized area and dinv statistics.</description>

      <title>The typical structure of dense claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic number and typical structure of claw-free graphs at constant edge densities. The first of our main results is a formula for the asymptotics of the logarithm of the number of claw-free graphs of edge density $\gamma \in (0,1)$. We show that the problem exhibits a second-order phase transition at edge density $\gamma^\ast=\frac{5-\sqrt{5}}{4}$. The asymptotic formula arises by solving a variational problem over graphons. For $\gamma\geq\gamma^\ast$ there is a unique optimal graphon, while for $\gamma&lt;\gamma^\ast$ there is an infinite set of optimal graphons. By analyzing more detailed structure, we prove that for $\gamma&lt;\gamma^\ast$, there is in fact a unique graphon $W$ such that almost all claw-free graphs at edge density $\gamma$ are close in cut metric to $W$. We also analyze the probability of claw-freeness in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for constant $p$, obtaining a formula for the large-deviation rate function for claw-freeness. In this case, the problem exhibits a first-order phase transition at $p^\ast=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}$, separating distinct structural regimes. At the critical point $p^\ast$, the corresponding graphon variational problem has infinitely many solutions, and we again pinpoint a unique optimal graphon that describes the typical structure of $G(n,p^\ast)$ conditioned on being claw-free.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>

      <title>Using Code Generation to Solve Open Instances of Combinatorial Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Handbook of Combinatorial Designs catalogs many types of combinatorial designs, together with lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been determined. We develop a constructive protocol CPro1, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code that constructs combinatorial designs and resolves some of these open instances. The protocol starts from a definition of a particular type of design, and a verifier that reliably confirms whether a proposed design is valid. The LLM selects strategies and implements them in code, and scaffolding provides automated hyperparameter tuning and execution feedback using the verifier. Most generated code fails, but by generating many candidates, the protocol automates exploration of a variety of standard methods (e.g. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) and experimentation with variations (e.g. cost functions) to find successful approaches. Testing on 16 different types of designs, CPro1 constructs solutions to open instances for 6 of them: Symmetric and Skew Weighing Matrices, Equidistant Permutation Arrays, Packing Arrays, Balanced Ternary Designs, and Florentine Rectangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies several decoding algorithms for hyperbolic codes. We use some previous ideas to describe how to decode a hyperbolic code using the largest Reed-Muller code contained in it or using the smallest Reed-Muller code that contains it. A combination of these two algorithms is proposed when hyperbolic codes are defined by polynomials in two variables. Then, we compare hyperbolic codes and Cube codes (tensor product of Reed-Solomon codes) and propose decoding algorithms of hyperbolic codes based on their closest Cube codes. Finally, we adapt to hyperbolic codes the Geil and Matsumoto's generalization of Sudan's list decoding algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit for exponentiation of Hamiltonians: an algorithmic description based on tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponentiation of Hamiltonians refers to a mathematical operation to a Hamiltonian operator, typically in the form e^(-i.t.H), where H is the Hamiltonian and t is a time parameter. This operation is fundamental in quantum mechanics, particularly to evolve quantum systems over time according to the Schrodinger equation.
  In quantum algorithms, such as Adiabatic methods and QAOA, exponentiation enables efficient simulation of a system dynamics.
  It involves constructing quantum circuits that approximate this exponential operation. When H=\sum_(p=1)^n H_p , each H_p is defined using the Pauli operator basis, which includes the well-known X, Y, Z and Id gates, i.e., H_p=U_1\otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n and U_k\in{Id,X,Y,Z}. In this article, we explore the exponentiation of H_p, specifically e^(-i.t.U_1 \otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n ), by introducing an algorithmic approach. We demonstrate a straightforward and efficient method to construct compact circuits that are easy to implement.</description>

Abstract: We consider the single-conflict coloring problem, a graph coloring problem in which each edge of a graph receives a forbidden ordered color pair. The task is to find a vertex coloring such that no two adjacent vertices receive a pair of colors forbidden at an edge joining them. We show that for any assignment of forbidden color pairs to the edges of a $d$-degenerate graph $G$ on $n$ vertices of edge-multiplicity at most $\log \log n$, $O(\sqrt{ d } \log n)$ colors are always enough to color the vertices of $G$ in a way that avoids every forbidden color pair. This answers a question of Dvo\v{r}\'ak, Esperet, Kang, and Ozeki for simple graphs (Journal of Graph Theory 2021).</description>

      <title>A combinatorial characterization of $S_2$ binomial edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several algebraic properties of a binomial edge ideal $J_G$ can be interpreted in terms of combinatorial properties of its associated graph $G$. In particular, the so-called cut sets of a graph $G$, special sets of vertices that disconnect $G$ in a minimal way, play an important role since they are in bijection with the minimal prime ideals of $J_G$. In this paper we establish the first graph-theoretical characterization of binomial edge ideals $J_G$ satisfying Serre's condition $(S_2)$ by proving that this is equivalent to having $G$ accessible, which means that $J_G$ is unmixed and the cut sets of $G$ form an accessible set system. The proof relies on the combinatorial structure of the Stanley-Reisner simplicial complex of a multigraded generic initial ideal of $J_G$, whose facets can be described in terms of cut sets. Another key step in the proof consists in proving the equivalence between accessibility and strong accessibility for the collection of cut sets of $G$ with $J_G$ unmixed. This result, interesting on its own, provides the first relevant class of set systems for which the previous two notions are equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The order and chain polytopes, introduced by Richard P. Stanley, form a pair of Ehrhart equivalent polytopes associated to a given finite poset. A conjecture by Takayuki Hibi and Nan Li states that the $f$-vector of the chain polytope dominates the $f$-vector of the order polytope. In this paper we prove a stronger form of that conjecture for a special class of posets. More precisely, we show that the $f$-vectors increase monotonically over an admissible family of chain-order polytopes for such posets.</description>

      <title>Tight Hamilton cycles with high discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study discrepancy questions for spanning subgraphs of $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Our main result is that, for any integers $k \ge 3$ and $r \ge 2$, any $r$-colouring of the edges of a $k$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraph $G$ with minimum $(k-1)$-degree $\delta(G) \ge (1/2+o(1))n$ contains a tight Hamilton cycle with high discrepancy, that is, with at least $n/r+\Omega(n)$ edges of one colour. The minimum degree condition is asymptotically best possible and our theorem also implies a corresponding result for perfect matchings. Our tools combine various structural techniques such as Tur\'an-type problems and hypergraph shadows with probabilistic techniques such as random walks and the nibble method. We also propose several intriguing problems for future research.</description>

      <title>On a q-analogue of the Zeta polynomial of posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a q-analogue of the classical Zeta polynomial of  finite partially ordered sets, as a polynomial in one variable x  with coefficients depending on the indeterminate q. We prove some  properties of this polynomial invariant, including its behaviour  with respect to duality, product and disjoint union. The leading  term is a q-analogue of the number of maximal chains, but not  always with non-negative coefficients. The value at q=0 turns out  to be essentially the characteristic polynomial.</description>

      <title>Graph Burning: Bounds and Hardness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an undirected graph $G$, graph burning is defined as follows: at step $t=0$ all vertices in $G$ are unburned. At each step $t\ge 1$, one new unburned vertex is selected to burn until we exhaust all the vertices. If a vertex is burned at step $t$, then all its unburned neighbors are burned in step $t+1$, and the process continues until there are no unburned vertices in $G$. The burning number of a graph $G$, denoted by $b(G)$, is the minimum number of steps required to burn all the vertices of $G$. The Burning Number problem asks whether the burning number of an input graph $G$ is at most $k$ or not. In this paper, we study the Burning Number problem both from an algorithmic and a structural point of view. The Burning Number problem is known to be NP-complete for trees with maximum degree at most three and interval graphs. Here, we prove that this problem is NP-complete even when restricted to connected cubic graphs and connected proper interval graphs. The well-known burning number conjecture asserts that all the vertices of a graph of order $n$ can be burned in $\lceil \sqrt{n}~\rceil$ steps. In line with this conjecture, upper and lower bounds of $b(G)$ are well-studied for various graph classes. Here, we provide an improved upper bound for the burning number of connected $P_k$-free graphs and show that the bound is tight up to an additive constant $1$. Finally, we study two variants of the problem, namely edge burning (only edges are burned) and total burning (both vertices and edges are burned). In particular, we establish their relationship with the burning number problem and evaluate the algorithmic complexity of these variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schubert polynomials represent a basis for the cohomology of the complete flag variety and thus play a central role in geometry and combinatorics. In this context, Schubert polynomials are generating functions over various combinatorial objects, such as rc-graphs or reduced pipe dreams. By restricting Bergeron and Billey's chute moves on rc-graphs, we define a Demazure crystal structure on the monomials of a Schubert polynomial. As a consequence, we provide a method for decomposing Schubert polynomials as sums of key polynomials, complementing related work of Assaf and Schilling via reduced factorizations with cutoff, as well as Lenart's coplactic operators on biwords.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

      <title>Pattern-avoiding shallow permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shallow permutations were defined in 1977 to be those that satisfy the lower bound of the Diaconis-Graham inequality. Recently, there has been renewed interest in these permutations. In particular, Berman and Tenner showed they satisfy certain pattern avoidance conditions in their cycle form and Woo showed they are exactly those whose cycle diagrams are unlinked. Shallow permutations that avoid 321 have appeared in many contexts; they are those permutations for which depth equals the reflection length, they have unimodal cycles, and they have been called Boolean permutations. Motivated by this interest in 321-avoiding shallow permutations, we investigate $\sigma$-avoiding shallow permutations for all $\sigma \in \mathcal{S}_3$. To do this, we develop more general structural results about shallow permutations, and apply them to enumerate shallow permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3.</description>

      <title>Forcing Quasirandomness in a Regular Tournament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tournament $H$ is said to force quasirandomness if it has the property that a sequence $(T_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of tournaments of increasing orders is quasirandom if and only if the homomorphism density of $H$ in $T_n$ tends to $(1/2)^{\binom{v(H)}{2}}$ as $n\to\infty$. It was recently shown that there is only one non-transitive tournament with this property. This is in contrast to the analogous problem for graphs, where there are numerous graphs that are known to force quasirandomness and the well known Forcing Conjecture suggests that there are many more. To obtain a richer family of characterizations of quasirandomness in tournaments, we propose a variant in which the tournaments $(T_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ are assumed to be "nearly regular." We characterize the tournaments on at most 5 vertices which force quasirandomness under this stronger assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of pattern avoidance in rectangulations. We give a formal definition of such patterns and investigate rectangulations that avoid $\top$-like patterns - the pattern $\top$ and its rotations. For every $L \subseteq \{\top, \, \vdash, \, \bot, \, \dashv \}$ we enumerate $L$-avoiding rectangulations, both weak and strong. In particular, we show $\top$-avoiding weak rectangulations are enumerated by Catalan numbers and construct bijections to several Catalan structures. Then, we prove that $\top$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with several classes of inversion sequences, among them $I(010,101,120,201)$ and $I(011,201)$ - which leads to a solution of the conjecture that these classes are Wilf-equivalent. Finally, we show that $\{\top, \bot\}$-avoiding strong rectangulations are in bijection with recently introduced rushed Dyck paths.</description>

Abstract: We establish a theorem regarding the maximum size of an {\it{induced}} matching in the bipartite complement of the incidence graph of a set system $(X,\mathcal{F})$. We show that this quantity plus one provides an upper bound on the colorful Helly number of this set system, i.e. the minimum positive integer $N$ for which the following statement holds: if finite subfamilies $\mathcal{F}_1,\ldots, \mathcal{F}_{N} \subset \mathcal{F}$ are such that $\cap_{F \in \mathcal{F}_{i}} F = 0$ for every $i=1,\ldots,N$, then there exists $F_i \in \mathcal{F}_i$ such that $F_1 \cap \ldots \cap F_{N} = \emptyset$. We will also discuss some natural refinements of this result and applications.</description>

      <title>On Ordinal Invariants in Well Quasi Orders and Finite Antichain Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.00428v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ordinal invariants height, length, and width of well quasi orders (WQO), with particular emphasis on width, an invariant of interest for the larger class of orders with finite antichain condition (FAC). We show that the width in the class of FAC orders is completely determined by the width in the class of WQOs, in the sense that if we know how to calculate the width of any WQO then we have a procedure to calculate the width of any given FAC order. We show how the width of WQO orders obtained via some classical constructions can sometimes be computed in a compositional way. In particular, this allows proving that every ordinal can be obtained as the width of some WQO poset. One of the difficult questions is to give a complete formula for the width of Cartesian products of WQOs. Even the width of the product of two ordinals is only known through a complex recursive formula. Although we have not given a complete answer to this question we have advanced the state of knowledge by considering some more complex special cases and in particular by calculating the width of certain products containing three factors. In the course of writing the paper we have discovered that some of the relevant literature was written on cross-purposes and some of the notions re-discovered several times. Therefore we also use the occasion to give a unified presentation of the known results.
  ERRATUM:We incorrectly claimed in Lemma 4.4(1) the formula $o(P\cdot Q)=o(P)\cdot o(Q)$ for wpos $P$ and $Q$ and incorrectly attributed it to Abraham and Bonnet. We incorrectly claimed in 4.4(2) that the formula for $h(P\cdot Q)$ was due to Abraham and Bonnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the open problem concerning the possible lack of concentration of the degree distribution in preferential attachment graphs with random initial degree, when its distribution is characterized by extremely heavy tails of power-law type. We show that the addition of such a large number of edges causes a significant upset of the degree distribution, leading to its non-concentration. Furthermore, we show that the smallest value of the exponent for which the degree distribution exhibits concentration is 2.</description>

Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they overlook the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as ``In 50% of the cases, no one in group 1 gets the information, while everyone in group 2 does, and in the other 50%, it is the opposite'', which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed-selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.</description>

      <title>A note on congruences for generalized cubic partitions modulo primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced the notion of a generalized cubic partition function $a_c(n)$ and proved two isolated congruences via modular forms, namely, $a_3(7n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_5(11n+10)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$. In this paper, we provide another proof of these congruences by using classical $q$-series manipulations. We also give infinite families of congruences for $a_c(n)$ for primes $p\not\equiv 1\pmod{8}$.</description>

      <title>On the Genus of One Degree of Freedom Planar Linkages via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying the configuration spaces of graphs realised in $\mathbb C^2$, such that the configuration space is, after normalisation, one dimensional. If this is the case, then the configuration space is, generically, a smooth complex curve, and can be seen as a Riemann surface. The property of interest in this paper is the genus of this curve. Using tropical geometry, we give an algorithm to compute this genus. We provide an implementation in Python and give various examples.</description>

      <title>Jordan Type stratification of spaces of commuting nilpotent matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $n\times n$ nilpotent matrix $B$ is determined up to conjugacy by a partition $P_B$ of $n$, its Jordan type given by the sizes of its Jordan blocks. The Jordan type $\mathfrak D(P)$ of a nilpotent matrix in the dense orbit of the nilpotent commutator of a given nilpotent matrix of Jordan type $P$ is stable - has parts differing pairwise by at least two - and was determined by R. Basili. The second two authors, with B. Van Steirteghem and R. Zhao determined a rectangular table of partitions $\mathfrak D^{-1}(Q)$ having a given stable partition $Q$ as the Jordan type of its maximum nilpotent commutator. They proposed a box conjecture, that would generalize the answer to stable partitions $Q$ having $\ell$ parts: it was proven recently by J.~Irving, T. Ko\v{s}ir and M. Mastnak.
  Using this result and also some tropical calculations, the authors here determine equations defining the loci of each partition in $\mathfrak D^{-1}(Q)$, when $Q$ is stable with two parts. The equations for each locus form a complete intersection. The authors propose a conjecture generalizing their result to arbitrary stable $Q$.</description>

      <title>The homological shift algebra of a monomial ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $K$, and let $I\subset S$ be a monomial ideal. In this paper, we introduce the $i$th homological shift algebras $\text{HS}_i(\mathcal{R}(I))=S\oplus\bigoplus_{k\ge1}\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ of $I$. These algebras have the structure of a finitely generated bigraded module over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. Hence, many invariants of $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$, such as depth, associated primes, regularity, and the $\text{v}$-number, exhibit well behaved asymptotic behavior. We particularly investigate $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ when $I$ has linear powers, and determine several families of monomial ideals $I$ for which $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ has linear resolution for all $k\gg0$. Finally, we show that $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ is Golod for all monomial ideals $I\subset S$ and all $k\gg0$.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals and their asymptotic syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph, and let $I(G)$ denote its edge ideal. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the syzygies of powers of edge ideals through the lens of homological shift ideals $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$. We introduce the notion of the $i$th homological strong persistence property for monomial ideals $I$, providing an algebraic characterization that ensures the chain of inclusions $\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^2)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^3) \subseteq\cdots$. We prove that edge ideals possess both the 0th and 1st homological strong persistence properties. To this end, we explicitly describe the first homological shift algebra of $I(G)$ and show that $\text{HS}_1(I(G)^{k+1}) = I(G) \cdot \text{HS}_1(I(G)^k)$ for all $k \ge 1$. Finally, we conjecture that if $I(G)$ has a linear resolution, then $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$ also has a linear resolution for all $k \gg 0$, and we present partial results supporting this conjecture.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary $O(1)$ operations on recursive lists. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. While permutations are generated in an unusual order, the transitions between consecutive permutations remain smooth. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>
