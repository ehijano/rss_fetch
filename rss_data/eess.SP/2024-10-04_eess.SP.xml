      <title>Context-Aware Predictive Coding: A Representation Learning Framework for WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi sensing is an emerging technology that utilizes wireless signals for various sensing applications. However, the reliance on supervised learning, the scarcity of labelled data, and the incomprehensible channel state information (CSI) pose significant challenges. These issues affect deep learning models' performance and generalization across different environments. Consequently, self-supervised learning (SSL) is emerging as a promising strategy to extract meaningful data representations with minimal reliance on labelled samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel SSL framework called Context-Aware Predictive Coding (CAPC), which effectively learns from unlabelled data and adapts to diverse environments. CAPC integrates elements of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and the augmentation-based SSL method, Barlow Twins, promoting temporal and contextual consistency in data representations. This hybrid approach captures essential temporal information in CSI, crucial for tasks like human activity recognition (HAR), and ensures robustness against data distortions. Additionally, we propose a unique augmentation, employing both uplink and downlink CSI to isolate free space propagation effects and minimize the impact of electronic distortions of the transceiver. Our evaluations demonstrate that CAPC not only outperforms other SSL methods and supervised approaches, but also achieves superior generalization capabilities. Specifically, CAPC requires fewer labelled samples while significantly outperforming supervised learning and surpassing SSL baselines. Furthermore, our transfer learning studies on an unseen dataset with a different HAR task and environment showcase an accuracy improvement of 1.8 percent over other SSL baselines and 24.7 percent over supervised learning, emphasizing its exceptional cross-domain adaptability.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter with Noise Covariance Tuning for Attitude Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude estimation is crucial in aerospace engineering, robotics, and virtual reality applications, but faces difficulties due to nonlinear system dynamics and sensor limitations. This paper addresses the challenge of attitude estimation using quaternion-based adaptive right invariant extended Kalman filtering (RI-EKF) that integrates data from inertial and magnetometer sensors. Our approach applies the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate noise covariance, exploiting RI-EKF symmetry properties. We analyze the adaptive RI-EKF's stability, convergence, and accuracy, validating its performance through simulations and comparison with the left invariant EKF. Monte Carlo simulations validate the effectiveness of our noise covariance estimation technique across various window lengths.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Temporal Decorrelation of State Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many commercial and defense applications involve multisensor, multitarget tracking, requiring the fusion of information from a set of sensors. An interesting use case occurs when data available at a central node (due to geometric diversity or retrodiction) allows for the tailoring of state estimation for a target. For instance, if a target is initially tracked with a maneuvering target filter, yet the target is clearly not maneuvering in retrospect, it would be beneficial at the fusion node to refilter that data with a non-maneuvering target filter. If measurements can be shared to the central node, the refiltering process can be accomplished by simply passing source measurements through an updated state estimation process. It is often the case for large, distributed systems, however, that only track information can be passed to a fusion center. In this circumstance, refiltering data becomes less straightforward as track states are linearly dependent across time, and the correlation needs to be properly accounted for before/during refiltering. In this work, a model-based temporal decorrelation process for state estimates with process noise will be studied. A decorrelation procedure will be presented based on a linear algebraic formulation of the problem, and process noise estimates will be created that ensure a conservative system state estimate. Numerical examples will be given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>GNN-Enabled Optimization of Placement and Transmission Design for UAV Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies graph neural networks (GNN) in UAV communications to optimize the placement and transmission design. We consider a multiple-user multiple-input-single-output UAV communication system where a UAV intends to find a placement to hover and serve users with maximum energy efficiency (EE). To facilitate the GNN-based learning, we adopt the hybrid maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing scheme to design the beamforming vectors and a feature augment is implemented by manually setting edge features. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage GNN-based model where the first stage and the second stage yield the placement and the transmission design, respectively. The two stages are connected via a residual and their learnable weights are jointly optimized by via unsupervised learning. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness and validate the scalability to both UAV antennas and users of the proposed model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates deep learning enabled beamforming design for ultra-dense wireless networks by integrating prior knowledge and graph neural network (GNN), named model-based GNN. A energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to power budget and quality of service (QoS) requirements, which is reformulated based on the minimum mean square error scheme and the hybrid zero-forcing and maximum ratio transmission schemes. Based on the reformulated problem, the model-based GNN to realize the mapping from channel state information to beamforming vectors. Particular, the multi-head attention mechanism and residual connection are adopted to enhance the feature extracting, and a scheme selection module is designed to improve the adaptability of GNN. The unsupervised learning is adopted, and a various-input training strategy is proposed to enhance the stability of GNN. Numerical results demonstrate the millisecond-level response with limited performance loss, the scalability to different users and the adaptability to various channel conditions and QoS requirements of the model-based GNN in ultra-dense wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Self-Trained Channel State Prediction Method for mmWave Vehicular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing and maintaining 5G mmWave vehicular connectivity poses a significant challenge due to high user mobility that necessitates frequent triggering of beam switching procedures. Departing from reactive beam switching based on the user device channel state feedback, proactive beam switching prepares in advance for upcoming beam switching decisions by exploiting accurate channel state information (CSI) prediction. In this paper, we develop a framework for autonomous self-trained CSI prediction for mmWave vehicular users where a base station (gNB) collects and labels a dataset that it uses for training recurrent neural network (RNN)-based CSI prediction model. The proposed framework exploits the CSI feedback from vehicular users combined with overhearing the C-V2X cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) they broadcast. We implement and evaluate the proposed framework using deepMIMO dataset generation environment and demonstrate its capability to provide accurate CSI prediction for 5G mmWave vehicular users. CSI prediction model is trained and its capability to provide accurate CSI predictions from various input features are investigated.</description>

      <title>TRIS-HAR: Transmissive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-assisted Cognitive Wireless Human Activity Recognition Using State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using radio frequency (RF) signals has garnered considerable attention for its applications in smart environments. However, traditional systems often struggle with limited independent channels between transmitters and receivers, multipath fading, and environmental noise, which particularly degrades performance in through-the-wall scenarios. In this paper, we present a transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS)-assisted through-the-wall human activity recognition (TRIS-HAR) system. The system employs TRIS technology to actively reshape wireless signal propagation, creating multiple independent paths to enhance signal clarity and improve recognition accuracy in complex indoor settings. Additionally, we propose the Human intelligence Mamba (HiMamba), an advanced state space model that captures temporal and frequency-based information for precise activity recognition. HiMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy. Extensive experiments indicate that the TRIS-HAR system improves recognition performance from 85.00% to 98.06% in laboratory conditions and maintains high performance across various environments. This approach offers a robust solution for enhancing RF-based HAR, with promising applications in smart home and elderly care systems.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Frequency-Bands Channel Characterization for In-vehicle Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-vehicle wireless networks are crucial for advancing smart transportation systems and enhancing interaction among vehicles and their occupants. However, there are limited studies in the current state of the art that investigate the in-vehicle channel characteristics in multiple frequency bands. In this paper, we present measurement campaigns conducted in a van and a car across below 7 GHz, millimeter-wave (mmWave), and sub-Terahertz (Sub-THz) bands. These campaigns aim to compare the channel characteristics for in-vehicle scenarios across various frequency bands. Channel impulse responses (CIRs) were measured at various locations distributed across the engine compartment of both the van and car. The CIR results reveal a high similarity in the delay properties between frequency bands below 7GHz and mmWave bands for the measurements in the engine bay. Sparse channels can be observed at Sub-THz bands in the engine bay scenarios. Channel spatial profiles in the passenger cabin of both the van and car are obtained by the directional scan sounding scheme for three bands. We compare the power angle delay profiles (PADPs) measured at different frequency bands in two line of sight (LOS) scenarios and one non-LOS (NLOS) scenario. Some major \added{multipath components (MPCs)} can be identified in all frequency bands and their trajectories are traced based on the geometry of the vehicles. The angular spread of arrival is also calculated for three scenarios. The analysis of channel characteristics in this paper can enhance our understanding of in-vehicle channels and foster the evolution of in-vehicle wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Automating the Design of Multi-band Microstrip Antennas via Uniform Cross-Entropy Optimizatio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating the design of microstrip antennas has been an active area of research for the past decade. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or, more recently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a number of work have demonstrated the possibility of producing non-trivial antenna geometries that can be efficient in terms of area utilization or be used in complex multi-frequency-band scenarios. However, both GAs and DNNs are notoriously compute-expensive, often requiring hour-long run times in order to produce new antenna geometries. In this paper, we propose to explore the novel use of Cross-Entropy optimization as a Monte-Carlo sampling technique for optimizing the geometry of patch antennas given a target $S_{11}$ scattering parameter curve that a user wants to obtain. We compare our proposed Uniform Cross-Entropy (UCE) method against other popular Monte-Carlo optimization techniques such as Gaussian Processes, Forest optimization and baseline random search approaches. We demonstrate that the proposed UCE technique outperforms the competing methods while still having a reasonable compute complexity, taking around 16 minutes to converge. Finally, our code is released as open-source with the hope of being useful to future research.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Diffusion Models for Resource-Constrained Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, generative semantic communication models have proliferated as they are revolutionizing semantic communication frameworks, improving their performance, and opening the way to novel applications. Despite their impressive ability to regenerate content from the compressed semantic information received, generative models pose crucial challenges for communication systems in terms of high memory footprints and heavy computational load. In this paper, we present a novel Quantized GEnerative Semantic COmmunication framework, Q-GESCO. The core method of Q-GESCO is a quantized semantic diffusion model capable of regenerating transmitted images from the received semantic maps while simultaneously reducing computational load and memory footprint thanks to the proposed post-training quantization technique. Q-GESCO is robust to different channel noises and obtains comparable performance to the full precision counterpart in different scenarios saving up to 75% memory and 79% floating point operations. This allows resource-constrained devices to exploit the generative capabilities of Q-GESCO, widening the range of applications and systems for generative semantic communication frameworks. The code is available at https://github.com/ispamm/Q-GESCO.</description>

      <title>Propagation Distance Estimation for Radio over Fiber with Cascaded Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) have opened great opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz (THz) communications. Noticing this great potential, this paper addresses the problem of estimation of the propagation distance of a sub-Thz signal along a radio over fiber structure. Particularly, this paper considers a novel cascaded structure that interconnects multiple radio units (RUs) via fiber for applications in indoor scenarios. Herein, we consider the cascaded effects of distortions introduced by non-linear power amplifiers at the RUs, and the propagation channel over the fiber is based on measurements obtained from transmissions of sub-THz signals on high-density polyethylene fibers. For the estimation of the propagation distance, non-linear least-squares algorithms are proposed, and our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimators present a good performance on the propagation distance estimation even in the presence of the cascaded effect of non-linear PAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operation is one of the open issues to be solved for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems to become a pillar of the future wireless infrastructure above 10 GHz. Existing NLOS countermeasures use either metallic mirrors, that are limited in coverage, or reconfigurable metasurfaces, that are limited in size due to cost. This paper focuses on integrated imaging and communication (IIAC) systems for NLOS exploration, where a base station (BS) serves the users while gathering a high-resolution image of the area. We exploit a large reflection plane, that is phase-configured in space and time jointly with a proper BS beam sweeping to provide a multi-view observation of the area and maximizing the image resolution. Remarkably, we achieve a near-field imaging through successive far-field acquisitions, limiting the design complexity and cost. Numerical results prove the benefits of our proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future communication systems are anticipated to facilitate applications requiring high data transmission rates while maintaining energy efficiency. Hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) offers this owing to its compact symbol arrangement within the two-dimensional (2D) plane. Building on the limitations of the current approaches, this letter presents a straightforward and precise approximation for calculating the symbol error probability (SEP) of HQAM in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The analytical and simulation results align across several signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In addition, the proposed approximation is effective for accurately estimating the SEP of HQAM in scenarios with slow-fading, including those subject to Rayleigh fading.</description>

      <title>Prediabetes detection in unconstrained conditions using wearable sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediabetes is a common health condition that often goes undetected until it progresses to type 2 diabetes. Early identification of prediabetes is essential for timely intervention and prevention of complications. This research explores the feasibility of using wearable continuous glucose monitoring along with smartwatches with embedded inertial sensors to collect glucose measurements and acceleration signals respectively, for the early detection of prediabetes. We propose a methodology based on signal processing and machine learning techniques. Two feature sets are extracted from the collected signals, based both on a dynamic modeling of the human glucose-homeostasis system and on the Glucose curve, inspired by three major glucose related blood tests. Features are aggregated per individual using bootstrap. Support Vector Machines are used to classify normoglycemic vs. prediabetic individuals. We collected data from 22 participants for evaluation. The results are highly encouraging, demonstrating high sensitivity and precision. This work is a proof of concept, highlighting the potential of wearable devices in prediabetes assessment. Future directions involve expanding the study to a larger, more diverse population and exploring the integration of CGM and smartwatch functionalities into a unified device. Automated eating detecting algorithms can also be used.</description>

      <title>Secure Backscatter Communications Through RIS: Modeling and Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscatter communication (BC) has emerged as a pivotal wireless communication paradigm owing to its low-power and cost-effective characteristics. However, BC faces various challenges from its low signal detection rate to its security vulnerabilities. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have surfaced as a transformative technology addressing power and communication performance issues in BC. However, the potential of RIS in addressing the security challenges of BC remains uncharted. This paper investigates the secrecy performance of RIS-aided BC, where all channels are distributed according to the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ distribution. Specifically, we consider a RIS with $N$ reflecting elements to help a backscatter device (BD) establish a smart environment and enhance the secrecy performance in BC. Due to the nature of BC systems, our analysis considers two possible scenarios (i) in the absence of direct links and (ii) in the presence of direct links. In both cases, we first derive compact analytical expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at both a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper. Then, to analyze the secrecy performance, we further derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both mentioned scenarios. In addition, regarding the importance of system behavior in a high SNR regime, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the SOP and ASC. Eventually, the Monte-Carlo simulation is used to validate the analytical results, revealing that utilizing RIS can greatly improve the secrecy performance of the BC system relative to traditional BC setups that do not incorporate RIS.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Collaborative Inertial Tracking</title>

Abstract: Although people spend most of their time indoors, outdoor tracking systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), are predominantly used for location-based services. These systems are accurate outdoors, easy to use, and operate autonomously on each mobile device. In contrast, Indoor Tracking Systems~(ITS) lack standardization and are often difficult to operate because they require costly infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an indoor tracking algorithm that uses collected data from inertial sensors embedded in most mobile devices. In this setting, mobile devices autonomously estimate their location, hence removing the burden of deploying and maintaining complex and scattered hardware infrastructure. In addition, these devices collaborate by anonymously exchanging data with other nearby devices, using wireless communication, such as Bluetooth, to correct errors in their location estimates. Our collaborative algorithm relies on low-complexity geometry operations and can be deployed on any recent mobile device with commercial-grade sensors. We evaluate our solution on real-life data collected by different devices. Experimentation with 16 simultaneously moving and collaborating devices shows an average accuracy improvement of 44% compared to the standalone Pedestrian Dead Reckoning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Source-Free Time-Series Adaptation via Parameter Subspace Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of time-series, focusing on enhancing both parameter efficiency and data-sample utilization. Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</description>

      <title>Capturing complex hand movements and object interactions using machine learning-powered stretchable smart textile gloves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate real-time tracking of dexterous hand movements and interactions has numerous applications in human-computer interaction, metaverse, robotics, and tele-health. Capturing realistic hand movements is challenging because of the large number of articulations and degrees of freedom. Here, we report accurate and dynamic tracking of articulated hand and finger movements using stretchable, washable smart gloves with embedded helical sensor yarns and inertial measurement units. The sensor yarns have a high dynamic range, responding to low 0.005 % to high 155 % strains, and show stability during extensive use and washing cycles. We use multi-stage machine learning to report average joint angle estimation root mean square errors of 1.21 and 1.45 degrees for intra- and inter-subjects cross-validation, respectively, matching accuracy of costly motion capture cameras without occlusion or field of view limitations. We report a data augmentation technique that enhances robustness to noise and variations of sensors. We demonstrate accurate tracking of dexterous hand movements during object interactions, opening new avenues of applications including accurate typing on a mock paper keyboard, recognition of complex dynamic and static gestures adapted from American Sign Language and object identification.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time constructive decision algorithm for multivariable quantum signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) have provided a unified framework for understanding many quantum algorithms, including factorization, matrix inversion, and Hamiltonian simulation. As a multivariable version of QSP, multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP) is proposed. M-QSP interleaves signal operators corresponding to each variable with signal processing operators, which provides an efficient means to perform multivariable polynomial transformations. However, the necessary and sufficient condition for what types of polynomials can be constructed by M-QSP is unknown. In this paper, we propose a classical algorithm to determine whether a given pair of multivariable Laurent polynomials can be implemented by M-QSP, which returns True or False. As one of the most important properties of this algorithm, it returning True is the necessary and sufficient condition. The proposed classical algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of variables and signal operators. Our algorithm also provides a constructive method to select the necessary parameters for implementing M-QSP. These findings offer valuable insights for identifying practical applications of M-QSP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems play a crucial role in fifth-generation (5G) mobile communications, primarily achieved through the utilization of precoding matrix techniques. This paper presents precoding techniques employing codebooks in downlink MIMO-5G wireless communications, aiming to enhance network performance to meet the overarching 5G objectives of increased capacity and reduced latency. We conduct a comparative analysis of various precoding techniques outlined by the 5G standard through diverse simulations across different scenarios. These simulations enable us to assess the performance of the different precoding techniques, ultimately revealing the strengths and weaknesses inherent in Type I and Type II codebooks.</description>

      <title>Temporal Predictive Coding for Gradient Compression in Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a prediction-based gradient compression method for distributed learning with event-triggered communication. Our goal is to reduce the amount of information transmitted from the distributed agents to the parameter server by exploiting temporal correlation in the local gradients. We use a linear predictor that \textit{combines past gradients to form a prediction of the current gradient}, with coefficients that are optimized by solving a least-square problem. In each iteration, every agent transmits the predictor coefficients to the server such that the predicted local gradient can be computed. The difference between the true local gradient and the predicted one, termed the \textit{prediction residual, is only transmitted when its norm is above some threshold.} When this additional communication step is omitted, the server uses the prediction as the estimated gradient. This proposed design shows notable performance gains compared to existing methods in the literature, achieving convergence with reduced communication costs.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices. A recent study has proved that, with Haar random projective measurements, only a $O(n^3)$ number of state copies is required to guarantee bounded recovery error of an matrix product operator (MPO) state of qubits $n$. While this result provides a formal evidence that quantum states with an efficient classical representation can be reconstructed with an efficient number of state copies, the number of state copies required is still significantly larger than the number of independent parameters in the classical representation.
  In this paper, we attempt to narrow this gap and study whether the number of state copies can saturate the information theoretic bound (i.e., $O(n)$, the number of parameters in the MPOs) using physical quantum measurements. We answer this question affirmatively by using a class of Informationally Complete Positive Operator-Valued Measures (IC-POVMs), including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\ge3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is needed for a guaranteed recovery of any state represented by an MPO. Moreover, we propose a projected gradient descent (PGD) algorithm to solve the constrained least-squares problem and show that it can efficiently find an estimate with bounded recovery error when appropriately initialized.</description>

      <title>Data Similarity-Based One-Shot Clustering for Multi-Task Hierarchical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a hierarchical federated learning setting in which users work toward learning different tasks. To overcome the challenge of task heterogeneity, users need to be grouped in a way such that users with the same task are in the same group, conducting training together, while sharing the weights of feature extraction layers with the other groups. Toward that end, we propose a one-shot clustering algorithm that can effectively identify and group users based on their data similarity. This enables more efficient collaboration and sharing of a common layer representation within the federated learning system. Our proposed algorithm not only enhances the clustering process, but also overcomes challenges related to privacy concerns, communication overhead, and the need for prior knowledge about learning models or loss function behaviors. We validate our proposed algorithm using various datasets such as CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST, and show that it outperforms the baseline in terms of accuracy and variance reduction.</description>

Abstract: Multiple-antenna technologies are evolving towards larger aperture sizes, extremely high frequencies, and innovative antenna types. This evolution is fostering the emergence of near-field communications (NFC) in future wireless systems. Considerable attention has been directed towards this cutting-edge technology due to its potential to enhance the capacity of wireless networks by introducing increased spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the range domain. Within this context, a comprehensive review of the state of the art on NFC is presented, with a specific focus on its 1) fundamental operating principles, 2) channel modeling, 3) performance analysis, 4) signal processing techniques, and 5) integration with other emerging applications. Specifically, 1) the basic principles of NFC are characterized from both physics and communications perspectives, unveiling its unique properties in contrast to far-field communications. 2) Building on these principles, deterministic and stochastic near-field channel models are explored for spatially-discrete (SPD) and continuous-aperture (CAP) arrays. 3) Based on these models, existing contributions to near-field performance analysis are reviewed in terms of DoFs/effective DoFs (EDoFs), the power scaling law, and transmission rate. 4) Existing signal processing techniques for NFC are systematically surveyed, which include channel estimation, beamforming design, and low-complexity beam training. 5) Major issues and research opportunities in incorporating near-field models into other promising technologies are identified to advance NFC's deployment in next-generation networks. Throughout this paper, promising directions are highlighted to inspire future research endeavors in the realm of NFC, underscoring its significance in the advancement of wireless communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Intelligent fault diagnosis of worm gearbox based on adaptive CNN using amended gorilla troop optimization with quantum gate mutation strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The worm gearbox is a high-speed transmission system that plays a vital role in various industries. Therefore it becomes necessary to develop a robust fault diagnosis scheme for worm gearbox. Due to advancements in sensor technology, researchers from academia and industries prefer deep learning models for fault diagnosis purposes. The optimal selection of hyperparameters (HPs) of deep learning models plays a significant role in stable performance. Existing methods mainly focused on manual tunning of these parameters, which is a troublesome process and sometimes leads to inaccurate results. Thus, exploring more sophisticated methods to optimize the HPs automatically is important. In this work, a novel optimization, i.e. amended gorilla troop optimization (AGTO), has been proposed to make the convolutional neural network (CNN) adaptive for extracting the features to identify the worm gearbox defects. Initially, the vibration and acoustic signals are converted into 2D images by the Morlet wavelet function. Then, the initial model of CNN is developed by setting hyperparameters. Further, the search space of each Hp is identified and optimized by the developed AGTO algorithm. The classification accuracy has been evaluated by AGTO-CNN, which is further validated by the confusion matrix. The performance of the developed model has also been compared with other models. The AGTO algorithm is examined on twenty-three classical benchmark functions and the Wilcoxon test which demonstrates the effectiveness and dominance of the developed optimization algorithm. The results obtained suggested that the AGTO-CNN has the highest diagnostic accuracy and is stable and robust while diagnosing the worm gearbox.</description>

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the partially-connected hybrid analog and digital (PC-HAD) structure has been widely used in the far-field (FF) scenario for it can significantly reduce the hardware cost and complexity of large-scale or extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) array. Recently, near-field (NF) emitter localization including direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range estimations has drawn a lot of attention, but is rarely explored via PC-HAD structure. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of PC-HAD structure on the NF emitter localization and observe that the phase ambiguity (PA) problem caused by PC-HAD structure can be removed inherently with low-latency in the NF scenario. To obtain the exact NF DOA estimation results, we propose a grouped PC-HAD structure, which is capable of dividing the NF DOA estimation problem into multiple FF DOA estimation problems via partitioning the large-scale PC-HAD array into small-scale groups. An angle calibration method is developed to address the inconsistency among these FF DOA estimation problems. Then, to eliminate PA and improve the NF emitter localization performance, we develop three machine learning (ML)-based methods, i.e., two low-complexity data-driven clustering-based methods and one model-driven regression method, namely RegNet. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of NF emitter localization for the proposed grouped PC-HAD structure is derived and reveals that localization performance will decrease with the increasing of the number of groups. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can achieve CRLB at different SNR regions, the RegNet has great performance advantages at low SNR regions and the clustering-based methods have much lower computation complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wearable smart systems, continuous monitoring and accurate classification of different sleep-related conditions are critical for enhancing sleep quality and preventing sleep-related chronic conditions. However, the requirements for device-skin coupling quality in electrophysiological sleep monitoring systems hinder the comfort and reliability of night wearing. Here, we report a washable, skin-compatible smart garment sleep monitoring system that captures local skin strain signals under weak device-skin coupling conditions without positioning or skin preparation requirements. A printed textile-based strain sensor array responds to strain from 0.1% to 10% with a gauge factor as high as 100 and shows independence to extrinsic motion artefacts via strain-isolating printed pattern design. Through reversible starching treatment, ink penetration depth during direct printing on garments is controlled to achieve batch-to-batch performance variation &lt; 10%. Coupled with deep learning, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and transfer learning data processing, the smart garment is capable of classifying six sleep states with an accuracy of 98.6%, maintaining excellent explainability (classification with low bias) and generalization (95% accuracy on new users with few-shot learning less than 15 samples per class) in practical applications, paving the way for next-generation daily sleep healthcare management.</description>

      <title>WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Relative Pose Estimation and IMU Preintegration Using Passive UWB Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) systems are becoming increasingly popular as a means of inter-robot ranging and communication. A major constraint associated with UWB is that only one pair of UWB transceivers can range at a time to avoid interference, hence hindering the scalability of UWB-based localization. In this paper, a ranging protocol is proposed that allows all robots to passively listen on neighbouring communicating robots without any hierarchical restrictions on the role of the robots. This is utilized to allow each robot to obtain more range measurements and to broadcast preintegrated inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements for relative extended pose state estimation directly on SE2(3). Consequently, a simultaneous clock-synchronization and relative-pose estimator (CSRPE) is formulated using an on-manifold extended Kalman filter (EKF) and is evaluated in simulation using Monte-Carlo runs for up to 7 robots. The ranging protocol is implemented in C on custom-made UWB boards fitted to 3 quadcopters, and the proposed filter is evaluated over multiple experimental trials, yielding up to 48% improvement in localization accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Projections for Discriminative Dictionary Learning using the JL-lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction-based dictionary learning methods in the literature have often used iterative random projections. The dimensionality of such a random projection matrix is a random number that might not lead to a separable subspace structure in the transformed space. The convergence of such methods highly depends on the initial seed values used. Also, gradient descent-based updates might result in local minima. This paper proposes a constructive approach to derandomize the projection matrix using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. Rather than reducing dimensionality via random projections, a projection matrix derived from the proposed Modified Supervised PC analysis is used. A heuristic is proposed to decide the data perturbation levels and the dictionary atom's corresponding suitable description length. The projection matrix is derived in a single step, provides maximum feature-label consistency of the transformed space, and preserves the geometry of the original data. The projection matrix thus constructed is proved to be a JL-embedding. Despite confusing classes in the OCR datasets, the dictionary trained in the transformed space generates discriminative sparse coefficients with reduced complexity. Empirical study demonstrates that the proposed method performs well even when the number of classes and dimensionality increase. Experimentation on OCR and face recognition datasets shows better classification performance than other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Masked Autoencoder and Comprehensive Evaluations for Reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from Arbitrary Single-Lead ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) has emerged as a widely accepted diagnostic instrument for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The standard clinical 12-lead ECG configuration causes considerable inconvenience and discomfort, while wearable devices offers a more practical alternative. To reduce information gap between 12-lead ECG and single-lead ECG, this study proposes a multi-channel masked autoencoder (MCMA) for reconstructing 12-Lead ECG from arbitrary single-lead ECG, and a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, ECGGenEval, encompass the signal-level, feature-level, and diagnostic-level evaluations. MCMA can achieve the state-of-the-art performance. In the signal-level evaluation, the mean square errors of 0.0317 and 0.1034, Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.7885 and 0.7420. In the feature-level evaluation, the average standard deviation of the mean heart rate across the generated 12-lead ECG is 1.0481, the coefficient of variation is 1.58%, and the range is 3.2874. In the diagnostic-level evaluation, the average F1-score with two generated 12-lead ECG from different single-lead ECG are 0.8233 and 0.8410.</description>

      <title>Neural Fields for Adaptive Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality with wide medical applications. Conventional PACT image reconstruction algorithms suffer from wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue, which leads to image degradation. Accounting for these effects improves image quality, but measuring the SOS distribution is experimentally expensive. An alternative approach is to perform joint reconstruction of the initial pressure image and SOS using only the PA signals. Existing joint reconstruction methods come with limitations: high computational cost, inability to directly recover SOS, and reliance on inaccurate simplifying assumptions. Implicit neural representation, or neural fields, is an emerging technique in computer vision to learn an efficient and continuous representation of physical fields with a coordinate-based neural network. In this work, we introduce NF-APACT, an efficient self-supervised framework utilizing neural fields to estimate the SOS in service of an accurate and robust multi-channel deconvolution. Our method removes SOS aberrations an order of magnitude faster and more accurately than existing methods. We demonstrate the success of our method on a novel numerical phantom as well as an experimentally collected phantom and in vivo data. Our code and numerical phantom are available at https://github.com/Lukeli0425/NF-APACT.</description>
