      <title>Quantitative cancer-immunity cycle modeling to optimize bevacizumab and atezolizumab combination therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incidence of advanced renal cell carcinoma(RCC) has been rising, presenting significant challenges due to the limited efficacy and severe side effects of traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. While combination immunotherapies show promise, optimizing treatment strategies remains difficult due to individual heterogeneity. To address this, we developed a Quantitative Cancer-Immunity Cycle (QCIC) model that integrates ordinary differential equations with stochastic modelling to quantitatively characterize and predict tumor evolution in patients with advanced RCC. By systematically integrating quantitative systems pharmacology principles with biological mechanistic knowledge, we constructed a virtual patient cohort and calibrated the model parameters using clinical immunohistochemistry data to ensure biological validity. To enhance predictive performance, we coupled the model with pharmacokinetic equations and defined the Tumor Response Index (TRI) as a quantitative metric of efficacy. Systematic analysis of the QCIC model allowed us to determine an optimal treatment regimen for the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab and identify tumor biomarkers with clinical predictive value. This study provides a theoretical framework and methodological support for precision medicine in the treatment of advanced RCC.</description>

      <title>Physiology-Informed Generative Multi-Task Network for Contrast-Free CT Perfusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment. While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall, MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.</description>
