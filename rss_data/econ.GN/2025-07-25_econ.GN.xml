      <title>Rethinking Indonesia's Public Debt in the Era of Negative Interest Rate-Growth Differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study contributes to the discussion about how higher public debt may not be costly because of the negative interest rate-growth differentials by simulating OLG models introduced by Blanchard (2019) under uncertainty, showing debt and welfare dynamics in two scenarios: intergenerational transfers and debt rollovers in the case of Indonesia. The simulation is done by modifying the model parameters based on interest rate-growth differentials historic data from 2004-2019. It is found that the fiscal consensus does not hold when implementing Blanchard (2019) analysis with Indonesian-based rate parameters. Increasing public debt makes the economy more volatile and high risk. Modifying other factors supports the initial finding, with lower initial endowment diminishing the benefits of public debt and higher capital share under Cobb-Douglas. When the threat of debt explosion appears, efforts to reduce debt share will reduce the welfare of the society. The policy implication is to be careful of the opportunity. Increasing public debt may not be the way to go, avoiding possible dire consequences.</description>

      <title>Beyond Patents: R&amp;D, Capital, and the Productivity Puzzle in Early-Stage High-Tech Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between innovation activities and firm-level productivity among early-stage high-tech startups in China. Using a proprietary dataset encompassing patent records, R&amp;D expenditures, capital valuation, and firm performance from 2020 to 2024, we examine whether and how innovation, measured by patents and R&amp;D input, translates into economic output. Contrary to established literature, we find that patent output does not significantly contribute to either income or profit among the sampled firms. Further investigation reveals that patents may primarily serve a signaling function to external investors and policymakers, rather than reflecting true innovative productivity. In contrast, R&amp;D expenditure shows a consistent and positive association with firm performance. Through mechanism analysis, we explore three channels (organizational environment, employee quality, and policy-driven incentives) to explain the impact of R&amp;D, identifying capital inflow and valuation as key drivers of R&amp;D investment. Finally, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effects of R&amp;D are more pronounced in sub-industries such as smart terminals and digital creativity, and for firms based in Shenzhen. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that patent output is a universal indicator of innovation success and underscore the context-dependent nature of innovation-performance linkages in emerging markets.</description>

      <title>From Individual Learning to Market Equilibrium: Correcting Structural and Parametric Biases in RL Simulations of Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.</description>

      <title>Becoming Green: Decomposing the Macroeconomic Effects of Green Technology News Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the macroeconomic effects of news about future technological advancements in the green sector. Utilizing the economic value of green patents granted to publicly listed companies in the U.S., we identify green technology news shocks via a convenient and meaningful rotation of the innovations from a Bayesian Vector Autorregresion Model (BVAR). These shocks are decomposed into two orthogonal components: i) a common technological component shared by both green and non-green innovation, that reproduces response patterns similar to those expected from a technology news shock with long-run impacts on productivity; and ii) an idiosyncratic component to green innovation inducing inflationary pressures and stock price reductions. The responses to the idiosyncratic component suggest the existence of a green transition news mechanism related to expectations of more rigorous carbon policies or stricter environmental standards in the future. The focus on green innovation deepens our understanding about the effect of technology-specific news shocks and provides information of practical importance for macroeconomic and environmental policies.</description>

      <title>Go Green Without the Mafia! Dissolution of Infiltrated City Councils and Environmental Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of organized crime infiltration in city councils on environmental policies implemented in Italy at the municipal level. To this purpose, we exploit the exogenous shock of the removal of a city council infiltrated by the mafia and its substitution with an external Commission, allowed in Italy by the law 164/1991. Our results suggest that after dissolution, environmental policies improve in several dimensions: the capital expenditure for sustainable development and the environment increases; the current expenditure on integrated water system increases; the percentage of sorted waste increases because, as we show, public expenditure is reallocated toward sorted waste at the expenses of unsorted waste. These results are robust to different specifications of the control group. In addition, we find significant spillover effects: the dissolution of infiltrated city councils implies an improvement in environmental policies in adjacent municipalities. Our results have a straightforward policy implication, the need to combat organized crime as a way to improve the environmental conditions of the territories plagued by its pervasive presence.</description>

      <title>Explainable Graph Neural Networks via Structural Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework, GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures , significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Investors' Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate investors' voluntary disclosure decisions under uncertainty about their information endowment (Dye 1985). In our model, an investor may receive initial evidence about a target firm. Conditional on learning the initial evidence, the investor may receive additional evidence that helps interpret the initial evidence. The investor takes a position in the firm's stock, then voluntarily discloses some or all of their findings, and finally closes their position after the disclosure. We present two main findings. First, the investor will always disclose the initial evidence, even though the market is uncertain about whether the investor possesses such evidence. Second, the investor's disclosure strategy of the additional evidence increases stock price volatility: they disclose extreme news and withhold moderate news. Due to the withholding of the additional evidence, misleading disclosure arises as an equilibrium outcome, where the investor's report decreases (increases) price despite their news being good (bad). These results remain robust when considering the target firm's endogenous response to the investor's report.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic complexity methods aim to estimate the combined presence of economic factors without having to explicitly define them. A key method in this literature is the Economic Complexity Index or ECI, an eigenvector derived from specialization matrices that explains variation in economic growth, inequality, and sustainability. Yet, despite the widespread use of ECI in economic development, economic geography, and innovation studies, we still lack a principled theory that can deduce it from a mechanistic model. Here, we calculate $ECI$ analytically for a model where the output of an economy in an activity increases if the economy is more likely to be endowed with the factors required by the activity. We derive ECI analytically and numerically and show that it is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is endowed with many factors, validating the idea that ECI is an agnostic estimate of the presence of multiple factors in an economy. We then generalize this result to other production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with prices, wages, and consumption, finding that the derived wage function is consistent with economies converging to an income that is compatible with their complexity. Finally, we show this model explains differences in the shapes of networks of related activities, such as the product space and the research space. These findings solve long standing puzzles in the literature and validate metrics of economic complexity as estimates of the combined presence of multiple factors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Optimization for European Electricity System Planning Considering Regional Dunkelflaute Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study develops a capacity expansion model for a fully decarbonized European electricity system using an Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO) framework. The model endogenously identifies the worst regional Dunkelflaute events, prolonged periods of low wind and solar availability, and incorporates multiple extreme weather realizations within a single optimization run. Results show that system costs rise nonlinearly with the geographic extent of these events: a single worst-case regional disruption increases costs by 9%, but broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to much sharper increases, up to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across most of Europe, additional cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of 71%. The optimal technology mix evolves with the severity of weather stress: while renewables, batteries, and interregional transmission are sufficient to manage localized events, large-scale disruptions require long-term hydrogen storage and load shedding to maintain system resilience. Central European regions, especially Germany and France, emerge as systemic bottlenecks, while peripheral regions bear the cost of compensatory overbuilding. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated European policy strategy that goes beyond national planning to support cross-border infrastructure investment, scale up flexible technologies such as long-duration storage, and promote a geographically balanced deployment of renewables to mitigate systemic risks associated with Dunkelflaute events.</description>

      <title>Normalizations and misspecification in skill formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important class of structural models studies the determinants of skill formation and the optimal timing of interventions. In this paper, I provide new identification results for these models and investigate the effects of seemingly innocuous scale and location restrictions on parameters of interest. To do so, I first characterize the identified set of all parameters without these additional restrictions and show that important policy-relevant parameters are point identified under weaker assumptions than commonly used in the literature. The implications of imposing standard scale and location restrictions depend on how the model is specified, but they generally impact the interpretation of parameters and may affect counterfactuals. Importantly, with the popular CES production function, commonly used scale restrictions fix identified parameters and lead to misspecification. Consequently, simply changing the units of measurements of observed variables might yield ineffective investment strategies and misleading policy recommendations. I show how existing estimators can easily be adapted to solve these issues. As a byproduct, this paper also presents a general and formal definition of when restrictions are truly normalizations.</description>
