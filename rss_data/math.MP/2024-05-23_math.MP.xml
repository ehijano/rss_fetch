      <title>Traveling Wave Solutions For Newton's Equations of Celestial Mechanics: Kepler's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article produces wave equations and constructs traveling wave solutions that are intimately related to Newton's equations of celestial mechanics. The traveling wave solutions are expressed in ``closed form'' in terms of elementary functions. They are specialized to the 2-body and the relative 2-body problem. The traveling wave solutions disclose the shape and position of wave fronts emanating from collisions by determining the location of the singularities of the traveling wave solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced area law in the Widom-Sobolev formula for the free Dirac operator in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a logarithmically enhanced area law for all R\'enyi entanglement entropies of the ground state of a free gas of relativistic Dirac fermions. Such asymptotics occur in any dimension if the modulus of the Fermi energy is larger than the mass of the particles and in the massless case at Fermi energy zero in one space dimension. In all other cases of mass, Fermi energy and dimension, the entanglement entropy grows no faster than the area of the involved spatial region. The result is established for a general class of test functions which includes the ones corresponding to R\'enyi entropies and relies on a recently proved extension of the Widom-Sobolev formula to matrix-valued symbols by the authors.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for general nonholonomic systems from the d'Alembert principle via an algebraic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to present an alternative way to deduce the equations of motion of general (i.e., also nonlinear) nonholonomic constrained systems starting from the d'Alembert principle and proceeding by an algebraic procedure. The two classical approaches in nonholonomic mechanics -- Cetaev method and vakonomic method -- are treated on equal terms, avoiding integrations or other steps outside algebraic operations. In the second part of the work we compare our results with the standard forms of the equations of motion associated to the two method and we discuss the role of the transpositional relation and of the commutation rule within the question of equivalence and compatibility of the Cetaev and vakonomic methods for general nonholonomic systems.</description>

      <title>'Just another field theory' approach to $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills and the origin of intrinsic SuperGeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-geometric derivation of $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills by focusing on the consistency of interactions that extend the free vector supermultiplet rather than assuming gauge invariance under extended symmetries. By utilizing a superspace first-order description, the theory is given in closed form as a third-order polynomial which includes a single cubic interaction term instead of an infinite series, thus eliminating the need for a special gauge. The geometrical interpretation of the theory emerges, as opposed to being presupposed.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Norm-squared of the momentum map in infinite dimensions with applications to K\"ahler geometry and symplectic connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the norm-squared of the momentum map as a rigorous tool in infinite dimensions. In particular, we calculate the Hessian at a critical point, show that it is positive semi-definite along the complexified orbit, and determine a decomposition of the stabilizer under the complexified action. We apply these results to the action of the group of symplectomorphisms on the spaces of compatible almost complex structures and of symplectic connections. In the former case, we extend results of Calabi to not necessarily integrable almost complex structures that are extremal in a relative sense. In both cases, the momentum map is not equivariant, which gives rise to new phenomena and opens up new avenues for interesting applications. For example, using the prequantization construction, we obtain new central extensions of the group of symplectomorphisms that are encoding geometric information of the underlying finite-dimensional manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a proof of 5D $A_n$ AGT conjecture at $\beta=1$, where the gauge theory side is one dimension higher than the original 4D case, and corresponds to the q-deformation of the 2D conformal field theory side. We define a q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg integral, which generalizes the $A_n$ Selberg integral and the q-deformed $A_1$ Selberg integral in the literature. A q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg average formula with $n+1$ Schur polynomials is proposed to complete the proof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider active nematodynamics on deformable surfaces. Based on a thermodynamically consistent surface Beris-Edwards model we add nematic activity and focus on the emerging additional coupling mechanism between the nematic field, the flow field and the curved surface. We analyse the impact of the active nematic force at topological defects. Under the presence of curvature all defects become active and contribute not only tangential forces but also normal forces. This confirms the proposed role of topological defects in surface evolution and provides the basis for a dynamic description of morphogenetic processes.</description>

      <title>One loop effective actions in Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the confidence region in orbit determination for hyperbolic maps with a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dealing with an orbit determination problem, uncertainties naturally arise from intrinsic errors related to observation devices and approximation models. Following the least squares method and applying approximation schemes such as the differential correction, uncertainties can be geometrically summarized in confidence regions and estimated by confidence ellipsoids. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the confidence ellipsoids while the number of observations and the time span over which they are performed simultaneously increase. Numerical evidences suggest that, in the chaotic scenario, the uncertainties decay at different rates whether the orbit determination is set up to recover the initial conditions alone or along with a dynamical or kinematical parameter, while in the regular case there is no distinction. We show how to improve some of the results in \cite{maro.bonanno}, providing conditions that imply a non-faster-than-polynomial rate of decay in the chaotic case with the parameter, in accordance with the numerical experiments. We also apply these findings to well known examples of chaotic maps, such as piecewise expanding maps of the unit interval or affine hyperbolic toral transformations. We also discuss the applicability to intermittent maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a theory defined by an energy-momentum tensor depending on a set of general fields, including the space-time metric. We prove that if the theory is causal, bounded and transforms appropriately under diffeomorphism, it will depend only on the local values of the independent fields and their covariant derivatives up to a finite order. The implications are that the energy-momentum tensor of a causal relativistic fluid can only depend on covariant derivatives only up to a finite order.</description>

      <title>Form factors, spectral and K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation in nonlocal quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the conical region of convergence of exponential and asymptotically polynomial form factors and their integral representation as the sum of complex conjugate pairs corresponding to virtual particles that never go on-shell. Then, we calculate the spectral representation of the propagator of nonlocal theories with entire form factors, in particular, of the above type. The spectral density is positive definite and exhibits the same spectrum as the local theory. We also find that the piece of the propagator corresponding to the time-ordered two-point correlation function admits a generalization of the K\"all\'en--Lehmann representation with a standard momentum dependence and a spectral density differing from the local one only in the presence of interactions. These results are in agreement with what already known about the free theory after a field redefinition and about perturbative unitarity of the interacting theory.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom in modified Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss the issue of degrees of freedom in modified teleparallel gravity. These theories do have an extra structure on top of the usual (pseudo)Riemannian manifold, that of a flat parallel transport. This structure is absolutely abstract and unpredictable (pure gauge) in GR-equivalent models, however it becomes physical upon modifications. The problem is that, in the most popular models, this local symmetry is broken but not stably so, hence the infamous strong coupling issues. The Hamiltonian analyses become complicated and with contradictory results. A funny point is that what we see in available linear perturbation treatments of $f(T)$ gravity is much closer to the analysis with less dynamical degrees of freedom which has got a well-known mistake in it, while the more accurate work predicts much more of dynamics than what has ever been seen up to now. I discuss possible reasons behind this puzzle, and also argue in favour of studying the most general New GR models which are commonly ignored due to suspicion of ghosts.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results, but the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we advocate an alternative view-point that sheds light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V.\;Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model enables a deep connection between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representation theory of Lie algebras as pursued in quantum theory. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. The transferal of outcomes, from finite-dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional fluids, is then supported by hard-fought results in quantization theory -- the field which describes the limit between quantum and classical physics. We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that turning on the interaction of relativistic spinless particles with the vacuum of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) leads to the replacement of the Klein-Gordon equation with the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation. In this case, coordinate time becomes an operator and free relativistic particles go into a virtual state. We discuss geometry associated with classical and quantum Klein-Gordon oscillators, and its relation to the geometry underlying the description of free particles.</description>

      <title>On resonant energy sets for Hamiltonian systems with reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two uncoupled oscillators, horizontal and vertical, residing in rectilinear polygons (with only vertical and horizontal sides) and impacting elastically from their boundary. The main purpose of the article is to analyze the occurrence of resonance in such systems, depending on the shape of the analytical potentials that determine the oscillators. We define resonant energy levels; roughly speaking, these are levels for which the resonance phenomenon occurs more often than rarely. We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. We also indicate which classes of potentials each of the three possibilities can occur in. From this point of view, the last case (strongly resonant) is the most interesting. Then, the potentials belong to a special class of potentials, denoted by $\mathcal{SP}$, which seems unknown in the literature. The presented results appear to be new, even in the simplest case, when the uncoupled oscillators are not trapped in any set.</description>

      <title>Theory of Generalized Landau Levels and Implication for non-Abelian States</title>

Abstract: Quantum geometry is a fundamental concept to characterize the local properties of quantum states. It is recently demonstrated that saturating certain quantum geometric bounds allows a topological Chern band to share many essential features with the lowest Landau level, facilitating fractionalized phases in moir\'e flat bands. In this work, we systematically extend the consequence and universality of saturated geometric bounds to arbitrary Landau levels by introducing a set of single-particle states, which we term as ``generalized Landau levels''. These generalized Landau levels exhibit exactly quantized values of integrated trace of quantum metric determined by their corresponding Landau level indices, regardless of the nonuniformity of their quantum geometric quantities. We derive all geometric quantities for individual and multiple generalized Landau levels, discuss their relations, and understand them in light of the theory of holomorphic curves and moving frames. We further propose a model by superposing few generalized Landau levels which is supposed to capture a large portion of the single-particle Hilbert space of a generic Chern band analogous to the first Landau level. Using this model, we employ exact diagonalization to identify a single-particle geometric criterion for permitting the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase, which is potentially useful for future engineering of moir\'e materials and beyond. We use a double twisted bilayer graphene model with only adjacent layer hopping term to show the existence of first generalized Landau level type narrow band and zero-field Moore-Read state at the second magic angle which serves as a promising starting point for more detailed future studies. We expect that generalized Landau levels will serve as a systematic tool for analyzing topological Chern bands and fractionalized phases therein.</description>

      <title>Quantized geodesic lengths for Teichm\"uller spaces: algebraic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1980's H Verlinde suggested to construct and use a quantization of Teichm\"uller spaces to construct spaces of conformal blocks for the Liouville conformal field theory. This suggestion led to a mathematical formulation by Fock in 1990's, called the modular functor conjecture, based on the Chekhov-Fock quantum Teichm\"uller theory. In 2000's Teschner combined the Chekhov-Fock version and the Kashaev version of quantum Teichm\"uller theory to construct a solution to a modified form of the conjecture. We embark on a direct approach to the conjecture based on the Chekhov-Fock(-Goncharov) theory. We construct quantized trace-of-monodromy along simple loops via Bonahon and Wong's quantum trace maps developed in 2010's, and investigate algebraic structures of them, which will eventually lead to construction and properties of quantized geodesic length operators. We show that a special recursion relation used by Teschner is satisfied by the quantized trace-of-monodromy, and that the quantized trace-of-monodromy for disjoint loops commute in a certain strong sense.</description>

      <title>Einstein manifolds with optical geometries of Kerr type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the Ricci flat Lorentzian $n$-manifolds satisfying three particular conditions, encoding and combining some crucial features of the Kerr metrics and the Robinson-Trautman optical structures. We prove that if $n &gt; 4$, there is no Lorentzian manifold satisfying the considered conditions, while for $n = 4$ there are two large classes of such manifolds. Each class consists of manifolds fibering over open Riemann surfaces, equipped with a metric of constant Gaussian curvature $\kappa = 1$ or $\kappa = -1$. The first class properly includes a three parameter family of metrics admitting real analytic extensions to $(\mathbb R^3 \setminus\{0\}) \times \mathbb R = (S^2 \times \mathbb R_+) \times \mathbb R$ (all others develop singularities) and all such extensions are isometric to the well-known Kerr metrics. The three parameters correspond to the three space-like components of the angular momentum of the gravitational field. The second class contains a subclass of metrics defined on $\big(\mathbb D\times \mathbb R_+\big)\times \mathbb R$, where $\mathbb D$ is the Lobachevsky Poincar\'e disc. This subclass is in bijection with the holomorphic functions on $\mathbb D$ satisfying an appropriate open condition. These and other results are obtained as consequences of a very simple method of generating a number of explicit examples of Ricci flat Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

      <title>The inverse spectral problem for quantum semitoric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.06704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a quantum semitoric system composed of pseudodifferential  operators, Berezin-Toeplitz operators, or a combination of both, we  obtain explicit formulas for recovering, from the semiclassical  asymptotics of the joint spectrum, all symplectic invariants of the  underlying classical semitoric system.  Our formulas are based on the possibility to obtain good quantum  numbers for joint eigenvalues from the bare data of the joint  spectrum. In the spectral region corresponding to regular values of  the momentum map, the algorithms developed by Dauge, Hall and the  second author [27] produce such  labellings. In our proof, it was crucial to extend these algorithms  to the boundary of the spectrum, which led to the new notion of  asymptotic half-lattices, and to globalize the resulting labellings.  Using the construction given by Pelayo and the second author  in [79], our results prove that semitoric systems  are completely spectrally determined in an algorithmic way~: from  the joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system one can construct a  representative of the isomorphism class of the underlying classical  semitoric system. In particular, this recovers the uniqueness result  obtained by Pelayo and the authors  in [62,61], and completes  it with the explicit computation of all invariants, including the  twisting index.  In the cases of the spin-oscillator and the coupled angular momenta,  we implement the algorithms and illustrate numerically the  computation of the invariants from the joint spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Our work is dedicated to the introduction and investigation of a new asymptotic correlation relation in the field of mean field models and limits. This new notion, order (as opposed to chaos), revolves around a tendency for self organisation in a given system and is expected to be observed in biological and societal models. Beyond the definition of this new notion, our work will show its applicability, and propagation, in the so-called Choose the Leader model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized cycles can be thought of as the extension of form-cycle duality between holomorphic forms and cycles, to meromorphic forms and generalized cycles. They appeared as an ubiquitous tool in the study of spectral curves and integrable systems in the topological recursion approach. They parametrize deformations, implementing the special geometry, where moduli are periods, and derivatives with respect to moduli are other periods, or more generally "integrals", whence the name "generalized cycles". They appeared over the years in various works, each time in specific applied frameworks, and here we provide a comprehensive self-contained corpus of definitions and properties for a very general setting. The geometry of generalized cycles is also fascinating by itself.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-range one-dimensional Riesz gas on the circle, a continuous system of particles interacting through a Riesz kernel. We establish near-optimal rigidity estimates on gaps valid at any scale. Leveraging on these local laws together with Stein's method, we prove a quantitative Central Limit Theorem for linear statistics. The proof is based on a mean-field transport and a fine analysis of the fluctuations of local error terms using various convexity and monotonicity arguments. By using a comparison principle for the Helffer-Sj\"ostrand equation, the method can handle very singular test-functions, including characteristic functions of intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a unitary evolution $U$ on a multi-partite quantum system and an ensemble of initial states, how well can $U$ be simulated by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) on that ensemble? We answer this question by establishing a general, efficiently computable upper bound on the maximal LOCC simulation fidelity -- what we call an 'LOCC inequality'. We then apply our findings to the fundamental setting where $U$ implements a quantum Newtonian Hamiltonian over a gravitationally interacting system. Violation of our LOCC inequality can rule out the LOCCness of the underlying evolution, thereby establishing the non-classicality of the gravitational dynamics, which can no longer be explained by a local classical field. As a prominent application of this scheme we study systems of quantum harmonic oscillators initialised in coherent states following a normal distribution and interacting via Newtonian gravity, and discuss a possible physical implementation with torsion pendula. One of our main technical contributions is the analytical calculation of the above LOCC inequality for this family of systems. As opposed to existing tests based on the detection of gravitationally mediated entanglement, our proposal works with coherent states alone, and thus it does not require the generation of largely delocalised states of motion nor the detection of entanglement, which is never created at any point in the process.</description>

      <title>On the running and the UV limit of Wilsonian renormalization group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman type field correlators. Such a flow is a parametric family of ultraviolet (UV) regularized field correlators, the parameter being the strength of the UV regularization, and the instances with different strength of UV regularizations are linked by the renormalization group equation (RGE). Important RG flows are those which reach out to any UV regularization strengths. In this paper it is shown that for these flows a natural, mathematically rigorous generally covariant definition can be given, and that they form a topological vector space which is Hausdorff, locally convex, complete, nuclear, semi-Montel, Schwartz. That is, they form a generalized function space having favorable properties, similar to multivariate distributions. The other theorem proved in the paper is that for Wilsonian RG flows reaching out to all UV regularization strengths, a simple factorization formula holds in case of bosonic fields over flat (affine) spacetime: the flow always originates from a regularization-independent distributional correlator, and its running satisfies an algebraic ansatz. The conjecture is that this factorization theorem should generically hold, which is worth future investigations.</description>

Abstract: We study 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ theories derived from compactifying class $\mathcal{S}$ theories on $S^2$ with a topological twist. We present concise expressions for the elliptic genera of both classes of theories, revealing the TQFT structure on Riemann surfaces $C_{g,n}$. Furthermore, our study highlights the relationship between the left-moving sector of the (0,2) theory and the chiral algebra of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory. Notably, we propose that the (0,2) elliptic genus of a theory of this class can be expressed as a linear combination of characters of the corresponding chiral algebra.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the quantum algebraic formalism of the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$, where D2/D4/D6/D8-branes are present. We demonstrate that the contour integral formulas have free field interpretations, leading to the operator formalism of $qq$-characters associated with each D-brane. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence.
  Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations, $q$-characters, and the Bethe ansatz equations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$. This connection provides insights into the Bethe/Gauge correspondence of the gauge origami system from both gauge-theoretic and quantum-algebraic perspectives.
  We finally present conjectures regarding generalizations to general toric Calabi-Yau four-folds. These generalizations imply the existence of an extensive class of $qq$-characters, which we call BPS $qq$-characters. These BPS $qq$-characters offer a new systematic approach to derive a broader range of BPS/CFT correspondence and Bethe/Gauge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Representations of Ordered Exponentials: Vector-Valued Schr\"odinger Semigroups and the Combinatorics of Anderson Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide two applications of an elementary (yet seemingly unknown) probabilistic representation of matrix ordered exponentials, which generalizes the Feynman-Kac formula in finite dimensions and the change of measure formula between two continuous-time Markov processes on a finite state space.
  Our first and main application consists of a new Feynman-Kac formula for a class of vector-valued Schr\"odinger operators on the line, which is driven by two sources of randomness: The usual Brownian motion, and a continuous-time Markov process on a finite state space. An important feature of these formulas -- which is at the core of our motivation -- is that they enable the calculation of the joint moments of the semigroup kernels when the matrix potential function contains a continuous Gaussian noise. In particular, our moment formulas shed new light on what the joint moments of the Feynman-Kac kernels of the multivariate stochastic Airy operators of Bloemendal and Vir\'ag (Ann. Probab., 44(4):2726--2769, 2016.) should be; we state a precise conjecture to that effect, which we pursue in a forthcoming paper.
  Our second application consists of Feynman-Kac formulas for the expected square modulus $\mathbf E\big[|\Psi(t,x)|^2\big]$ of the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation $\partial_t\Psi=-\mathsf i\mathcal H(t)\Psi$ with a time-dependent Hamiltonian $\mathcal H(t)$. Using this, we show that when we take $\mathcal H(t)=-\Delta+q(t,x)$ restricted to a finite box within $\mathbb Z^d$, where $q(t,x)$ is a possibly time-dependent Gaussian process, $\mathbf E\big[|\Psi(t,x)|^2\big]$ can be written as a relatively simple expectation that involves self- and mutual-intersections of random walks. In particular, this formula hints at a unified combinatorial mechanism that explains the occurrence of localization for both time-dependent and time-independent noises.</description>

Abstract: The derivation of an approximate Class-I model for nonisothermal multicomponent systems of fluids, as the high-friction limit of a Class-II model is justified, by validating the Chapman-Enskog expansion performed from the Class-II model towards the Class-I model. The analysis proceeds by comparing two thermomechanical theories via relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum circuits for port-based teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a variant of quantum teleportation that, unlike the canonical protocol by Bennett et al., does not require a correction operation on the teleported state. Since its introduction by Ishizaka and Hiroshima in 2008, no efficient implementation of PBT was known. We close this long-standing gap by building on our recent results on representations of partially transposed permutation matrix algebras and mixed quantum Schur transform. We construct efficient quantum algorithms for probabilistic and deterministic PBT protocols on $n$ ports of arbitrary local dimension, both for EPR and optimized resource states. We describe two constructions based on different encodings of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for $n$ qudits: a standard encoding that achieves $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time and $O(n\log(n))$ space complexity, and a Yamanouchi encoding that achieves $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ time and $O(\log(n))$ space complexity, both for constant local dimension and target error. We also describe efficient circuits for preparing the optimal resource states.</description>

      <title>Partition functions for non-commutative harmonic oscillators and related divergent series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heat kernel (or propagator) of the quantum harmonic oscillator (qHO) is given by the Mehler formula, and the partition function is obtained by taking its trace. In general, the spectral zeta function of the given system is obtained by the Mellin transform of its partition function. In the case of non-commutative harmonic oscillators (NCHO), however, the heat kernel and partition functions are still unknown, although meromorphic continuation of the corresponding spectral zeta function and special values at positive integer points have been studied. On the other hand, explicit formulas for the heat kernel and partition function have been obtained for the quantum Rabi model (QRM), which is the simplest and most fundamental model for light and matter interaction in addition to having the NCHO as a covering model. In this paper, we propose a notion of the quasi-partition function for a quantum interaction model if the corresponding spectral zeta function can be meromorphically continued to the whole complex plane. The quasi-partition function for qHO and QRM actually gives the partition function. Assuming that this holds for the NCHO (currently a conjecture), we can find various interesting properties for the spectrum of the NCHO. Moreover, although we cannot expect any functional equation of the spectral zeta function for the quantum interaction models, we try to seek if there is some relation between the special values at positive and negative points. Attempting to seek this, we encounter certain divergent series expressing formally the Hurwitz zeta function by calculating integrals of the partition functions. We then give two interpretations of these divergent series by the Borel summation and $p$-adically convergent series defined by the $p$-adic Hurwitz zeta function.</description>

      <title>Extreme value statistics of nerve transmission delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nerve transmission delay is an important topic in neuroscience. Spike signals fired or received at the dendrites of a neuron travel from the axon to the presynaptic cell. The spike signal triggers a chemical reaction at the synapse, wherein a presynaptic cell transfers neurotransmitters to the postsynaptic cell, and regenerates electrical signals by a chemical reaction process through ion channels and transmits it to neighboring neurons. In the context of describing the complex physiological reaction process as a stochastic process, this study aimed to show that the distribution of the maximum time interval of spike signals follows extreme order statistics. By considering the statistical variance in the time constant of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model, which is a deterministic time evolution model of spike signals, we enabled randomness in the time interval of spike signals. When the time constant follows an exponential distribution function, the time interval of the spike signal also follows an exponential distribution. In this case, our theory and simulations confirmed that the histogram of the maximum time interval follows the Gumbel distribution, which is one of the three types of extreme value statistics. We also confirmed that the histogram of the maximum time interval follows a Fr\'{e}chet distribution when the time interval of the spike signal follows a Pareto distribution. These findings confirm that nerve transmission delay can be described using extreme value statistics and could, therefore, be used as a new indicator for transmission delay.</description>

      <title>$(2,2p+1)$ minimal string and intersection theory I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

Abstract: A certain two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory is argued to satisfy a relation that promotes the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation to an infrared duality between two quantum field theories. Solutions of the tetrahedron equation with continuous spin variables are obtained from partition functions of this theory and its variants.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a series representation for the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge. Two distinct, yet closely related formulas are needed for the cases $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ and $c &lt;1$. We also conjecture that the formulas have a well-defined limit as the central charge approaches rational values. Our proposal for $c &lt;1$ agrees numerically with the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks, whereas our proposal for $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ agrees numerically with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula for the fusion kernel. The case of the modular kernel is studied as a special case of the fusion kernel.</description>

      <title>Classical Mechanics in Noncommutative Spaces: Confinement and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a semi-classical approximation to the dynamics of a point particle in a noncommutative space. In this approximation, the noncommutativity of space coordinates is described by a Poisson bracket. For linear Poisson brackets, the corresponding phase space is given by the cotangent bundle of a Lie group, with the Lie group playing the role of a curved momentum space. We show that the curvature of the momentum space may lead to rather unexpected physical phenomena such as an upper bound on the velocity of a free nonrelativistic particle, bounded motion for repulsive central force, and no-fall-into-the-centre for attractive Coulomb potential. We also consider a superintegrable Hamiltonian for the Kepler problem in $3$-space with $su(2)$ noncommutativity. The leading correction to the equations of motion due to noncommutativity is shown to be described by an effective monopole potential.</description>

      <title>The Convergence Problem Of Gradient Expansion In The Relaxation Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>
