      <title>An X-ray view of the Cataclysmic Variable V902 Mon: Discovery of an X-ray eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V902 Mon is one of a few eclipsing Intermediate Polars (IPs), and show deep eclipses in the optical lightcurves. The presence of a strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line in its X-ray spectrum and its low X-ray flux compared to other IPs suggests significant absorption, most likely from an accretion disk. In an observation carried out using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), we confirm the presence of an X-ray eclipse in the energy resolved lightcurves, coincident with the optical AAVSO/CV-band lightcurves. Broadband X-ray spectral analysis using NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations confirm a strong absorption N$_{H}$ $\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ local to the source, along with a high equivalent width of about 0.7 keV for a Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line. We interpret this using a model similar to an Accretion Disk Corona source, which have a very high inclination and the compact object is heavily obscured by the body of the accretion disk. We propose that the primary X-rays from the accretion column in V902 Mon is hidden from our direct view at all times by the accretion disk. In this scenario, the observed scattered X-rays indicate substantial absorption of direct X-rays by the accretion disk. Additionally, a strong Fe fluorescence line suggests reprocessing of the radiation by a more extended region, such as the pre-shock region, which could be located a few white dwarf radii above the orbital plane.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for the Relativistic Inverse Stellar Structure Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic inverse stellar structure problem determines the equation of state of the stellar matter given a knowledge of suitable macroscopic observable properties (e.g. their masses and radii) of the stars composed of that material. This study determines how accurately this equation of state can be determined using noisy mass and radius observations. The relationship between the size of the observational errors and the accuracy of the inferred equation of state is evaluated, and the optimal number of adjustable equation of state parameters needed to achieve the highest accuracy is determined.</description>

      <title>Evolution of LISA Observables for Binary Black Holes Lensed by an SMBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBH) are expected to form and merge in active galactic nuclei (AGN), deep in the potential well of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), from populations that exist in a nuclear star cluster (NSC). Here we investigate the gravitational wave (GW) signature of a BBH lensed by a nearby SMBH. For a fiducial GW150914-like BBH orbiting close to a $10^{8}M_{\odot}$ SMBH located at $z=0.1$, the lensed GW signal varies in a predictable manner in and out of the LISA detectability band and across frequencies. The occurrence of such signatures has the potential to confound LISA global fit models if they are not modelled. Detection of these sources provide an independent measure of AGN inclination angles, along with detecting warping of the inner disk, and measuring the SMBH spin.</description>

      <title>Revealing an unexpectedly low electron injection threshold via reinforced shock acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, found in supernova remnants, interstellar, stellar, and planetary environments, and laboratories, are one of nature's most powerful particle accelerators. This study combines in situ satellite measurements with recent theoretical developments to establish a reinforced shock acceleration model for relativistic electrons. Our model incorporates transient structures, wave-particle interactions, and variable stellar wind conditions, operating collectively in a multiscale set of processes. We show that the electron injection threshold is on the order of suprathermal range, obtainable through multiple different phenomena abundant in various plasma environments. Our analysis demonstrates that a typical shock can consistently accelerate electrons into very high (relativistic) energy ranges, refining our comprehension of shock acceleration while providing insight on the origin of electron cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Prompt and Conventional High-Energy Muon Spectra from a full Monte Carlo Simulation via $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive air showers produce high-energy muons that can be utilized to probe hadronic interaction models in cosmic ray interactions. Most muons originate from pion and kaon decays, called $\textit{conventional}$ muons, while a smaller fraction, referred to as $\textit{prompt}$ muons, arises from the decay of heavier, short-lived hadrons. The $\texttt{EHISTORY}$ option of the air shower simulation tool $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$ is used in this work to investigate the prompt and conventional muon flux in the energy range of 100 TeV to 100 PeV, utilizing the newly developed open-source python software $\texttt{PANAMA}$. Identifying the muon parent particles allows for scaling the contribution of prompt particles, which can be leveraged by future experimental analyses to measure the normalization of the prompt muon flux. Obtained prompt muon spectra from $\texttt{CORSIKA7}$ are compared to $\texttt{MCEq}$ results. The relevance to large-volume neutrino detectors, such as IceCube and KM3NeT, and the connection to hadronic interaction models is discussed.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of the composition of Type I X-ray burst ashes: Neutron star structure v.s. Reaction rate uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we calculate for the first time the impacts of neutron star(NS) structure on the type I X-ray burst ashes using the \texttt{MESA} code. We find an increased mass fraction of the heavier elements with increasing surface gravity (increase mass or decrease radius), resulting in a higher average mass number ($A_{\rm ash}$) of burst ashes (except for higher mass NS due to the competition between the envelope temperature and the recurrence time). The burst strength ($\alpha$) increases as surface gravity increases, which indicates the positive correlation between $A_{\rm ash}$ and $\alpha$ with changes in surface gravity. If the $\alpha$ value is higher, heavier $p$-nuclei should be produced by the type I X-ray burst nucleosynthesis. Besides, the effects of various burst input parameters, e.g. base heating ($Q_{\rm b}$), metallicity ($Z$) and some new reaction rates are calculated for comparison. We find that the heavier nuclei synthesis is inversely correlated to the base heating/metallicity, the smaller the base heating/metallicity, the greater the mass fraction of the heavier elements. The $\alpha$ value decreases as $Q_{\rm b}$ or $Z$ decreases, which also indicates the positive correlation between $A_{\rm ash}$ and $\alpha$ with variation in $Q_{\rm b}$ or $Z$. The new reaction rates from the $(p,\gamma)$ reactions on $^{17}\rm{F}$, $^{19}\rm{F}$, $^{26}\rm{P}$, $^{56}\rm{Cu}$, $^{65}\rm{As}$, and $(\alpha,p)$ reaction on $^{22}\rm{Mg}$ have only minimal effects on burst ashes. In hydrogen-rich X-ray binary systems, nuclei heavier than $^{64}\rm{Ge}$ are fertile produced with larger NS mass, smaller NS radius, smaller base heating and smaller metallicity.</description>

      <title>Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets: II. Viewing Angle Effect on the Prompt Emission and Application to GRB 170817A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations suggest that the gamma-ray burst on Aug. 17, 2017 (GRB 170817A) resulted from off-axial observations of its structured jet, which consists of a narrow ultra-relativistic jet core surrounded by a wide mild-relativistic cocoon. In a serious paper, we explore the emission of shear-accelerated electrons in the mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region in a series of papers. This paper focuses on the viewing angle effect for a structured jet by considering the emission from the shear-accelerated electrons. It is found that the observed synchrotron emission peaks at the Infrared band and the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission peaks at the band of hundreds of keV. They are not sensitive to the viewing angle. In the off-axis observations scenario, the prompt emission spectrum is dominated by the emission of the shear-accelerated electrons. The prompt gamma-ray spectrum of GRB 170817A can be well explained with our model by setting the velocity of the inner edge of the cocoon region as 0.9c, the magnetic field strength as 21 G, the injected initial electron Lorentz factor as $10^3$, and the viewing angle as 0.44 rad. We argue that the joint observations in the Infrared/optical and X-ray bands are critical to verify our model.</description>

      <title>Repeating fast radio bursts from synchrotron maser radiation in localized plasma blobs: Application to FRB 20121102A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation physics of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains enigmatic. Motivated by the observed narrow-banded emission spectrum and ambiguous fringe pattern of the spectral peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm pk}$) distribution of some repeating FRBs, such as FRB 20121102A, we propose that the bursts from repeating FRBs arise from synchrotron maser radiation in localized blobs within weakly magnetized plasma that relativistically moves toward observers. Assuming the plasma moves toward the observers with a bulk Lorentz factor of $\Gamma=100$ and the electron distribution in an individual blob is monoenergetic ($\gamma_{\rm e}\sim300$), our analysis shows that bright and narrow-banded radio bursts with peak flux density $\sim$ 1 ${\rm Jy}$ at peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm pk}$) $\sim 3.85$ GHz can be produced by the synchrotron maser emission if the plasma blob has a magnetization factor of $\sigma\sim10^{-5}$ and a frequency of $\nu_{\rm P}\sim 4.5$ MHz. The spectrum of bursts with lower $\nu_{\rm pk}$ tends to be narrower. Applying our model to the bursts of FRB 20121102A, the distributions of both the observed $\nu_{\rm pk}$ and isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso}$ detected by the Arecibo telescope at the L band and the Green Bank Telescope at the C band are successfully reproduced. We find that the $\nu_{\rm P}$ distribution exhibits several peaks, similar to those observed in the $\nu_{\rm pk}$ distribution of FRB 20121102A. This implies that the synchrotron maser emission in FRB 20121102A is triggered in different plasma blobs with varying $\nu_{\rm P}$, likely due to the inhomogeneity of relativistic electron number density.</description>

      <title>A Possible Four-Month Periodicity in the Activity of FRB 20240902A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients from distant galaxies. While most FRBs are singular events, repeaters emit multiple bursts, with only two-FRB 121102 and FRB 180916B-showing periodic activity (160 and 16 days, respectively). FRB 20240209A, discovered by CHIME-FRB, is localized to the outskirts of a quiescent elliptical galaxy ($z = 0.1384$). We discovered a periodicity of $\sim 126$ days in the activity of FRB 20240209A, making it the third FRB with confirmed periodicity. We used auto-correlation and Lomb-Scargle periodogram analyses, validated with randomized control samples, to confirm the periodicity. The FRB's location in an old stellar population disfavors young progenitor models, instead pointing to scenarios involving globular clusters, late-stage magnetars, or low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Though deep X-ray or polarimetric observations are not available, the localization of the FRB and a possible periodicity point to a binary progenitor likely involving a compact object and a stellar companion.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Local Universe Fast Radio Bursts from CHIME/FRB and the KKO Outrigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first catalog of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies from CHIME/FRB Outriggers, selected uniformly in the radio and the optical by localizing 81 new bursts to 2'' x ~60'' accuracy using CHIME and the KKO Outrigger, located 66 km from CHIME. Of the 81 localized bursts, we use the Probabilistic Association of Transients to their Hosts (PATH) algorithm to securely identify 21 new FRB host galaxies, and compile spectroscopic redshifts for 19 systems, 15 of which are newly obtained via spectroscopic observations. The most nearby source is FRB 20231229A, at a distance of 90 Mpc. One burst in our sample is from a previously reported repeating source in a galaxy merger (FRB 20190303A). Three new FRB host galaxies (FRBs 20230203A, 20230703A, and 20231206A) are found towards X-ray and optically selected galaxy clusters, potentially doubling the sample of known galaxy cluster FRBs. A search for radio counterparts reveals that FRB 20231128A is associated with a luminous persistent radio source (PRS) candidate with high significance ($P_{cc} \sim 10^{-2}$). If its compactness is confirmed, it would be the nearest known compact PRS at $z = 0.1079$. Our catalog significantly increases the statistics of the Macquart relation at low redshifts ($z &lt; 0.2$). In the near future, the completed CHIME/FRB Outriggers array will produce hundreds of FRBs localized with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). This will significantly expand the known sample and pave the way for future telescopes relying on VLBI for FRB localization.</description>

      <title>The blazar PKS 0605-085 as the origin of the KM3-230213A ultra high energy neutrino event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KM3Net Collaboration has recently reported on the observation of a remarkable event KM3-230213A that could have been produced by an ultra high energy cosmic neutrino. The origin of this event is still unclear. In particular, the cosmogenic neutrino scenario is not favoured due to the non-observation of a similar event by the IceCube detector, and most galactic scenarios are disfavoured as well. We show that the blazar PKS 0605-085 is a viable source of the KM3-230213A event. In particular, even though this blazar is located at 2.4$^{\circ}$ from the KM3-230213A event, the association between the blazar and the event is not unlikely due to a sizable direction systematic uncertainty of $\approx 1.5^{\circ}$ reported by the KM3Net Collaboration. Furthermore, we show that the observation of a $\approx$72 PeV neutrino from PKS 0605-085 is entirely possible given that a $\approx$7.5 PeV neutrino could have been observed from another blazar TXS 0506+056. Finally, we consider $\gamma$-ray constraints on the number of observable neutrino events and show that for the case of the external photon field production mechanism these constraints could be relaxed due to the often-neglected effect of the isotropisation of the hadronically-produced electrons in the magnetic field of the blob. We encourage further multi-wavelength observations of the blazar PKS 0605-085.</description>

      <title>The nature of gravitational wave events with host environment escape velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. It also enables testing general relativity and improves source localization, which the latter is instrumental in multi-messenger astronomy. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events originating from globular clusters. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 240529A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) whose light curve of prompt emission is composed of a triple-episode structure, separated by quiescent gaps of tens to hundreds of seconds. More interestingly, its X-ray light curve of afterglow exhibits two-plateau emissions, namely, an internal plateau emission that is smoothly connected with a $\sim t^{-0.1}$ segment and followed by a $\sim t^{-2}$ power-law decay. The three episodes in the prompt emission, together with two plateau emissions in X-ray, are unique in the Swift era. They are very difficult to explain with the standard internal/external shock model by invoking a black hole central engine. However, it could be consistent with the prediction of a supramassive magnetar as the central engine, the physical process of phase transition from magnetar to strange star, as well as the cooling and spin-down of the strange star. In this paper, we propose that the first- and second-episode emissions in the prompt $\gamma-$ray of GRB 240529A are from the jet emission of a massive star collapsing into a supramassive magnetar and the re-activity of central engine, respectively. Then, the third-episode emission of prompt is attributed to the phase transition from a magnetar to a strange star. Finally, the first- and second-plateau emissions of the X-ray afterglow are powered by the cooling and spin-down of the strange star, respectively. The observational data of each component of GRB 240529A are roughly coincident with the estimations of the above physical picture.</description>

      <title>A Search for Low-frequency Radio Pulses from Long Gamma-ray Bursts with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that coherent radio emission could be emitted during or shortly following a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Here we present a low-frequency ($170-200$ MHz) search for radio pulses associated with long-duration GRBs using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The MWA, with its rapid-response system, is capable of performing GRB follow-up observations within approximately $30$ seconds. Our single pulse search, with temporal and spectral resolutions of $100\ \mu$s and $10$ kHz, covers dispersion measures up to $5000$ pc cm$^{-3}$. Two single pulse candidates are identified with significance greater than $6\sigma$, surviving a friends-of-friends analysis. We rule out random fluctuations as their origin at a confidence level of $97\%$ ($2.2\sigma$). We caution that radio frequency interference from digital TV (DTV) is most likely the origin of these pulses since the DTV frequency bands almost cover the entire observing frequency band. If they are astrophysical signals, we estimate the peak flux densities for our pulse candidates of $3.6\pm0.6$ Jy and $10.5\pm1.5$ Jy, with corresponding fluences of $431\pm74$ Jy ms and $211\pm37$ Jy ms, respectively. Based on these observations and the assumption of a magnetar origin for the pulse, we constrain the radio emission efficiency as $\epsilon_{\rm{r}}\sim10^{-3}$ for both candidates, which is consistent with pulsar observations. Our results highlight the promising potential of new-generation radio telescopes like the MWA to probe the central engines of GRBs.</description>

      <title>New Potential Ultra-compact X-ray Binaries for Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors From Low-Mass Main-Sequence Companion Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and evolution of Ultra-Compact X-ray Binaries (UCXBs) using the COMPAS binary evolution code, starting from the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS). Focusing on the low-mass MS companion channel, we simulate gravitational wave (GW) signals from UCXBs with LEGWORK and evaluate their detectability by space-based observatories such as Taiji and TianQin. By incorporating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculations with a threshold of SNR &gt; 5, we provide a realistic framework to assess the detectability of the GW source. Our analysis suggests that the Milky Way currently hosts 7-32 observable UCXBs from the MS companion channel. Taiji or LISA alone could detect 1-6 sources over an 8-year observation period, while TianQin, due to its high-frequency sensitivity, contributes to detecting systems with extremely short orbital periods and can also detect 1-4 sources. Comparison with sensitivity curves validates UCXBs as detectable GW sources, particularly at greater Galactic distances. This study improves our understanding of the evolution of UCXBs and their role as GW sources. By integrating population synthesis, SNR-based analyses, and observational data, we establish UCXBs as significant targets for GW astronomy, paving the way for future missions and theoretical studies of compact binary systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Most Extreme Gamma-Ray Blazars Using Broadband Spectral Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme high-synchrotron peaked blazars (EHSPs) are rare high-energy sources characterised by synchrotron peaks beyond 10$^{17}$ Hz in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Their extreme properties challenge conventional blazar emission models and provide a unique opportunity to test the limits of particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in relativistic jets. However, the number of identified EHSPs is still small, limiting comprehensive studies of their population and characteristics. This study aims to identify new EHSP candidates and characterise their emission properties. A sample of 124 $\gamma$-ray blazars is analysed, selected for their high synchrotron peak frequencies and $\gamma$-ray emission properties, with a focus on sources showing low variability and good broadband data coverage. Their SEDs are constructed using archival multi-wavelength data from the SSDC SED Builder service, supplemented with recent Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, and Fermi-LAT observations. The SEDs are modelled with a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron-self-Compton framework, classifying sources by synchrotron peak frequency. We identify 66 new EHSP candidates, significantly expanding the known population. Their synchrotron peak frequencies are statistically higher than in previous studies, and they exhibit low Compton dominance, consistent with environments lacking strong external photon fields. A clear correlation between synchrotron peak frequency and the magnetic-to-kinetic energy density ratio is found, with the most extreme EHSPs nearing equipartition. Our analysis suggests that 9 high-synchrotron peaked/EHSPs could be observed by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) at $&gt;5\sigma$ (20 at $&gt;3\sigma$) in 20-hour exposures, highlighting their potential to improve studies of extreme jet physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraining first-order phase transition inside neutron stars with application of Bayesian techniques on PSR J0437-4715 NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the existence of exotic matter phases and phase transitions within the core of neutron stars is crucial to advancing our knowledge of cold-dense matter physics. Recent multimessenger observations, including gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and precise X-ray data from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission, have significantly constrained the neutron star equation of state (EOS). This study investigates the effects of phase transitions in neutron stars, focusing on NICER's latest observation of PSR J0437$-$4715. We employ Bayesian inference techniques to evaluate the presence of first-order phase transitions using a piecewise polytropic EOS model. Our analysis incorporates data from multiple NICER sources, to refine constraints on key phase transition parameters, including critical density and transition depth. We find that including data from PSR J0437$-$4715 improves the evidence of phase transitions and tightens the EOS constraints, especially at higher densities. However, Bayes factor analysis only indicates a slight preference for models without phase transitions and current observational precision is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In particular, this polytropic model identifies the critical phase transition mass of neutron stars as being close to 1.4 solar masses, concincide with the rough mass range of PSR J0437$-$4715. This work emphasizes the importance of precise measurements of PSR J0437$-$4715 for deepening our understanding of neutron star interiors and exploring potential new physics at extreme densities.</description>

      <title>Exploring lensing signatures through spectrotemporal correlations: implications for black hole parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts, combined together, imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times, leading to spectrotemporal correlations in observed signals. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. Here, motivated by these prospects, we numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. We make use of the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code to generate the light curves we then correlate. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions. The computation transcends past analytical approximations, studying the main contribution to the correlation function, which is not deep in the universal regime. We compute correlation maps for many combinations of black hole mass, spin, inclination, hotspot width, and orbital radius, and study their dependence on these parameters. The correlation maps are then used to train convolutional neural networks which can be used to estimate source parameters, achieving promisingly low evaluation errors within the model. Our results could be relevant for future X-ray spectroscopic missions, offering insights into black hole parameter inference.</description>

      <title>KM3NeT Constraint on Lorentz-Violating Superluminal Neutrino Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime and foundational to modern physics. One of its most important consequences is the constancy of the speed of light. This invariance, together with the geometry of spacetime, implies that no particle can move faster than the speed of light. In this article, we present the most stringent neutrino-based test of this prediction, using the highest energy neutrino ever detected to date, KM3-230213A. The arrival of this event, with an energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}\,\text{PeV}$, sets a constraint on $\delta \equiv c_\nu^2-1 &lt; 4\times10^{-22}$.</description>

      <title>General relativistic quasi-spherical accretion in a dark matter halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The Bondi spherical accretion solution has been used to model accretion onto compact objects in a variety of situations, from interpretation of observations to subgrid models in cosmological simulations. Aims. We aim to investigate how the presence of dark matter (DM) alters the dynamics and physical properties of accretion onto supermassive black holes on scales ranging from ~ 10 pc to the event horizon. Methods. In particular, we investigate Bondi-like accretion flows with zero and low specific angular momentum around supermassive black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos by performing 1D and 2.5D general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) simulations using the black hole accretion code (BHAC). Results. We find notable differences in the dynamics and structure of spherical accretion flows in the presence of DM. The most significant effects include increases in density, temperature, and pressure, as well as variations in radial velocity both inside and outside the regions containing DM or even the production of outflow. Conclusions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the role of cosmological effects, particularly DM, in shaping the behavior of accretion flows and black holes (BHs). Our simulations may be directly applicable to model systems with a large black hole-to-halo mass ratio, which are expected to be found at very high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Using Infrared Dust Echoes to Identify Bright Quasi-periodic Eruption Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring soft X-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei and represent an intriguing new class of transients. Currently, 10 QPE sources are reported in the literature, and a major challenge lies in identifying more because they are (apparently) intrinsically and exclusively X-ray bright. Here we highlight the unusual infrared (IR) echo of the tidal disruption event (TDE) -- and subsequent QPE source -- AT2019qiz, which rose continuously and approximately linearly with time over roughly 1000 days (between 2019 and 2024). We argue that this continuous long rise alongside the relatively high inferred IR temperature (800-1200 K) cannot be generated by the TDE itself, including the late-time/remnant TDE disk, but that the reprocessing of the light from the QPEs by a shell of dust can reproduce the observations. This model predicts 1) IR QPEs at the 0.1 percent level that are potentially detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope, and 2) that if the QPEs cease in AT2019qiz, the IR light curve should decline steadily and linearly over the same 1000-day timescale. We identify another TDE with similar IR behavior, AT2020ysg, which could thus harbor QPEs. Our findings and inferences constitute a novel method for identifying ``bright'' QPEs (with peak bolometric luminosities $\gtrsim$10$^{44}$ erg/sec), i.e., that the follow-up of optically selected TDEs with wide-field infrared surveys can indirectly reveal the presence of QPEs. This approach could be particularly effective with the upcoming Roman telescope, which could detect dozens of QPE candidates for high-cadence X-ray follow-up.</description>

      <title>Bondi-like Accretion Flow Dynamics: The Role of Gravitational Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of massive black holes and their coevolution with host galaxies are pivotal areas of modern astrophysics. Spherical accretion onto a central point mass serves as a foundational frame- work in cosmological simulations, semianalytical models, and observational studies. This work extends the classical spherical accretion model by incorporating the gravitational potential of host galaxies, including contributions from stellar components and dark matter halos. Numerical solutions spanning parsec-scale to event-horizon-scale regimes reveal that the flow structure is highly sensitive to the mass and size of the dark matter halo. Adding low angular momentum to the accreting gas demonstrates that such flows resemble spherical Bondi accretion, with mass accretion rates converging towards the Bondi rate. We find that the low angular momentum flow resembles the spherical Bondi flow and its mass accretion rate approaches the Bondi accretion rate. Due to the presence of dark matter, the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of more than ~ %100 in comparison to analogous hydrodynamic solutions. These findings underscore the critical role of stellar and dark matter gravitational poten- tials in shaping the dynamics and accretion rates of quasi-spherical flows, providing new insights into astrophysical accretion processes.</description>

      <title>Insights from leptohadronic modelling of the brightest blazar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blazar 3C 454.3 experienced a major flare in November 2010 making it the brightest $\gamma$-ray source in the sky of the Fermi-LAT. We obtain seven daily consecutive spectral-energy distributions (SEDs) of the flare in the infra-red, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands with publicly available data. We simulate the physical conditions in the blazar and show that the observed SEDs are well reproduced in the framework of a "standing feature" where the position of the emitting region is almost stationary, located beyond the outer radius of the broad-line region and into which fresh blobs of relativistically moving magnetized plasma are continuously injected. Meanwhile, a model with a single "moving blob" does not describe the data well. We obtain a robust upper limit to the amount of high-energy protons in the jet of 3C 454.3 from the electromagnetic SED. We construct a neutrino light curve of 3C 454.3 and estimate the expected neutrino yield at energies $\geq 100$ TeV for 3C 454.3 to be up to $6 \times 10^{-3}$ $\nu_{\mu}$ per year. Finally, we extrapolate our model findings to the light curves of all Fermi-LAT flat-spectrum radio quasars. We find that next-generation neutrino telescopes are expected to detect approximately one multimessenger ($\gamma + \nu_{\mu}$) flare per year from bright blazars with neutrino peak energy in the hundreds TeV -- hundreds PeV energy range and show that the electromagnetic flare peak can precede the neutrino arrival by months to years.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf: interaction signatures in the spectrum at 445 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the most neaby and brightest Type II supernovae (SNe) of the past decades. A rich set of pre-explosion data provided important insight on the properties of the progenitor star. There has been a wide range of estimated initial masses of 9 - 22 $M{_\odot}$. Early monitoring of the SN also showed the presence of a dense CSM structure near the star ($10^{15}$ cm) that was probably expelled in the last years prior to the explosion. These extended CSM structure can be further probed with late-time observations during the nebular phase. This study is based on a nebular spectrum obtained with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope 445 days after explosion. The SN evolution is analyzed in comparison with a previous spectrum at an age of 259 days, and compared with those of similar SNe II and with synthetic radiation-transfer nebular spectra. The 445-d spectrum exhibits a dramatic evolution with clear signs of ejecta-CSM interaction. The H${\alpha}$ profile shows a complex profile that can be separated into a boxy component arising from the interaction with a CSM shell and a central peaked component that may be due to the radioactive-powered SN ejecta. The CSM shell would be located at a distance of $\approx10^{16}$ cm from the progenitor and it may be associated with mass loss occurring up until $\approx 500 - 1000$ years before the explosion. Similar interaction signatures have been detected in other SNe II, although for events with standard plateau durations this happened at times later than 600 - 700 days. SN 2023ixf appears to belong to a group of SNe II with short plateaus or linear light curves that develop interaction features before $\approx 500$ days. Other lines, such as those from [O I] and [Ca II] appear to be unaffected by the CSM interaction. This allowed us to estimate an initial progenitor mass, which resulted in the relatively low range of 10 - 15 $M{_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>How Theory-laden are Observations of Black Holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the roles general relativistic assumptions play in simulations used in recent observations of black holes including LIGO-Virgo and the Event Horizon Telescope. In both experiments simulations play an ampliative role, enabling the extraction of more information from the data than would be possible otherwise. This comes at a cost of theory-ladenness. We discuss the issue of inferential circularity, which arises in some applications; classify some of the epistemic strategies used to reduce the extent of theory-ladenness; and discuss ways in which these strategies are model independent.</description>

      <title>Spinning spectral sirens: Robust cosmological measurement using mass-spin correlations in the binary black hole population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from compact binary mergers provide a direct measurement of luminosity distance, which, in combination with redshift information, serves as a cosmological probe. In order to statistically infer merger redshifts, the ``spectral standard siren" method relies on features, such as peaks, dips or breaks, in the compact object mass spectrum, which get redshifted in the detector-frame relative to the source-frame. However, if the source-frame location of these features evolves over cosmic time, the spectral siren measurement may be biased. Some features, such as the edges of the pair-instability supernova mass gap, may be more stable than others. We point out that binary black hole (BBH) spins, which are not redshifted in the detector-frame, provide a natural way to identify robust mass scales for spectral siren cosmology. For example, there is recent evidence for a mass scale in the BBH population that separates slowly spinning from more rapidly spinning BBH mergers, consistent with the lower edge of the pair instability gap. Applying our method to data from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third transient catalog, we demonstrate how to isolate this mass scale and produce a robust ``spinning spectral siren" measurement of the Hubble constant: $H_0 = 85^{+99}_{-67}\,\rm{km}\, \rm{s}^{-1} \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, or $H_0 =80^{+60}_{-46}\,\rm{km}\, \rm{s}^{-1} \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ when combined with other mass features, such as the $\sim35\,M_\odot$ peak. We consider the possibility that the source-frame location of the $\sim35\,M_\odot$ peak evolves with redshift, and show that information from black hole spin can be used to mitigate the associated bias for self-calibrating spectral sirens.</description>

      <title>The X-ray Integral Field Unit at the end of the Athena reformulation phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Predictions for the Next Outburst of T Coronae Borealis: It will be the Brightest Classical or Recurrent Nova Ever Observed in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (TCrB) is a recurrent nova (RN) with recorded outbursts in 1866, and 1946 and possible outbursts in 1217 and 1787. It is predicted to explode again in 2025 or 2026 based on multiple observational studies. The system consists of a massive (M$_{wd}$ $\gtrsim$ 1.35 M$_\odot$) white dwarf (WD) and a red giant (M3-M4 III). We have performed 1-D hydrodynamic simulations with NOVA to predict the behavior of the next outburst. These simulations consist of a range of mass accretion rates onto $\sim$1.35 M$_\odot$ WDs, designed to bound the conditions necessary to achieve ignition of an explosion after an $\approx$80 year inter-outburst period. We have used both carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon initial compositions, in order to include the possible ejecta abundances to be measured in the observations of the next outburst. As the WD in the TCrB system is observed to be massive, theoretical predictions reported here imply that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the TNR. Therefore, the secular evolution of the WD may allow it to approach the Chandrasekhar limit and either explode as a Type Ia supernova or undergo accretion induced collapse, depending on its underlying composition. We have followed the evolution of just the WD, after removing the ejected matter from the surface layers. Our intent is to illuminate the mystery of the unique, second, maximum in the two well observed outbursts and we have found conditions that bracket the predictions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O Reaction on the Presupernova Evolution and Explodability of Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the uncertainties of stellar evolution theory, we investigate how the $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate affects the evolution of massive stars for the initial masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 13 - 40 M$_\odot$ and the solar metallicity. We show that the {\sl explodability} of these stars, i.e., which of a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH) is formed, is sensitive to the strength of convective shell burning of C and O, and thus the mass fractions of C ($X$(C)) and O in the shell. For the small $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate that yields larger $X$(C), $X$(C) is further enhanced by mixing of C from the overlying layer and then C shell burning is strengthened. The extra heating by C shell burning tends to prevent the contraction of outer layers and decrease the {\sl compactness parameter} at $M_r$ = 2.5 M$_\odot$. This effect leads to the formation of smaller mass cores of Si and Fe and steeper density and pressure gradients at the O burning shell in the presupernova models. If the pressure gradient there is steeper, the model is more likely to explode to form a NS rather than a BH. We describe the pressure gradient against $M_r$ with $V/U$ and the density drop with $1/U$, where $U$ and $V$ are non-dimensional variables to describe the stellar structure. We estimate the critical values of $V/U$ and $1/U$ at the O-burning shell above which the model is more likely to explode. We conclude that the smaller $^{12}$C($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate makes the mass range of $M ({\rm ZAMS})$ that forms a NS larger.</description>

      <title>The impact of wind accretion in Evolving Symbiotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion scheme applied to binary systems has long struggled to produce reliable mass accretion efficiencies when the stellar wind velocity of the donor star is smaller than the orbital velocity of the accretor. This limitation is significant in symbiotic systems where such conditions exist. Recently, our group introduced a geometric correction to the standard implementation of the BHL model that demonstrates improved agreement with numerical simulations. The present work investigates the impact of this new implementation on the evolution of symbiotic systems. We model systems where 0.7 and 1 M$_\odot$ white dwarfs accrete material from Solar-like stars with initial masses of 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. The primary star is evolved using the MESA stellar evolution code, while the orbital dynamics of the system are calculated using REBOUND. The analysis focuses on the red giant branch and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phases. We compare three scenarios: no accretion, standard BHL accretion, and the improved wind accretion. Our results show that the choice of accretion prescription critically influences the evolution of symbiotic systems. Simulations using the modified model did not reach the Chandrasekhar limit, suggesting that type Ia supernova progenitors require accretors originating from ultra-massive WDs. In contrast, the standard BHL model predicts WD growth to this limit in compact systems. This discrepancy suggests that population synthesis studies adopting the traditional BHL approach may yield inaccurate results. The revised model successfully reproduces the accretion properties of observed symbiotic systems and predicts transitions between different accretion regimes driven by donor mass-loss variability. These results emphasize the need for updated wind accretion models to accurately describe the evolution of symbiotic binaries.</description>

      <title>SFTs: a scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework based on Short-time Fourier Transforms (SFTs) to analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries. Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation ground-based detectors and massive black-hole binaries observed by the LISA space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and parallelizable implementation of the gravitational-wave inner product, a core operation of gravitational-wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise non-stationarities, data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on the specific application, with respect to a standard approach. We release public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and hardware-accelerated re-implementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner product is the key building block of all gravitational-wave data treatments; by speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely promising solution for current and future gravitational-wave data-analysis problem</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Jump relations for magnetrohydrodynamic shock waves in a dusty gas atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:1406.1884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we have derived Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) jump conditions across a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shock front propagating in a dusty gas atmosphere. The dusty gas atmosphere is assumed to be a mixture of a perfect gas and small solid particles, in which small spherical solid particles are continuously distributed. The non-relativistic RH conditions for the pressure, the density, and the fluid velocity across an MHD shock front have been derived in terms of a compression ratio. The simplified forms of RH conditions have been written simultaneously for the weak and strong MHD shock waves in terms of the initial volume fraction of solid particles, the ratio of specific heats of the mixture, and the strength of the magnetic field. Further, the weak and strong shocks have been explored under two distinct conditions, viz., (i) when the applied magnetic field is weak and (ii) when the field is strong. Finally, the effects on the shock velocity and the pressure across the MHD shock front are studied due to the strength of the magnetic field, the concentration of dust particles in the mixture, and the volumetric parameter. This study presents an overview of the influence of the strength of the magnetic field and the dust loading parameters on the shock velocity, the pressure, the density, and the fluid velocity across the MHD shock front.</description>

      <title>GeV emission from a compact binary merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An energetic $\rm \gamma$-ray burst (GRB), GRB 211211A, was observed on 2021 December 11 by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Despite its long duration, typically associated with bursts produced by the collapse of massive stars, the discovery of an optical-infrared kilonova and a quasi-periodic oscillation during a gamma-ray precursor points to a compact object binary merger origin. The complete understanding of this nearby ($\sim$ 1 billion light-years) burst will significantly impact our knowledge of GRB progenitors and the physical processes that lead to electromagnetic emission in compact binary mergers. Here, we report the discovery of a significant ($\rm &gt;5 \sigma$) transient-like emission in the high-energy $\rm \gamma$-rays (HE; E$&gt;0.1$ GeV) observed by Fermi/LAT starting at $10^3$ s after the burst. After an initial phase with a roughly constant flux ($\rm \sim 5\times 10^{-10}\ erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}$) lasting $\sim 2\times 10^4$ s, the flux started decreasing and soon went undetected. The multi-wavelength afterglow emission observed at such late times is usually in good agreement with synchrotron emission from a relativistic shock wave that arises as the GRB jet decelerates in the interstellar medium. However, our detailed modelling of a rich dataset comprising public and dedicated multi-wavelength observations demonstrates that GeV emission from GRB 211211A is in excess with respect to the expectation of this scenario. We explore the possibility that the GeV excess is inverse Compton emission due to the interaction of a long-lived, low-power jet with an external source of photons. We discover that the kilonova emission can provide the necessary seed photons for GeV emission in binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Observing Supernova Neutrino Light Curves with Super-Kamiokande. V. Distance Estimation with Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos are pivotal signals in multi-messenger observations of supernovae (SNe). Recent advancements in the analysis method of supernova (SN) neutrinos, especially in quantitative analysis, have significantly broadened scientific possibilities. This study demonstrates the feasibility of estimating distances to SNe using neutrinos. This estimation utilizes the direct relationship between the radius of a neutron star (NS) and the distance to the SN, which is analogous to main-sequence fitting. The radius of an NS is determined with an approximate uncertainty of 10% through observations such as X-rays and gravitational waves. By integrating this information, the distance to the SN can be estimated with an uncertainty of within 15% at a 95% confidence level. It has been established that neutrinos can pinpoint the direction of SNe, and when combined with distance estimates, three-dimensional localization becomes achievable. This capability is vital for follow-up observations using multi-messenger approaches. Moreover, more precise distance determinations to SNe through follow-up observations, such as optical observations, allow for accurate measurements of NS radii. This data, via the NS mass-radius relationship, could provide various insights into nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of hadronic models on IACT images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The predictions of hadronic interaction models for cosmic-ray induced air showers contain inherent uncertainties due to limitations of available accelerator data. This leads to differences in shower simulations using each of those models. Many studies have been carried out to track those differences by investigating the shower development or the particle content. In this work, we propose a new approach to search for discrepancies and similarities between the models, via the IACT images resulting from the observations of hadronic air showers. We use simulations of H.E.S.S. as a show-case scenario and, by investigating variables of the camera images, we find potential indicators to highlight differences between models. Number of pixels, Hillas image size, and density showed the largest difference between the models. We then further explore the (in)compatibility of the models by combining all the variables and using Boosted Decision Trees. For protons, a significant difference in the classifier output is found for EPOS-LHC when compared to both QGSJET-II04 and Sybill 2.3d. For helium and nitrogen, QGSJET-II04 is shown to be the outlier case. No significant differences are found for silicon and iron. The distribution of (in)compatibility between the models in the phase space of reconstructed shower parameters shows that a targeted search can be fruitful, with showers with reconstructed energies of a few TeV and reconstructed core closer to the large telescope presenting the largest power of separation. An investigation of the distribution of first interaction parameters has shown that EPOS-LHC and QGSJET-II04 result in significantly different distributions of multiplicity and height of first interaction for protons and elasticity and fraction of energy carried by neutral pions for helium and nitrogen.</description>

      <title>On the mechanism of black hole energy reduction in the Blandford-Znajek process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is steady electromagnetic energy release from rotating black holes (BHs) along magnetic field lines threading them and widely believed to drive relativistic jets. This process is successfully demonstrated in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the coordinate system regular on the event horizon, in which the outward Poynting flux on the horizon is considered to reduce BH energy. Meanwhile, alternative pictures for the BH energy reduction that invoke infall of negative energy objects were also discussed, although all of the proposed definitions of the negative energy and/or its infall velocity were ambiguous. We revisit the mechanism of BH energy reduction in the BZ process under the ideal MHD condition by utilizing the coordinate system singular on the horizon, in which the falling membrane of past accreted matter should exist above the horizon. We find that the Poynting flux is produced at the boundary between the falling membrane and the magnetically-dominated inflow, and the front of the inflow creates the negative electromagnetic energy, which reduces the rotational energy of spacetime. We also clarify that the poloidal electric current does not form a closed circuit within the magnetically-dominated flow. Previous interpretations of the BZ process and possibilities of violation of ideal MHD condition and BH charging are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dipolar fluence distribution of statistically isotropic FERMI gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the large-angle distribution of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from the updated FERMI/GBM catalog to probe the statistical isotropy of these astrophysical transient events. We also studied the angular distribution of the GRB fluence as a way to explore whether this radiative feature shows some preferred direction on the sky that suggest their origin. Our model-independent approach performed a directional analysis of the updated FERMI/GBM catalog. The statistical significance of our results is obtained by comparison with a large set of statistically isotropic samples of cosmic objects, with the same features of the FERMI data. Our analyses confirm that the angular distribution of the FERMIGRB is statistically isotropic on the celestial sphere. Moreover, analyzing the directional distribution of the FERMIGRB fluence, that is, the median GRB fluence in a set of directions that scans the celestial sphere, we found that this astrophysical property exhibits a net dipolar structure with a directional preference for latitudes near the Galactic plane. However, additional studies show that this directional preference is not correlated with the Milky Way Galactic plane, which suggests that the GRB dataset, and its fluence dipolar structure, are extra-Galactic in origin. Interestingly, the analyses of the BATSE Channel 4 fluence data, that is, those GRBs from BATSE with energy $&gt;$ 300 keV, reveal that its dipole direction is very well aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole.</description>

      <title>Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet, while many SNRs have been observed in non-thermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma-rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of Herbig-Haro jets on initiating star formation in dense environments. When molecular clouds are nearing gravitational instability, the impact of a protostellar jet could provide the impetus needed to catalyse star formation. A high-energy-density experiment was carried out at the LULI2000 laser facility, where a supersonic jet generated by a nanosecond laser was used to compress a foam or plastic ball, mimicking the interaction of a Herbig-Haro jet with a molecular cloud. Simulations using the 3D radiation hydrodynamics code TROLL provided comprehensive data for analysing ball compression and calculating jet characteristics. After applying scaling laws, similarities between stellar and experimental jets were explored. Diagnostic simulations, including density gradient, emission and X-ray radiographies, showed strong agreement with experimental data. The results of the experiment, supported by simulations, demonstrated that the impact of a protostellar jet on a molecular cloud could reduce the Bonnor-Ebert mass by approximately 9%, thereby initiating collapse.</description>

      <title>First Searches for Dark Matter with the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect dark matter detection methods are used to observe the products of dark matter annihilations or decays originating from astrophysical objects where large amounts of dark matter are thought to accumulate. With neutrino telescopes, an excess of neutrinos is searched for in nearby dark matter reservoirs, such as the Sun and the Galactic Centre, which could potentially produce a sizeable flux of Standard Model particles.
  The KM3NeT infrastructure, currently under construction, comprises the ARCA and ORCA undersea \v{C}erenkov neutrino detectors located at two different sites in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore of Italy and France, respectively. The two detector configurations are optimised for the detection of neutrinos of different energies, enabling the search for dark matter particles with masses ranging from a few GeV/c$^2$ to hundreds of TeV/c$^2$. In this work, searches for dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Centre and the Sun with data samples taken with the first configurations of both detectors are presented. No significant excess over the expected background was found in either of the two analyses. Limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation cross section of dark matter particles are computed for five different primary annihilation channels in the Galactic Centre. For the Sun, limits on the spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering cross sections of dark matter with nucleons are given for three annihilation channels.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger emission from magnetic reconnection in blazar jets: the case of TXS 0506+056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements from astroparticle experiments, such as the 2017 flare associated with the source TXS 0506+056, indicate that blazars act as multi-messenger (MM; radiation and neutrinos) factories. Theoretically, the particle acceleration mechanisms responsible for blazar emissions and the precise location within the jet where this occurs remain undetermined. This paper explores MM emission driven by magnetic reconnection in a blazar jet. Previous studies have shown that reconnection in the magnetically dominated regions of these relativistic jets can efficiently accelerate particles to very high energies (VHE). Assuming that turbulent-driven magnetic reconnection accelerates cosmic-ray protons and electrons by a Fermi process, we developed a lepto-hadronic radiation model without the influence of external soft-photons to explain the 2017 MM flare from TXS 0506+056. In the proposed scenario, the emission blob moves downstream in the jet from $\sim$2 to 4 pc from the central engine, which is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $3 \times 10^{8}$ M$_\odot$ launching a jet with $150L_\mathrm{Edd}$ power. As the blob moves, we observe a sequence of spectral energy distribution (SED) profiles that match the observed arrival of the high energy neutrino and electromagnetic emission from TXS 0506+056. This arrival coincides with the high state of intermediate energy $\gamma$-rays ($E \sim 1 $ GeV) detection, followed by the subsequent appearance of the VHE $\gamma$-ray signal and then no further significant neutrino detection. We obtain a time delay between the neutrino and VHE events $\simeq 6.4$ days, which is consistent with that observed in the 2017 MM flare.</description>

      <title>Maximal Jet Energy of Gamma-Ray Bursts through the Blandford-Znajek Mechanism</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most energetic events in the universe, driven by relativistic jets launched from black holes (BHs) formed during the collapse of massive stars or after the merger of two neutron stars (NSs). The jet power depends on the BH spin and the magnetic flux accreted onto it. In the standard thin disk model, jet power is limited by insufficient magnetic flux, even when the spin approaches maximum possible value. In contrast, the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state limits jet energy by extracting significant angular momentum, braking BH rotation. We propose a unified model incorporating both standard thin disk and MAD states, identifying a universal curve for jet power per accretion rate as a function of the magnetic flux ratio, $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} = (\Phi_\mathrm{BH}/\Phi_\mathrm{MAD})_\mathrm{eq}$, at spin equilibrium. For long GRBs (lGRBs), the model predicts a maximum jet energy of $\sim 1.5\%$ of the accretion energy, occurring at $\Delta_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.4$ where the BH equilibrium spin is $a \sim 0.5$. Both long and short GRBs are unlikely to be produced by a MAD: for short GRBs (sGRBs), this requires an accreted mass orders of magnitude smaller than that available, while for lGRBs, the narrow progenitor mass distribution challenges the ability to produce the observed broad distribution of jet energies. This framework provides a consistent explanation for both standard and luminous GRBs, emphasizing the critical role of magnetic flux. Both long and short GRBs require magnetic flux distributions that peak around $10^{27}\,\mathrm{G\,cm}^2$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing Astrophysical Transients with GeV Neutrinos</title>

Abstract: Although Cherenkov detectors of high-energy neutrinos in ice and water are often optimized to detect TeV-PeV neutrinos, they may also be sensitive to transient neutrino sources in the 1-100~GeV energy range. A wide variety of transient sources have been predicted to emit GeV neutrinos. In light of the upcoming IceCube-Upgrade, which will extend the IceCube detector's sensitivity down to a few GeV, as well as improve its angular resolution, we survey a variety of transient source models and compare their predicted neutrino fluences to detector sensitivities, in particular those of IceCube-DeepCore and the IceCube Upgrade. We consider the ranges of neutrino fluence from transients powered by non-relativistic shocks, such as novae, supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and tidal disruption events. We also consider fast radio bursts and relativistic outflows of high- and low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts. Our study sheds light on the prospects of observing GeV transients with existing and upcoming neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>Radiative cooling changes the dynamics of magnetically arrested disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied magnetically arrested disks (MAD) around rotating black holes (BH), under the influence of radiative cooling. We introduce a critical value of the mass accretion rate $\dot M_{\rm crit}$ for which the cooling by the synchrotron process efficiently radiates the thermal energy of the disk. We find $\dot M_{\rm crit} \approx 10^{-5.5} \dot M_{\rm Edd}$, where $\dot M_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington mass accretion rate. The normalization constant depends on the saturated magnetic flux and on the ratio of electron to proton temperatures, but not on the BH mass. We verify our analytical estimate using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations for a range of black hole spin parameters $a \in \{ -0.94, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.94 \}$ and mass accretion rates ranging from $10^{-7}\dot M_{\rm Edd}$ to $10^{-4}\dot M_{\rm Edd}$. We numerically observe that the MAD parameter and the jet efficiency vary by a factor of $\approx 2$ as the mass accretion rate increases above $\dot M_{\rm crit}$, which confirms our analytical result. We further detail how the forces satisfying the quasi-equilibrium of the disk change, with the magnetic contribution increasing as the thermal contribution decreases.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unusual High-frequency Eclipses in MSP J1908+2105</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the eclipse properties of the spider millisecond pulsar (MSP) J1908$+$2105, using wide-band observations from the uGMRT and Parkes UWL. For the first time, we observed that this pulsar exhibits extended eclipses up to 4 GHz, the highest frequency band of the UWL, making it one of only three MSPs known to have such high-frequency eclipses. This study reveals synchrotron absorption as the primary eclipse mechanism for J1908$+$2105. We present modeling of synchrotron optical depth with various possible combinations of the parameters to explain the observed eclipsing in this as well as other spider MSPs. Observed eclipses at unusually high frequencies for J1908$+$2105 significantly aided in constraining the magnetic field and electron column density in the eclipse medium while modeling the synchrotron optical depth. Combining our findings with data from other MSPs in the literature, for the first time we note that a higher cutoff frequency of eclipsing, particularly above 1 GHz, is consistently associated with a higher electron column density ($&gt;$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) in the eclipse medium. Additionally, we present the first evidence of lensing effects near eclipse boundaries in this MSP, leading to significant magnification of radio emissions. The orbital phase resolved polarization analysis presented in this paper further indicates variation in rotation measure and consequently stronger magnetic fields in the eclipse region.</description>

      <title>PSR J1231-1411 revisited: Pulse Profile Analysis of X-ray Observation</title>

Abstract: One of the primary goals of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)-like X-ray missions is to impose stringent constraints on the neutron star equation of state by precisely measuring their masses and radii. NICER has recently expanded the dataset of inferred mass-radius relations for neutron stars, including four rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437-4715, and PSR J1231-1411. In this work, the mass-radius relation and X-ray emitting region properties of PSR J1231-1411 are inferred with an independent pulse profile modeling based on the spherical star Schwarzschild-spacetime and Doppler approximation. With one single-temperature elongated hot spot and one single-temperature crescent hot spot, the inferred gravitational mass is $M = 1.12 \pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$ and the inferred equatorial radius is $R_{eq} = 9.91_{-0.86}^{+0.88}$ km (68% credible intervals). It provides an alternative geometry configuration of the X-ray emitting region for PSR J1231-1411 to sufficiently explain the observation data of NICER and XMM-Newton. The inferred radius is smaller than that derived by \citet{salmi2024nicer} ($M = 1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05} M_{\odot}$, $R_{eq} = 12.6 \pm 0.3$ km), and the inferred mass is slightly higher in this work. The inferred geometry configurations of the X-ray emitting region in both works are non-antipodal, which is not consistent with a centered dipole magnetic field and suggests a complex magnetic field structure.</description>

      <title>Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) I: Survey description, discovery and timing of the first pulsar in NGC 6093 (M80)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the new Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey. This survey aims to find MSPs in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using uGMRT. The observations use the uGMRT's Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, which are well suited for steep-spectral-index radio sources like MSPs; the survey will eventually cover the GCs accessible to the uGMRT sky (i.e. $\delta\:&gt;\:\sim\:-\:53^\circ$), and that is South of $\delta = -17^\circ$ (FAST sky limit) and have not been targeted with the sensitivity of this survey. The observations started in May 2023, having so far resulted in seven new discoveries. In this paper, we present the discovery and follow-up study of the first pulsar from this survey, J1617$-$2258A, a 4.32 ms binary MSP that is also the first to be discovered in the globular cluster NGC 6093. We localised this MSP with arc-sec precision from imaging and obtained the unique timing solution from more than one year of timing observations with the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) receivers of the uGMRT. This revealed an unusual binary MSP, with a $\sim$ 19-hour, highly eccentric (e $\sim$ 0.54) orbit having a low-mass companion. This orbital eccentricity allowed the measurement of the rate of advance of periastron for this system, which led to the derivation of its total mass, $1.67 \, \pm \, 0.06 \, \rm M_{\odot}$; this together with the system's mass function implies, for the pulsar and the companion, $M_\mathrm{p} &lt; 1.60 \, \rm M_{\odot}$ and $M_\mathrm{c} &gt; 0.072 \, \rm M_{\odot}$. The system is likely a perturbed MSP-Helium WD system seen at a low orbital inclination.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Phase Transition in the xSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}&gt; 10^{-300}$. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PBHs within the xSM framework may align with observations of the six ultrashort timescale events reported by the OGLE microlensing experiment.</description>

      <title>Luminosity predictions for the first three ionisation stages of W, Pt and Au to probe potential sources of emission in kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large number of R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation for heavy elements (Z &gt; 70) have been performed in recent years for applications in fusion and astrophysics research. With the expanding interest in heavy ions due to kilonova (KN) events such as AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi, this new data can be utilised for the diagnosis and study of observed KN spectra. In this work recently computed electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths are used, for the first three ionisation stages of tungsten (W, Z = 74), platinum (Pt, Z = 78) and gold (Au, Z = 79), to construct basic collisional radiative models tailored for the late stage nebular phases of KN. Line luminosities are calculated at a range of electron temperatures and densities and the strengths of these lines for a representative ion mass are compared. For the case of W III, these optically thin intensities are additionally used to constrain the mass of this ion in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. Comparing with theoretical predictions of nucleosynthesis yields from neutron-star merger simulations, broad agreement with the inferred ion masses of W is found. Furthermore, we highlight the value of W measurements by showing that the abundance of other groups of elements and outflow properties are constrained by exploiting theoretically motivated correlations between the abundance of W and that of lanthanides or third r-process peak elements. Based on simple estimates, we also show that constraints on the distribution of tungsten in the ejecta may be accessible through the line shape, which may also yield information on the neutron-star merger remnant evolution.</description>

      <title>Mixed origins: strong natal kicks for some black holes and none for others</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using stellar kinematic data from Gaia DR3, we revisit constraints on black hole (BH) natal kicks from observed accreting and detached BH binaries. We compare the space velocities and Galactic orbits of a sample of 12 BHs in the Galactic disk with well-constrained distances to their local stellar populations, for which we obtain proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia DR3. Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities, because our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and have likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks. Nevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a kick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar populations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local stellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\gtrsim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, 6 BHs have kinematics typical of their local populations, disfavoring kicks of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$. For two BHs, V404 Cyg and VFTS 243, there is strong independent evidence for a very weak kick $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis implies that while some BHs must form with very weak kicks, it would be wrong to conclude that most BHs do, particularly given that selection biases favor weak kicks. Although the uncertainties on most individual BHs' kicks are still too large to assess whether the kick distribution is bimodal, the data are consistent with a scenario where some BHs form by direct collapse and receive weak kicks, and others form in supernovae and receive strong kicks.</description>

      <title>X-raying CAMELS: Constraining Baryonic Feedback in the Circum-Galactic Medium with the CAMELS simulations and eRASS X-ray Observations</title>

Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) around massive galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating star formation and feedback. Using the CAMELS simulation suite, we develop emulators for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the X-ray luminosity--stellar mass scaling relation to investigate how stellar and AGN feedback shape the X-ray properties of the hot CGM. Our analysis shows that at CGM scales ($10^{12} \lesssim M_{\rm halo}/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{13}$, $10\lesssim r/{\rm kpc} \lesssim 400$), stellar feedback more significantly impacts the X-ray properties than AGN feedback within the parameters studied. Comparing the emulators to recent eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations, it was found that stronger feedback than currently implemented in the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid simulations is required to match observed CGM properties. However, adopting these enhanced feedback parameters causes deviations in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relations from observational constraints below the group mass scale. This tension suggests possible unaccounted systematics in X-ray CGM observations or inadequacies in the feedback models of cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Secluded and Catalyzed Annihilation Dark Matter with Fermi-LAT and Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter (DM) model with a complex scalar charged under a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as $U(1)_D$. The scalar field is the DM candidate while the $U(1)_D$ gauge field $A'$ plays the role of a mediator, which connects the dark sector to the standard model (SM) sector via a tiny kinetic mixing. We find that both the secluded and catalyzed annihilation scenarios can be realized in this model. The phenomenology of DM, including relic density, indirect detection (Fermi-LAT), and CMB (Planck) constraints, is discussed. We also extend our discussion to DM with other spins, including Dirac fermion and vector boson. Our analysis is carried out in two models, denoted as $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$, with the former corresponding to $A'$ kinetically mixing with the $U(1)_Y$ gauge field $B$ and the latter corresponding to $A'$ mixing with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge field $Z'$. We find that, in previous studies, the indirect detection limits were overly restrictive because they only considered the simplified $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2\mathrm{SM}$ annihilation channel. In contrast, by performing a complete calculation of the gamma-ray and CMB constraints from the process $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2A' \to 4\mathrm{SM}$ in the models we consider, we observe weaker constraints in both the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ models, with the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model being subject to the weakest constraints overall since it involves less hadronic decay processes.</description>

      <title>Extract cleaned Swift/UVOT UV grism spectra with uvotpy package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultraviolet/optical telescope (UVOT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory is capable of imaging with 7 lenticular filters and of taking slitless spectra with 2 grisms. Both image and grism data have been widely used to study gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and other ultraviolet/optical transients, and proved UVOT is a powerful instrument in time-domain astronomy. However, the second order contamination, for blue sources, strongly limits the red end of ultraviolet (UV) grism spectra. This, in turn, reduces the valid wavelength range to only about 33% of the total. However, to explore the broadband spectral energy distribution of GRBs at the early stage, a larger valid wavelength range is required. Hence based on the uvotpy package, we propose a method to remove the second order contamination from UV grism spectra (nominal mode) up to about 4000\AA, i.e., about 70% of the full wavelength range. The 1-sigma systematic uncertainty of this method is about 11.2%. In addition, if a source is red enough, the red end of the valid range could reach about 5000\AA. The source code is available on GitHub.</description>
