      <title>Metarecycling in Physics Education in Basic Education within the Context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals through Technological Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of digital technologies in the first quarter of the 21st century has introduced significant transformations in various fields, such as communication, healthcare, and education. However, it has also led to an increase in the use and disposal of electronic devices, resulting in environmental challenges related to Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), also known as e-waste. This phenomenon is observed in schools, where the integration and renewal of equipment have become essential for the development and implementation of new teaching strategies. Based on a technological research project, we present how students from a public school in S\~ao Paulo's countryside conducted e-waste reuse processes, applying the principles of metarecycling and physics knowledge to build a portable battery (power bank) and a smartphone charger powered by a dynamo attached to a bicycle. The appropriation of the relationships between science, technology, and social aspects was facilitated by validating the chargers through characterization tests of the charging time provided by the power bank and the bicycle-installed device under riding conditions. Educational actions within the community, involving concepts of sustainability, clean energy, and health benefits through physical exercise, were guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</description>

      <title>Encouraging the teaching of science through composting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of environmental education into the school curriculum can be inspiring for students to assimilate scientific concepts and methods presented in the Science subjects in a contextualized and interdisciplinary way. To carry out such integration in the classroom it is important that a link between teacher training courses and practical activities on the subject during the training of the student teachers exist, to provide them conditions for testing hypotheses, pedagogical methodologies and evaluate their feasibility, considering real limitations of the school environment. The Institutional Program of Scholarships for Teaching Initiation (PIBID - Programa Institucional de Bolsas de Inicia\c{c}\~ao \`a Doc\^encia) is a Brazilian government policy developed to improve the training of student teachers which provides an ideal scenario for this. In this work, students from PIBID carried out this proposal through the windrow composting process. This was developed at the school considering the selective separation of waste, the construction of compost bins, the introduction and discussion of scientific concepts and experimentation, by monitoring the process. In addition to the beneficial experience for the training of student teachers, we show that the proposal is promising for developing student's skills such as scientific literacy and protagonism, and also the establishment of a school composting program.</description>

      <title>Valuing science and the teaching of Physics through theatrical communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific communication inside and outside the classroom is the main means for providing an adequate understanding of how science and technological innovation relate to society. In order to achieve this goal, it is important to explore new didactic instruments for teaching science in general. The intersection between science and arts has contributed to make science accessible, relevant and interesting to diverse audiences with the potential to provide scientific content, significant artistic and entertainment values. Here, we use theatrical communication to value science and the teaching of Physics through an original script of a play in which concepts and phenomena related to astronomy are addressed. Using an artistic and casual language, we adapt the proposed scientific concepts to the contextual and instrumental nature of theater to demonstrate its educational value and its potential to transform science into entertainment. Our proposal allowed students being engaged in a highly motivating and collaborative environment, providing them the opportunity to recognize, analyze and imagine explanations and performances to communicate science to the general public in a creative and alternative way.</description>

      <title>COOL Research DAO Whitepaper -- Towards community-owned astrophysics for everyone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.</description>
