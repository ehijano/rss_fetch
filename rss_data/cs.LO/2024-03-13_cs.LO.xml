      <title>RoboCertProb: Property Specification for Probabilistic RoboChart Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RoboChart is a core notation in the RoboStar framework which brings modern modelling and formal verification technologies into software engineering for robotics. It is a timed and probabilistic domain-specific language for robotics and provides a UML-like architectural and state machine modelling. This work presents RoboCertProb for specifying quantitative properties of probabilistic robotic systems modelled in RoboChart. RoboCertProb's semantics is based on PCTL*. To interpret RoboCertProb over RoboChart models, we give a Markov semantics (DTMCs and MDPs) to RoboChart, derived from its existing transformation semantics to the PRISM language. In addition to property specification, RoboCertProb also entitles us to configure loose constants and unspecified functions and operations in RoboChart models. It allows us to set up environmental inputs to verify reactive probabilistic systems not directly supported in probabilistic model checkers like PRISM because they employ a closed-world assumption. We implement RoboCertProb in an accompanying tool of RoboChart, RoboTool, for specifying properties and automatically generating PRISM properties from them to formally verify RoboChart models using PRISM. We have used it to analyse the behaviour of software controllers for two real robots: an industrial painting robot and an agricultural robot for treating plants with UV lights.</description>

      <title>A bargain for mergesorts (functional pearl) -- How to prove your mergesort correct and stable, almost for free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel characterization of stable mergesort functions using relational parametricity, and show that it implies the correctness of mergesort. As a result, one can prove the correctness of several variations of mergesort (e.g., top-down, bottom-up, tail-recursive, non-tail-recursive, smooth, and non-smooth mergesorts) by proving the characterization property for each variation. To further motivate this work, we show a performance trade-off between tail-recursive and non-tail-recursive mergesorts that (1) the former in call-by-value evaluation avoids using up stack space and is efficient and (2) the latter in call-by-need evaluation is an optimal incremental sort, meaning that it performs only $\mathcal{O}(n + k \log k)$ comparisons to compute the least (or greatest) $k$ items of a list of length $n$. Thanks to our characterization and the parametricity translation, we deduced the correctness results, including stability, of various implementations of mergesort for lists, including highly optimized ones, in the Coq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>A Study on Actions for Atomic Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays there is a large number of non-classical logics, each one best suited for reasoning about some issues in abstract fields, such as linguistics or epistemology, among others. Proving interesting properties for each one of them supposes a big workload for logicians and computer scientists. We want an approach into this problematic that is modular. To adress this issue, the report shows new insights in the construction of Atomic Logics introduced by Guillaume Aucher. Atomic Logics let us represent very general left and right introduction rules and they come along a new kind of rules based on display logics and residuation. A new approach is taken into the definition of Atomic Logics, which is now built on a class of actions for which we prove cut-elimination. We show that some of them are equivalent to Aucher's Atomic Logics and we prove cut-elimination and Craig Interpolation for a class of them. The introduced theory is applied to the non-associative Lambek Calculus throughout the report. It is accompanied by a computer-checked formalisation of the original syntax in the proof assistant Coq.</description>

      <title>Generalized Chevalley criteria in simplicial homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a generalized treatment of (co)cartesian arrows, fibrations, and functors. Compared to the classical conditions, the endpoint inclusions get replaced by arbitrary shape inclusions. Our framework is Riehl--Shulman's simplicial homotopy type theory which supports the development of synthetic internal $(\infty,1)$-category theory.</description>

      <title>Integration in Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurable cones, with linear and measurable functions as morphisms, are a model of intuitionistic linear logic and of call-by-name probabilistic PCF which accommodates ``continuous data types'' such as the real line. So far however, they lacked a major feature to make them a model of more general probabilistic programming languages (notably call-by-value and call-by-push-value languages): a theory of integration for functions whose codomain is a cone, which is the key ingredient for interpreting the sampling programming primitives. The goal of this paper is to develop such a theory: our definition of integrals is an adaptation to cones of Pettis integrals in topological vector spaces. We prove that such integrable cones, with integral-preserving linear maps as morphisms, form a model of Linear Logic for which we develop two exponential comonads: the first based on a notion of stable functions introduced in earlier work and thesecond based on a new notion of integrable analytic function on cones.</description>

      <title>Cardinality and Representation of Stone Relation Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has axiomatised the cardinality operation in relation algebras, which counts the number of edges of an unweighted graph. We generalise the cardinality axioms to Stone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the relationships between various axioms for cardinality. This results in simpler cardinality axioms also for relation algebras. We give sufficient conditions for the representability of Stone relation algebras and for Stone relation algebras to be relation algebras.</description>
