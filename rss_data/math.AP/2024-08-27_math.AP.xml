      <title>Curvature in chemotaxis: A model for ant trail pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new model of chemotaxis motivated by ant trail pattern formation, formulated as a coupled parabolic-parabolic local PDE system, for the population density and the chemical field. The main novelty lies in the transport term of the population density, which depends on the second-order derivatives of the chemical field. This term is derived as an anticipation-reaction steering mechanism of an infinitesimally small ant as its size approaches zero. We establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness for the model, and the propagation of regularity from the initial data. Then, we build a numerical scheme and present various examples that provide hints of trail formation.</description>

      <title>Differences of solutions of implicit Euler schemes with accretive operators on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an upper bound for the difference of two solutions of Euler schemes approximating the Cauchy problem \[\begin{cases} \dot{u}(t) + Au(t) \ni f(t) \quad (t \in [0, T]), \\ u(0) = u^0, \end{cases}\] where $A \subseteq X \times X$ is a quasi-accretive operator on a Banach space $X$, $T &gt; 0$, $f \in L^1(0, T; X)$ and $u^0 \in X$. This upper bound generalizes a result from Kobayashi, who established an upper bound for the problem with $f = 0$. We show, that the upper bound can be used to establish existence and uniqueness of Euler solutions as limits of solutions of Euler schemes as well as regularity of Euler solutions.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stochastic entropy solution for degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations with Levy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the well-posedness theory for renormalized entropy solutions of a degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic PDE perturbed by a multiplicative Levy noise with general L1-data on the unbounded domain. By using a suitable approximation procedure based on the vanishing viscosity technique and bounded data, we prove the existence of a renormalized entropy solution to the underlying problem. The uniqueness of the solution is settled by adapting Kru\v{z}kov's doubling the variables technique in the presence of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for a degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic PDE perturbed by Levy noise. In particular, we develop the well-posedness theory of entropy solution based on the Kru\v{z}kov's semi-entropy formulation. In comparison to the pioneered work by Bauzet et al. (J. Funct. Anal. 266, (2014), 2503-2545), concerning the existence and uniqueness of entropy solution for the Dirichlet problem for conservation laws driven by Brownian noise, our present analysis involves a simpler approach to obtain the global Kato's inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations having a singular reaction term with inverse quadratic potential and an absorbing superlinear term of p-power type. We consider equations posed in punctured balls centered at the origin, and we prove that all radial solutions are singular around the origin, by providing a complete classification in dependence of p of their asymptotic behavior near the singularity.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser embeddings for symmetric functions without boundary conditions on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding theorems for symmetric functions without zero boundary condition have been studied on flat Riemannian manifolds, such as the Euclidean space. However, these theorems have only been established on hyperbolic spaces for functions with zero boundary condition. In this work, we focus on sharp Sobolev and Adams-Trudinger-Moser embeddings for radial functions in hyperbolic spaces, considering both bounded and unbounded domains. One of the main features of our approach is that we do not assume boundary zero condition for symmetric functions on geodesic balls or the entire hyperbolic space. Our main results include Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, which establish weighted Sobolev embedding theorems, and Theorems 1.5 together with 1.6, which present Adams-Trudinger-Moser type of embedding theorems. In particular, a key result is Theorem 1.1 which is a highly nontrivial comparison result between norms of the higher order covariant derivatives and higher order derivatives of the radial functions. Higher order asymptotic behavior of radial functions on hyperbolic spaces are established to prove our main theorems. This approach includes novel radial lemmata and decay properties of higher order radial Sobolev functions defined in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Some properties on the reversibility and the linear response theory of Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear response theory is a fundamental framework studying the macroscopic response of a physical system to an external perturbation. This paper focuses on the rigorous mathematical justification of linear response theory for Langevin dynamics. We give some equivalent characterizations for reversible overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics, which is the unperturbed reference system. Then we clarify sufficient conditions for the smoothness and exponential convergence to the invariant measure for the overdamped case. We also clarify those sufficient conditions for the underdamped case, which corresponds to hypoellipticity and hypocoercivity. Based on these, the asymptotic dependence of the response function on the small perturbation is proved in both finite and infinite time horizons. As applications, Green-Kubo relations and linear response theory for a generalized Langevin dynamics are also proved in a rigorous fashion.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann equation in the homogeneous critical regularity framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unique global solution to the Cauchy problem of the 3D Boltzmann equation for initial data around the Maxwellian in the spatially critical homogeneous Besov space $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,1}^{1/2}\cap\dot{B}_{2,1}^{3/2})$. In addition, under the condition that the low-frequency part of initial perturbation is bounded in $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,\infty}^{\sigma_{0}})$ with $-3/2\leq\sigma_{0}&lt;1/2$, it is shown that the solution converges to its equilibrium in large times with the optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\sigma-\sigma_{0})/2})$ in $\widetilde{L}^2_{\xi}(\dot{B}_{2,1}^{\sigma})$ with some $\sigma&gt;\sigma_0$, and the microscopic part decays at an enhanced rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\sigma-\sigma_{0})/2-1/2})$. In contrast to [19], the usual $L^2$ estimates are not necessary in our approach, which provides a new understanding of hypocoercivity theory for the Boltzmann equation allowing to construct the Lyapunov functional with different dissipation rates at low and high frequencies. Furthermore, a time-weighted Lyapunov energy argument can be developed to deduce the optimal time-decay estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inverse problem of determining the Winkler coefficient in a nanoplate resting on an elastic foundation and clamped at the boundary. The nanoplate is described within a simplified strain gradient elasticity theory for isotropic materials, under the Kirchhoff-Love kinematic assumptions in infinitesimal deformation. We prove a global H\"older stability estimate of the subgrade coefficient by performing a single interior measurement of the transverse deflection of the nanoplate induced by a load concentrated at one point.</description>

      <title>Sharper L^1-convergence rates of weak entropy solutions to damped compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of compressible isentropic flow when the initial mass is finite, which is modeled by the compressible Euler equation with frictional damping. It is shown in \cite{HUA} (resp.\cite{GEN}) that any $L^{\infty}$ weak entropy solution of damped compressible Euler equation converges to the Barenblatt solution with finite mass in $L^1$ norm, with convergence rates depending on the adiabatic gas exponent $\gamma$ in the case of $1&lt;\gamma&lt;3$ (resp.$\gamma\ge2$). Whether or not these convergence rates can be improved remains an interesting and challenging open question. In this paper, we obtain a better $L^1$ convergence rate than that in \cite{GEN}, for any $\gamma\ge2$, through a new perspective on the relationship between the density function and the Barenblatt solution of the porous medium equation. Furthermore, making intensive analysis of some relevant convex functions, we are able to obtain the same form of $L^1$ convergence rate for $1&lt;\gamma&lt;9/7$, which is better than that in \cite{HUA} as well.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional wave kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although wave kinetic equations have been rigorously derived in dimension $d \geq 2$, both the physical and mathematical theory of wave turbulence in dimension $d = 1$ is less understood. Here, we look at the one-dimensional MMT (Majda, McLaughlin, and Tabak) model on a large interval of length $L$ with nonlinearity of size $\alpha$, restricting to the case where there are no derivatives in the nonlinearity. The dispersion relation here is $|k|^\sigma$ for $0 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$ and $\sigma \neq 1$, and when $\sigma = 2$, the MMT model specializes to the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. In the range of $1 &lt; \sigma \leq 2$, the proposed collision kernel in the kinetic equation is trivial, begging the question of what is the appropriate kinetic theory in that setting. In this paper we study the kinetic limit $L \to \infty$ and $\alpha \to 0$ under various scaling laws $\alpha \sim L^{-\gamma}$ and exhibit the wave kinetic equation up to timescales $T \sim L^{-\epsilon}\alpha^{-\frac{5}{4}}$ (or $T \sim L^{-\epsilon} T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{\frac{5}{8}}$). In the case of a trivial collision kernel, our result implies there can be no nontrivial dynamics of the second moment up to timescales $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Asymptotic Stability of Blasius Profile in the Steady Prandtl Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an asymptotic stability result concerning the self-similar Blasius profiles $[\bar{u}, \bar{v}]$ of the stationary Prandtl boundary layer equation. Initially demonstrated by Serrin \cite{MR0282585}, the profiles $[\bar{u}, \bar{v}]$ were shown to act as a self-similar attractor of solutions $[u, v]$ to the Prandtl equation through the use of von Mises transform and maximal principle techniques. Specifically, as $x \to \infty$, $\|u - \bar{u}\|_{L^{\infty}_{y}} \to 0$. Iyer \cite{MR4097332} employed refined energy methods to derive an explicit convergence rate for initial data close to Blasius. Wang and Zhang \cite{MR4657422} utilized barrier function methods, removing smallness assumptions but imposing stronger asymptotic conditions on the initial data. It was suggested that the optimal convergence rate should be $\|u-\bar{u}\|_{L^{\infty}_{y}}\lesssim (x+1)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, treating the stationary Prandtl equation as a 1-D parabolic equation in the entire space.
  In this study, we establish that $\|u - \bar{u}\|_{L^{\infty}_{y}} \lesssim (x+1)^{-1}$. Our proof relies on discovering nearly conserved low-frequency quantities and inherent degenerate structures at the boundary, which enhance the convergence rate through iteration techniques. Notably, the convergence rate we have demonstrated is optimal. We can find special solutions of Prandtl's equation such that the convergence between the solutions and the Blasius profile is exact, represented as $ (x+1)^{-1} $.</description>

      <title>High Order Smoothness for Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations with Transport and Stretching Noise on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain energy estimates for a transport and stretching noise under Leray Projection on a 2D bounded convex domain, in Sobolev Spaces of arbitrarily high order. The estimates are taken in equivalent inner products, defined through powers of the Stokes Operator with a specific choice of Navier boundary conditions. We exploit fine properties of the noise in relation to the Stokes Operator to achieve cancellation of derivatives in the presence of the Leray Projector. As a result, we achieve an additional degree of regularity in the corresponding Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation to attain a true strong solution of the original Stratonovich equation. Furthermore for any order of smoothness, we can construct a strong solution of a hyperdissipative version of the Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation with the given regularity; hyperdissipation is only required to control the nonlinear term in the presence of a boundary. We supplement the result by obtaining smoothness without hyperdissipation on the torus, in 2D and 3D on the lifetime of solutions.</description>

      <title>Optical Inversion Using Plasmonic Contrast Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a new method to reconstruct the permittivity distribution, of an object to image, from the remotely measured electromagnetic field. We propose to use the remote fields measured before and after injecting locally in the medium plasmonic nano-particles. Such a technique is known in the framework of imaging using contrast agents where, in optical imaging, the nano-particles play the role of these contrast agents. The plasmonic nano-particles are known to enjoy resonant effects, as enhancing the applied incident field, while excited at certain particular frequencies called plasmonic resonances. These resonant frequencies encode the values of the unknown permittivity at the location of the injected nano-particles. The imaging methods we propose mainly use this resonant effect. We show that the imaging functional build up from contrasting the fields before and after injecting the nano-particles, measured at one single back-scattered direction, and in an explicit band of incident frequencies reaches its maximum values, in terms of the incident frequency, precisely at the mentioned plasmonic resonances. Such a behavior allows us to recover these plasmonic resonances from which we recover the point-wise values of the permittivity distribution.
  In this work, we describe the method and provide the mathematical justification of this resonant effect and its use for the optical inversion using plasmonic nano-particles as contrast agents.</description>

      <title>Criterion of singularity formation for radial solutions of the pressureless Euler-Poisson equations in exceptional dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial dimensions 1 and 4 play an exceptional role for radial solutions of the pressureless repulsive Euler-Poisson equations. Namely, for any spatial dimension except 1 and 4, any nontrivial solution of the Cauchy problem blows up in a finite time (except in special cases), whereas for dimensions 1 and 4 there exists a neighborhood of trivial initial data in the $C^1$ - norm such that the respective solution preserves the initial smoothness globally. For dimension 1, the criterion of the singularity formation in terms of initial data was known, i.e. this neighborhood can be found exactly.
  For the case of dimension 4, there was no similar result. In this paper, we close this gap and obtain such a criterion for the case of a more technically complicated case of dimension 4.</description>

      <title>A fully nonlinear locally constrained curvature flow for capillary hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a locally constrained fully nonlinear curvature flow for convex capillary hypersurfaces in half-space. We prove that the flow preserves the convexity, exists for all time, and converges smoothly to a spherical cap. This can be viewed as the fully nonlinear counterpart of the result in \cite{MWW}. As a byproduct, a high-order capillary isoperimetric ratio (1.6) evolves monotonically along this flow, which yields a class of the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Runge approximation for nonlocal wave equations and unique determination of polyhomogeneous nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13869v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to establish the Runge-type approximation in $L^2(0,T;\widetilde{H}^s(\Omega))$ for solutions of linear nonlocal wave equations. To achieve this, we extend the theory of very weak solutions for classical wave equations to our nonlocal framework. This strengthened Runge approximation property allows us to extend the existing uniqueness results for Calder\'on problems of linear and nonlinear nonlocal wave equations in our earlier works. Furthermore, we prove unique determination results for the Calder\'on problem of nonlocal wave equations with polyhomogeneous nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to the convergence problem for periodic dispersive equations with a polynomial symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of Carleson's convergence problem for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation $i\, \partial_t u + (-\Delta)^{a/2}u=0$ with $a &gt; 1$ in $\mathbb R^d$, which has Fourier symbol $P(\xi) = |\xi|^a$, it is known that the Sobolev exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is sufficient, but it is not known whether this condition is necessary. In this article, we show that in the periodic problem in $\mathbb T^d$ the exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is necessary for all non-singular polynomial symbols $P$ regardless of the degree of $P$. Among the differential operators covered, we highlight the natural powers of the Laplacian $\Delta^k$ for $k \in \mathbb N$.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the optimal constant of the Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequality on $ RP^{d-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove upper and lower bounds on the optimal constant $\Lambda_d$ of the Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion for positive symmetric functions on the unit sphere $S^{d-1}$, which also can be identified as positive functions on the real projective space $RP^{d-1}$. The Bakry-\'Emery $\Gamma_2$ criterion inequality was crucially used to prove the monotonicty of the Fisher information for the Landau equation by Guillen and Silvestre recently. Therefore, a better bound on the optimal constant $\Lambda_d$ expands the range of interaction potentials that exhibits the monotonicity of the Fisher information. In particular, we compute that $\Lambda_3$ is between $5.5$ and $5.739$.</description>

      <title>On the Loss and Propagation of Modulus of Continuity for the Two-Dimensional Incompressible Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known from the work of Koch that the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations propagate Dini modulus of continuity for the vorticity. In this work, we consider the two-dimensional Euler equations with a modulus of continuity for vorticity rougher than Dini continuous. We first show that the two-dimensional Euler equations propagate an explicit family of moduli of continuity for the vorticity that are rougher than Dini continuity. The main goal of this work is to address the following question: Given a modulus of continuity for the 2D Euler equations, can we always propagate it? The answer to this question is \textit{No}. We construct a family of moduli of continuity for the 2D Euler equations that are \textit{not} propagated.</description>

      <title>Sharp critical mass criteria for weak solutions to a degenerate cross-attraction system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The qualitative study of solutions to the coupled parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with nonlinear diffusion for two species will be considered in the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq 3$). It was proven in \cite{CK2021-ANA} that there exist two critical curves that separate the global existence and blow-up of weak solutions to the above problem. We improve this result by providing sharp criteria for the dicothomy: global existence of weak solution versus blow-up below and at these curves. Besides, there exist sharp critical masses of initial data at the intersection of the two critical lines, which extend the well-known critical mass phenomenon in one-species Keller-Segel system in \cite{BCL09-CVPDE} to two-species case.</description>

      <title>A general theory for the $(s, p)$-superposition of nonlinear fractional operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the continuous superposition of operators of the form \[ \iint_{[0, 1]\times (1, N)} (-\Delta)_p^s \,u\,d\mu(s,p), \] where $\mu$ denotes a signed measure over the set $[0, 1]\times (1, N)$, joined to a nonlinearity satisfying a proper subcritical growth. The novelty of the paper relies in the fact that, differently from the existing literature, the superposition occurs in both $s$ and $p$.
  Here we introduce a new framework which is so broad to include, for example, the scenarios of the finite sum of different (in both $s$ and $p$) Laplacians, or of a fractional $p$-Laplacian plus a $p$-Laplacian, or even combinations involving some fractional Laplacians with the "wrong" sign.
  The development of this new setting comes with two applications, which are related to the Weierstrass Theorem and a Mountain Pass technique. The results obtained contribute to the existing literature with several specific cases of interest which are entirely new.</description>

      <title>Towards a computational framework using finite element methods with Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach for swimmers with contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swimming involves a body's capability to navigate through a fluid by undergoing self-deformations. Typically, fluid dynamics are described by the Navier-Stokes equations, and when integrated with a swimming body, it results in a highly intricate model. This paper introduces a computational framework for simulating the movement of multiple swimmers with various geometries immersed in a Navier-Stokes fluid. The approach relies on the finite element method with an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework to handle swimmer displacements. Numerous numerical experiments demonstrate the adaptability of the computational framework across various scenarios.All the implementations are made using the Feel++ finite element library.</description>

      <title>Global existence and time decay of strong solutions to a fluid-particle coupled model with energy exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a three-dimensional fluid-particle coupled model. % in whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. This model combines the full compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation via the momentum and energy exchanges. We obtain the global existence and optimal time decay rates of strong solutions to the model in whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$ when the initial data are a small perturbation of the given equilibrium in $H^2$. We show that the $L^2$-norms of the solutions and their gradients decay as $(1+t)^{-3/4}$ and $(1+t)^{-5/4}$ respectively. Moreover, we also obtain the decay rates of solutions in $L^p$-norms for $p\in [2,\infty]$, and the optimal time decay rates of the highest-order derivatives of strong solutions which reads as $(1+t)^{-{7}/{4}}$ in $L^2$-norm. % Our decay rates are consistent with those of non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. When the model is considered in a periodic domain, besides the global existence results, we show the strong solution decay exponentially. Our proofs rely on the energy method,
  Fourier analysis techniques, and the method of frequency decomposition. And some new ideas are introduced to achieve the desired convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Global uniform regularity for the 3D incompressible MHD equations with slip boundary condition near an equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper solves the global conormal regularity problem for the three-dimensional incompressible MHD equations with slip boundary condition near a background magnetic field. Motivated by applications in geophysics, the MHD system considered here is anisotropic with small vertical dissipation and small horizontal magnetic diffusion. By exploiting the enhanced dissipation due to the background magnetic field and introducing three layers of energy functionals, we are able to establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are independent of vertical viscosity and horizontal resistivity. These global conormal regularity estimates allow us to pass to the limit and obtain the convergence to the MHD system with no vertical dissipation and horizontal magnetic diffusion. In the special case of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes, explicit long-time rates are also extracted in the zero vertical viscosity limit. This result complements the important work of Xiao and Xin \cite{Xiao2007,Xiao2013}.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and decay rates of strong solutions to the incompressible Vlasov-MHD system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global well-posedness and decay rates of strong solutions to an incompressible Vlasov-MHD model arising in magnetized plasmas. This model is consist of the Vlasov equation and the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations which interacts together via the Lorentz forces. It is readily to verify that it has two equilibria $(\bar f,\bar u,\bar B)=(0,0,0)$ and $( \tilde f,\tilde u,\tilde B)=(M,0,0)$, where $M$ is the global maxwellian. For each equilibrium, assuming that the $H^2$ norm of the initial data $(f_0,B_0,U_0)$ is sufficient small and $f_0(x,v)$ has a compact support in the position $x$ and the velocity $v$, we construct the global well-posedness and decay rates of strong solutions near the equilibrium in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. And the solution decays polynomially. The global existence result still holds for the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ case without the compact support assumption in $x$. In addition, the decay rates are exponential. Lack of dissipation structure in the Vlasov equation and the strong trilinear coupling term $((u-v)\times B)f$ in the model are two main impediments in obtaining our results. To surround these difficulties, we assume that $f_0(x,v)$ has a compact support and utilize the method of characteristics to calculate the size of the supports of $f$. Thus, we overcome the difficulty in estimating the integration $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \big((u-v)\times B\big)f\mathrm{d}v$ and obtain the global existence of strong solutions by taking advantage of a refined energy method. Moreover, by making full use of the Fourier techniques, we obtain the optimal time decay rate of the gradient of the solutions. This is the first result on strong solutions to the Vlasov-MHD model containing nonlinear Lorentz forces.</description>

      <title>Radial 3D Focusing Energy Critical INLS equation with a sub-critical perturbation: Ground states, Blow-up, and scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a 3D nonlinear focusing Schr\"odinger equations with perturbed energy critical inhomogeneous non-linearity in the radial regime,
  $$
  i \partial_t u +\Delta u =|x|^{-a} |u|^{p-2} u - |x|^{-b} |u|^{4-2b}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}_x^3, $$ where $0&lt;a$, $b&lt;2$ and $2+\frac{4-2a}{3}\leq p\leq 6-2a$. First, we prove the existence/nonexistence of ground states. Subsequently, we establish the scattering versus blowup below the ground-state energy threshold. Our methodology hinges on Tao's scattering criterion and Dodson-Murphy's Virial/Morawetz inequalities.
  An intriguing aspect of our study is the absence of scaling invariance within the equation, attributed to the interplay of competing nonlinearities. Moreover, the presence of singular weights serves as a barrier to translation invariance in the spatial variable, adding more complexity to the analysis.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the inaugural exploration of the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a leading-order focusing energy critical nonlinearity and a defocusing perturbation.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the consumption chemotaxis problem
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases*}
  u_t = \Delta u - \chi \nabla \cdot u\nabla v + \lambda u - \mu u^2 - c \lvert \nabla u \rvert^\gamma, &amp; \text{in $\Omega\times(0,\tmax)$},
  v_t = \Delta v - uv, &amp; \text{in $\Omega\times(0,\tmax)$},
  \end{cases*} \end{equation*} in a bounded and smooth domain $\Omega\subset\R^n$, $n\geq 3$, under Neumann boundary conditions, for $\chi,\lambda,\mu,c&gt;0$, $\tmax\in(0,\infty]$ and for $u_0,v_0$ positive initial data with a certain regularity. We will show that the problem has a unique and uniformly bounded classical solution for $\gamma\in\bigl(\frac{2n}{n+1},2\bigr]$. Moreover, we have the same result for $\gamma=\frac{2n}{n+1}$ and a condition that involves the parameters $c,\mu,n,\chi$ and the initial data.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for Laplace operator in a bounded domain with periodic perforation in the case of small volume. We obtain the optimal quantitative error estimates independent of the spectral gaps for an asymptotic expansion, with two leading terms, of Dirichlet eigenvalues. We also establish the convergence rates for the corresponding eigenfunctions. Our approach uses a known reduction to a degenerate elliptic eigenvalue problem for which a quantitative analysis is carried out.</description>

      <title>Volume-preserving mean-curvature flow as a singular limit of a diffusion-aggregation equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Patlak-Keller-Segel system of equations (PKS) is a classical example of aggregation-diffusion equation in which the repulsive effect of diffusion is in competition with the attractive chemotaxis term. Recent work on the Parabolic-Elliptic PKS model have shown that when the repulsion is modeled by a nonlinear diffusion term $\rho \nabla \rho^{m-1}$ with $m&gt;2$, this competition leads to phase separation phenomena. Furthermore, in some asymptotic regime corresponding to a large population observed over a long enough time, the interface separating regions of high and low density evolves according to the Hele-Shaw free boundary problem with surface tension. In the present paper, we consider the counterpart of that model, namely the Elliptic-Parabolic PKS model and we prove that the same phase separation phenomena occurs, but the motion of the interface is now described (asymptotically) by a volume-preserving mean-curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Variational Approach for the Singular Perturbation Domain Wall System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study a coupled system of differential equations with Allen-Cahn type non-linearity. Motivated by physical phenomena one of the unknowns in the system is accompanied by a singular perturbation parameter {\epsilon}^2 . By employing variational techniques, we establish the existence of solutions for all values of {\epsilon} and get results on their qualitative properties, including regularity. Additionally, we analyse the behaviour of solutions as {\epsilon} {\to} 0, demonstrating their pointwise convergence to the solution of the problem for {\epsilon} = 0. We establish the uniqueness of this solution modulo translations. Additionally, in the final section, through an appropriate change of scale, we relate this problem and the second Painlev\'e equation.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operators on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions related to compact operators on manifolds. Firstly, we present the suitable bound of $\int_{a\leq|s|\leq b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a\geq0,b&gt;0),$ $\int_{a\leq s\leq b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},\gamma\neq0,a,b\in \mathbb{R})$ and $\int_{0\leq|s|&lt; +\infty}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds(\gamma \in \mathbb{R})$, which extends the result of Page 204 of Vega (199-211,IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 42, 1992.) Secondly, we prove that $\left|\gamma\int_{a}^{b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds\right|\leq C(1+|\gamma|)^{2}(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a,b\in \mathbb{R}),$ where $C$ is independent of $\gamma,a, b$, which extends Lemma 1 of Bez et al. (Forum of Mathematics, Sigma, 9(2021), 1-52). Thirdly, we extend the result of Theorems 8, 9 of R. Frank, J. Sabin (Amer. J. Math. 139(2017), 1649-1691.) with the aid of the suitable bound of the above complex integrals established in this paper. Fourthly, we establish the Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions related to Boussinesq operator on the real line for both small time interval and large time interval and on the torus with small time interval; we also establish the convergence result of some compact operators in Schatten norm. Fifthly, we establish the convergence result related to nonlinear part of the solution to some operator equations in Schatten spaces. Finally, inspired by the work of Hadama and Yamamoto (Probabilistic Strichartz estimates in Schatten classes and their applications to Hartree equation, arxiv:2311.02713v1.), for $\gamma_{0}\in \mathfrak{S}^{2}$, we establish the probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operator on manifolds with full randomization, which improves the result of Corollary 1.2 of Bez et al. (Selecta Math. 26(2020), 24 pp) in the probabilistic sense.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores key aspects of the theory and applications of conformable fractional order systems. It begins by establishing the existence and uniqueness of the evolution operator for a class of non-autonomous homogeneous systems. Using the Schauder fixed point theorem and the theory of linear evolution systems, we delve into the existence of mild solutions for a class of non-autonomous conformable fractional semi-linear systems. Additionally, the paper addresses the exact null controllability of abstract systems. We present an example to demonstrate the efficiency of the results.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Regularization for 3D Multi-Species Tumor Growth Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-species partial differential equation (PDE) model for tumor growth and a an algorithm for calibrating the model from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The model is designed for glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors. The modeled species correspond to proliferative, infiltrative, and necrotic tumor cells. The model calibration is formulated as an inverse problem and solved a PDE-constrained optimization method. The data that drives the calibration is derived by a single multi-parametric MRI image. This a typical clinical scenario for GBMs. The unknown parameters that need to be calibrated from data include ten scalar parameters and the infinite dimensional initial condition (IC) for proliferative tumor cells. This inverse problem is highly ill-posed as we try to calibrate a nonlinear dynamical system from data taken at a single time. To address this ill-posedness, we split the inversion into two stages. First we regularize the IC reconstruction by solving a single-species compressed sensing problem. Then, using the IC reconstruction, we invert for model parameters using a weighted regularization term. We construct the regularization term by using auxiliary 1D inverse problems. We apply our proposed scheme to clinical data. We compare our algorithm with single-species reconstruction and unregularized reconstructions. Our scheme enables the stable estimation of non-observable species and quantification of infiltrative tumor cells.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new families of four-dimensional Ricci solitons of cohomogeneity two with volume collapsing ends. In a local presentation of the metric conformal to a product, we reduce the soliton equation to a degenerate Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for the conformal factor coupled with ODEs. We obtain explicit complete expanding solitons as well as abstract existence results for shrinking and steady solitons with boundary. These families of Ricci solitons specialize to classical examples of Einstein and soliton metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10071v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional steady periodic gravity waves on water of finite depth with a prescribed but arbitrary vorticity distribution. The water surface is allowed to be overhanging and no assumptions regarding the absence of stagnation points and critical layers are made. Using conformal mappings and a new reformulation of Bernoulli's equation, we uncover an equivalent formulation as "identity plus compact," which is amenable to Rabinowitz's global bifurcation theorem. This allows us to construct a global connected set of solutions, bifurcating from laminar flows with a flat surface. Moreover, a nodal analysis is carried out for these solutions under a certain spectral assumption involving the vorticity function. Lastly, downstream waves are investigated in more detail.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for a 2D chemotaxis-fluid system with large measures as initial density and vorticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a chemotaxis-fluid system in the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ which describes the motion of bacteria suspended in a Navier-Stokes fluid and attracted by a chemical (oxygen). Employing the vorticity formulation for the fluid equations, we obtain local and global solutions with large (Radon) measures as initial data for the bacterial density and vorticity. The gravitational/centrifugal potential is taken with finite $L^{2}$-gradient that can be large. The uniqueness property is also discussed. For the global result, we need to assume a smallness condition only on the $L^{\infty}$-norm of the initial oxygen concentration. In comparison with previous works, our results provide a new class for the initial density and vorticity, as well as for the potential, covering particularly singular measures such as Dirac delta, measure concentrated on smooth curves (filaments and rings), among others. For that, we approach the system via critical functional spaces, Kato-type norms, and suitable $L^{p}$-estimates uniformly in time.</description>

Abstract: Following Parisi \&amp; Wu's paradigm of stochastic quantization, we constructed in \cite{BDFT} a $\Phi^4$ measure on an arbitrary closed, compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $3$ as an invariant measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. This solves a longstanding open problem in quantum fields on curved backgrounds. In the present work, we build all the harmonic and microlocal analysis tools that are needed in \cite{BDFT}. In particular, we extend the approach of Jagannath--Perkowski to the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model by introducing a new Cole-Hopf transform involving random bundle maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove some abstract multiplicity theorems that can be used to obtain multiple nontrivial solutions of critical growth $p$-Laplacian and $(p,q)$-Laplacian type problems. We show that the problems considered here have arbitrarily many solutions for all sufficiently large values of a certain parameter $\lambda &gt; 0$. In particular, the number of solutions goes to infinity as $\lambda \to \infty$. Moreover, we give an explicit lower bound on $\lambda$ in order to have a given number of solutions. This lower bound is in terms of a sequence of eigenvalues constructed using the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-cohomological index. This is a consequence of the fact that our abstract multiplicity results make essential use of the piercing property of the cohomological index, which is not shared by the genus. Our result for the $p$-Laplacian is new even in the semilinear case $p = 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $u_s$ denote a solution of the fractional Poisson problem $$
  (-\Delta)^s u_s = f\quad\text{ in }\Omega,\qquad u_s=0\quad \text{ on }\mathbb{R}^N\setminus \Omega, $$ where $N\geq 2$ and $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain of class $C^2$. We show that the solution mapping $s\mapsto u_s$ is differentiable in $L^\infty(\Omega)$ at $s=1$, namely, at the nonlocal-to-local transition. Moreover, using the logarithmic Laplacian, we characterize the derivative $\partial_s u_s$ as the solution to a boundary value problem. This complements the previously known differentiability results for $s$ in the open interval $(0,1)$. Our proofs are based on an asymptotic analysis to describe the collapse of the nonlocality of the fractional Laplacian as $s$ approaches 1. We also provide a new representation of $\partial_s u_s$ for $s \in (0,1)$ which allows us to refine previously obtained Green function estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study steady axisymmetric water waves with general vorticity and swirl, subject to the influence of surface tension. Explicit solutions to such a water wave problem are static configurations where the surface is an unduloid, that is, a periodic surface of revolution with constant mean curvature. We prove that to any such configuration there connects a global continuum of non-static solutions by means of a global implicit function theorem. To prove this, the key is strict monotonicity of a certain function describing the mean curvature of an unduloid and involving complete elliptic integrals. From this point of view, this paper is an interesting interplay between water waves, geometry, and properties of elliptic integrals.</description>

Abstract: In 1996 Seo proved that two appropriate pairs of current and voltage data measured on the surface of a planar homogeneous object are sufficient to determine a conductive polygonal inclusion with known deviating conductivity. Here we show that the corresponding linearized forward map is injective, and from this we deduce Lipschitz stability of the solution of the original nonlinear inverse problem. We also treat the case of an insulating polygonal inclusion, in which case a single pair of Cauchy data is already sufficient for the same purpose.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence of weak solutions to a diffuse interface model describing the flow of a fluid through a deformable porous medium consisting of two phases. The system non-linearly couples Biot's equations for poroelasticity, including phase-field dependent material properties, with the Cahn-Hilliard equation to model the evolution of the solid, and is further augmented by a visco-elastic regularization of Kelvin-Voigt type. To obtain this result, we approximate the problem in two steps, where first a semi-Galerkin ansatz is employed to show existence of weak solutions to regularized systems, for which later on compactness arguments allow limit passage. Notably, we also establish a maximal regularity theory for linear visco-elastic problems.</description>

Abstract: Triggered by a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [17], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

Abstract: We study the copolynomials of $n$ variables, i.e. $K$-linear mappings from the ring of polynomials $K[x_1,...,x_n]$ into the commutative ring $K$.
  We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for a linear differential equation of infinite order which can be considered as an algebraic version of the classical Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem for the existence of the fundamental solution of a linear differential operator with constant coefficients. We find the fundamental solutions of linear differential operators of infinite order and show that the unique solution of the corresponding inhomogeneous equation can be represented as a convolution of the fundamental solution of this operator and the right-hand side. We also prove the existence and uniqueness theorem of the Cauchy problem for some linear differential equations in the module of formal power series with copolynomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>Constructive Krein-Rutman result for Kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in a domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general Kinetic Fokker-Planck (KFP) equation in a domain with Maxwell reflection condition on the boundary, not necessarily with conservation of mass. We establish the wellposedness in many spaces including Radon measures spaces, and in particular the existence and uniqueness of fundamental solutions. We also establish a Krein-Rutman theorem with constructive rate of convergence in an abstract setting that we use for proving that the solutions to the KFP equation converge toward the conveniently normalized first eigenfunction. Both results use the ultracontractivity of the associated semigroup in a fundamental way.</description>

      <title>Partial gradient regularity for parabolic systems with degenerate diffusion and H\"older continuous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider vector valued weak solutions $u:\Omega_T\to \mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\in \mathbb{N}$ of degenerate or singular parabolic systems of type \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u - \mathrm{div} \, a(z,u,Du) = 0 \qquad\text{in}\qquad \Omega_T= \Omega\times (0,T), \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ denotes an open set in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq 1$ and $T&gt;0$ a finite time. Assuming that the vector field $a$ is not of Uhlenbeck-type structure, satisfies $p$-growth assumptions and $(z,u)\mapsto a(z,u,\xi)$ is H\"older continuous for every $\xi\in \mathbb{R}^{Nn}$, we show that the gradient $Du$ is partially H\"older continuous, provided the vector field degenerates like that of the $p$-Laplacian for small gradients.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of a 2x2 Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance System with Varying Generalized Chaplygin Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of two balance laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with varying generalized Chaplygin gas, which exhibits negative pressure and is a product of a function of time and the inverse of a power of the density. The Chaplygin gas is a fluid designed to accommodate measurements for the early universe and late-time universal expansion while obeying the pressure-density-time relation. We produce an explanation and description of the non-self-similar Riemann solutions, including the non-classical singular solutions. We also find that due to a direct dependence on time, a change in the regions allowing for combinations of classical and non-classical singular solutions occurs, therefore a Riemann solution can have different solutions over several time intervals. Our findings are confirmed numerically using the local Lax-Friederichs scheme.</description>

      <title>Global Existence of Large Strong Solutions to the 3D Full Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Density-dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate the Cauchy problem of global in time existence of large strong solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous compressible and heat conducting fluids. A class of density-dependent viscosity is considered. By introducing the modified effective viscous flux and using the bootstrap argument, we establish the global existence of large strong solutions when the initial density is linearly equivalent to a large constant state. It should be mentioned that this result is obtained without any restrictions on the size of initial velocity and initial temperature.</description>

      <title>On the nonexistence of NLS breathers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a rigorous proof of the nonexistence of breather solutions for NLS equations is presented. By using suitable virial functionals, we are able to characterize the nonexistence of breather solutions, different from standing waves, by only using their inner energy and the power of the corresponding nonlinearity of the equation. We extend this result for several NLS models with different power nonlinearities and even the derivative and logarithmic NLS equations.</description>

      <title>Solving Schiffer's problem in inverse scattering theory almost surely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a probabilistic perspective on the Schiffer's problem in the inverse scattering theory, which asks whether one can uniquely determine the shape of an unknown obstacle by a single far-field measurement. It is a longstanding problem and has received considerable studies in the literature. We show that this conjecture holds true in more general settings in the probability sense. Our new perspective has important implications from the practical viewpoint and also points an interesting direction of research for broader inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Violent nonlinear collapse in the interior of charged hairy black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new one-parameter family indexed by $\epsilon$ of two-ended, spatially-homogeneous black hole interiors solving the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations with a (possibly zero) cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and bifurcating off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(dS/AdS) interior ($\epsilon = 0$). For all small $\epsilon \neq 0$, we prove that, although the black hole is charged, its terminal boundary is an everywhere-spacelike Kasner singularity foliated by spheres of zero radius $r$.
  Moreover, smaller perturbations (i.e. smaller $|\epsilon|$) are more singular than larger one, in the sense that the Hawking mass and the curvature blow up following a power law of the form $r^{-O(\epsilon^{-2})}$ at the singularity $\{r=0\}$. This unusual property originates from a dynamical phenomenon -- violent nonlinear collapse -- caused by the almost formation of a Cauchy horizon to the past of the spacelike singularity $\{r=0\}$. This phenomenon was previously described numerically in the physics literature and referred to as "the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge".
  While we cover all values of $\Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, the case $\Lambda&lt; 0$ is of particular significance to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our result can also be viewed in general as a first step towards the understanding of the interior of hairy black holes.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Convergent Numerical Method for Abstract Cauchy Problem with Fractional Derivative of Caputo Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exponentially convergent numerical method to approximate the solution of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous fractional differential equation with an unbounded operator coefficient and Caputo fractional derivative in time. The numerical method is based on the newly obtained solution formula that consolidates the mild solution representations of sub-parabolic, parabolic and sub-hyperbolic equations with sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and non-zero initial data. The involved integral operators are approximated using the sinc-quadrature formulas that are tailored to the spectral parameters of $A$, fractional order $\alpha$ and the smoothness of the first initial condition, as well as to the properties of the equation's right-hand side $f(t)$. The resulting method possesses exponential convergence for positive sectorial $A$, any finite $t$, including $t = 0$ and the whole range $\alpha \in (0,2)$. It is suitable for a practically important case, when no knowledge of $f(t)$ is available outside the considered interval $t \in [0, T]$. The algorithm of the method is capable of multi-level parallelism. We provide numerical examples that confirm the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Continuum Limits of Ollivier's Ricci Curvature on data clouds: pointwise consistency and global lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ denote a low-dimensional manifold embedded in Euclidean space and let ${X}= \{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ be a collection of points uniformly sampled from it. We study the relationship between the curvature of a random geometric graph built from ${X}$ and the curvature of the manifold $M$ via continuum limits of Ollivier's discrete Ricci curvature. We prove pointwise, non-asymptotic consistency results and also show that if $M$ has Ricci curvature bounded from below by a positive constant, then the random geometric graph will inherit this global structural property with high probability. We discuss applications of the global discrete curvature bounds to contraction properties of heat kernels on graphs, as well as implications for manifold learning from data clouds. In particular, we show that our consistency results allow for estimating the intrinsic curvature of a manifold by first estimating concrete extrinsic quantities.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization for random scattering zippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a proof of dynamical localization for a random scattering zipper model. The scattering zipper operator is the product of two unitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right by random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this configuration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To prove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of fractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the Lyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the exponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices. We then establish an explicit formula of the coefficients of the finite resolvent in terms of the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's complement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential decay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization.</description>
