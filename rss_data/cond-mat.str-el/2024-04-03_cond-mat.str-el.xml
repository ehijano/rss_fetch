      <title>Ground state properties of the Heisenberg-compass model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compass models provide insights into the properties of Mott-insulating materials that host bond-dependent anisotropic interactions between their pseudospin degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the classical and quantum ground state properties of one such model relevant to certain layered perovskite materials akin to Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ - namely, the Heisenberg-compass model on the square lattice. We first investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model using classical Monte Carlo simulations. These reveal that the low temperature classical phase diagram is divided into six different classes of long-range ordered phases, including four phases that exhibit an order by disorder selection and two phases that are stabilized energetically. This model admits a special duality transformation, known as the Klein duality, conveniently allowing to map one region of coupling parameters onto another and constraining the phase diagram, and which we exploit in our study. From the analysis of the zero-point energy and the free energy of the spin waves, we find that order by quantum disorder at zero temperature and order by thermal disorder select the same orderings as those found from classical Monte Carlo simulations. We further investigate the quantum ground states of this model using numerical exact diagonalization on small clusters by exploiting the translational symmetry of the square lattice. We obtain a ground state phase diagram bearing close resemblance to that found from the classical analysis.</description>

      <title>Retaining Landau quasiparticles in the presence of realistic charge fluctuations in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge excitation spectra are getting clear in cuprate superconductors in momentum-energy space especially around a small momentum region, where plasmon excitations become dominant. Here, we study whether Landau quasiparticles survive in the presence of charge fluctuations observed in experiments. We employ the layered t-J model with the long-range Coulomb interaction, which can reproduce the realistic charge fluctuations. We find that Landau quasiparticles are retained in a realistic temperature and doping region, although the quasiparticle spectral weight is strongly reduced to 0.08-0.24. Counterintuitively, the presence of this small quasiparticle weight does not work favorably to generate a pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Spin and bond-charge excitation spectra in correlated electron systems near antiferromagnetic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic and bond-charge interactions can arise from the same microscopic interaction. Motivated by this observation, we compute magnetic and bond-charge excitation spectra on an equal footing by introducing a simple effective model on a square lattice, which describes antiferromagnetic and d-wave superconducting phases around half-filling on the electron-doped side. The magnetic excitation spectrum Im chi(q, omega) has strong weight around q=(pi, pi) in low energy and its intensity map exhibits a pencil-tip-like shape in q-omega space. Around q=(0,0) magnetic excitations show a steep dispersion toward the (pi, pi) and (pi,0) directions, which is very similar to a spin-wave dispersion although the system is non-magnetic. Bond-charge excitations are characterized by four different symmetries and studied for all possible couplings. Bond-charge fluctuations with three different symmetries have large spectral weight around q=(pi, pi) in a relatively low-energy region and extend widely more than the magnetic excitation spectrum. The d-wave symmetry of bond-charge excitations also has sizable spectral weight along the direction (pi/2, pi/2)-(0, 0)-(pi/2, 0) in a low-energy region and exhibits softening around q approx (0.5 pi, 0), whereas no such softening is present in the other symmetries. These results capture the essential features observed in electron-doped cuprates and may motivate an experimental test of bond-charge excitations around q=(pi, pi) on top of the strong magnetic excitations there as well as additional softening in the d-wave channel in the (pi, pi)-(pi/2, pi/2) region at low temperatures near the magnetic phase. We extend the present analysis to the hole-doped side and highlight a contrast to the electron-doped side, which includes incommensurate correlations, electronic nematic correlations, and spin and bond-charge resonance modes in the superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Tunability of charge density wave in a magnetic kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the charge density wave order (CDW) within a magnetically ordered phase in the kagome lattice FeGe has provided a promising platform to investigate intertwined degrees of freedom in kagome lattices. Recently, a method based on post-annealing has been suggested to manipulate the CDW order in kagome FeGe towards either long-range or suppressed orders. Here, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the experimentally measured electronic structures of FeGe crystals that have undergone different post-annealing procedures and demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness on tuning the CDW gap without strong perturbation on the underlying electronic structure. Moreover, we observe an additional low temperature transition that only appears in crystals with a long-range CDW order, which we associate with a lattice-spin coupled order. Our work indicates a likely strong sensitivity of the CDW order to disorder in FeGe, and provides evidence for strong coupling between the electronic, lattice, and spin degrees of freedom in this kagome magnet.</description>

      <title>Transmigration of Edge States with Interaction in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of Hubbard and Kondo interactions on the edge states in the half-filled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of electrons is investigated by studying the behaviour of charge quasiparticles using Kumar representation and density matrix renormalization group method. For any finite dimerization of hopping, by increasing the Hubbard interaction, the edge states are found to transmigrate from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap through an intermediate phase without the edge states. The extent of this phase with no edge states shrinks smoothly upon increasing the dimerization. The transmigration of edge states from the charge gap to the high energy gap is also found to occur with Kondo interaction, but through an intermediate phase which itself changes from having no edge states for weak dimerization to having the edge states in the physical as well as the high energy gaps coexisting from moderate to strong dimerization.</description>

      <title>High temperature series expansions of S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin models: algorithm to include the magnetic field with optimized complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an algorithm for calculating high temperature series expansions (HTSE) of Heisenberg spin models with spin $S=1/2$ in the thermodynamic limit. This algorithm accounts for the presence of a magnetic field. The paper begins with a comprehensive introduction to HTSE and then focuses on identifying the bottlenecks that limit the computation of higher order coefficients. HTSE calculations involve two key steps: graph enumeration on the lattice and trace calculations for each graph. The introduction of a non-zero magnetic field adds complexity to the expansion because previously irrelevant graphs must now be considered: bridged graphs. We present an efficient method to deduce the contribution of these graphs from the contribution of sub-graphs, that drastically reduces the time of calculation for the last order coefficient (in practice increasing by one the order of the series at almost no cost). Previous articles of the authors have utilized HTSE calculations based on this algorithm, but without providing detailed explanations. The complete algorithm is publicly available, as well as the series on many lattice and for various interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, whether in bulk form or reduced to just a single layer, have potential applications in spintronics and capacity for advanced quantum phenomena. A prerequisite for harnessing these opportunities lies in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the spin behavior in 2D materials. The low dimensionality motivates an understanding of the spin correlations over a wide length scale, from local to long range order. In this context, we focus on the magnetism in bulk \MPSe ~and \MPS, 2D layered van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductors. These materials have similar honeycomb Mn layers and magnetic ordering temperatures, but distinct spin orientations and exchange interactions. We utilize neutron scattering to gain deeper insights into the local magnetic structures and spin correlations in the paramagnetic and ordered phases by systematically investigating a MnPS$_{x}$Se$_{3-x}$ ($x$ = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3) series of powder samples using total neutron scattering measurements. By employing magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis, we unraveled the short-range magnetic correlations in these materials and explored how the non-magnetic anion S/Se mixing impacts the magnetic correlations. The results reveal that the magnetism can be gradually tuned through alteration of the non-magnetic S/Se content, which tunes the atomic structure. The change in magnetic structure is also accompanied by a control of the magnetic correlation length within the 2D honeycomb layers. Complimentary inelastic neutron scattering measurements allowed a quantification of the change in the magnetic exchange interactions for the series and further highlighted the gradual evolution of spin interactions in the series MnPS$_{x}$Se$_{3-x}$.</description>

      <title>Ab initio exploration of short-pitch skyrmion materials: Role of orbital frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the skyrmion lattice phase with a short lattice constant has attracted attention due to its high skyrmion density, making it a promising option for achieving high-density storage memory and for observing novel phenomena like the quantized topological Hall effect. Unlike conventional non-centrosymmetric systems where the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction plays a crucial role, the short pitch skyrmion phase requires a quadratic magnetic interaction $J(q)$ with a peak at finite-$Q$, and weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy is also critical. Thus, conducting first-principles evaluations is essential for understanding the formation mechanism as well as for promoting the discovery of new skyrmion materials. In this {\it Perspective}, we focus on recent developments of the first-principles evaluations of these properties and apply them to the prototype systems Gd$T_2X_2$ and Eu$T_2X_2$, where $T$ denotes a transition metal and $X$ represents Si or Ge. In particular, based on the spin density functional theory with the Hubbard correction combined with the Liechtenstein method in the Wannier tight-binding model formalism, we first show that the Hubbard $U$ and Hund's coupling is essential to stabilize a skyrmion lattice state by enhancing the easy-axis anisotropy. We then discuss mechanisms of finite-$Q$ instability and show that competition among Gd-5$d$ orbitals determines whether ferromagnetism or a finite-$Q$ structure is favored in Gd$T_2$Si$_2$ with $T=$ Fe and Ru. Our systematic calculations reveal that GdRu$_2$$X_2$, GdOs$_2$$X_2$, and GdRe$_2X_2$ are promising, while GdAg$_2X_2$, GdAu$_2X_2$, and EuAg$_2X_2$ are possible candidates as the skyrmion host materials. Analysis based on a spin spiral calculation for the candidate materials is also presented.</description>

      <title>Valley-controlled photoswitching of metal-insulator nanotextures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial heterogeneity and phase competition are hallmarks of strongly-correlated materials, promising tunable functionality on the nanoscale. Light-induced switching of a correlated insulator to a metallic state is well established. However, optical excitation generally lacks the specificity to select sub-wavelength domains and control final textures. Here, we employ valley-selective photodoping to drive the domain-specific quench of a textured Peierls insulator. Polarized excitation leverages the anisotropy of quasi-one-dimensional states at the correlated gap to initiate an insulator-to-metal transition with minimal electronic heating. We find that averting dissipation facilitates domain-specific carrier confinement, control over nanotextured phases, and a prolonged lifetime of the metastable metallic state. Complementing existing manipulation schemes, valley-selective photoexcitation will enable the activation of electronic phase separation beyond thermodynamic limitations, facilitating optically-controlled hidden states, engineered heterostructures, and polarization-sensitive percolation networks.</description>

      <title>Discovery of universal phonon thermal Hall effect in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal Hall effect (THE) in insulator is a remarkable phenomenon that arises from the motion of chargeless quasi-particles under a magnetic field. While magnons or exotic spin excitations were considered as the origin of THE in some magnetic materials, there are more and more evidences suggest that phonons play a significant role. However, the mechanism behind phonon THE is still unknown. Here we report the observation of THE, including planar THE, in a broad range of non-magnetic insulators and semiconductor: SrTiO$_3$, SiO$_2$ (quartz), MgO and Si. While the presence of antiferrodistortive domains in SrTiO$_3$ and chiral phonons in SiO$_2$ may complicate the interpretation of THE, the striking observations of THE in the trivial insulator MgO and high-purity intrinsic semiconductor Si demonstrate that phonon THE is a universal property of crystals. Without other effects on phonons such as from magnons, this universal phonon THE is characterized by a scaling law of |$\kappa_{xy}$| $\sim$ $\kappa_{xx}^2$. Our results experimentally discover a fundamental physics of phonons in magnetic field, which must come from the direct coupling between atom vibrations and the field. Starting from this universal phonon THE in crystals, all previous interpretations of THE in magnetic or non-magnetic materials need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>Integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in pentalayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically analyze the recently reported observation of integer (IQAHE) and fractional (FQAHE) quantum anomalous Hall effects at zero applied magnetic field in pentalayer graphene. Our quantitative activation and variable range hopping transport analysis of the experimental data reveals that the observed IQAHE and FQAHE at different fillings all have similar excitation gaps of the order of $5-10$ K. In addition, we also find that the observed FQAHE manifests a large hidden background contact series resistance &gt;10 k$\Omega$ of unknown origin whereas this contact resistance is much smaller ~500 $\Omega$ in the observed IQAHE. Both of these findings are surprising as well as inconsistent with the well-established phenomenology of the corresponding high-field integer and fractional quantum Hall effects in 2D semiconductor systems.</description>

      <title>Normal weak eigenstate thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable interacting models. For intensive observables that are sums of local operators, because of their polynomially vanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm, weak eigenstate thermalization occurs in quadratic and integrable interacting systems. Here, we unveil a novel weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models whose single-particle sector exhibits quantum chaos (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we show that there are few-body observables with a nonvanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm that are guarrantied to exhibit a polynomially vanishing variance of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. For quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians, we prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the 3D Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XYZ and XXZ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce cppdlr, a C++ library implementing the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) of functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency, such as Green's functions and self-energies. The DLR is based on a low-rank approximation of the analytic continuation kernel, and yields a compact and explicit basis consisting of exponentials in imaginary time and simple poles in Matsubara frequency. cppdlr constructs the DLR basis and associated interpolation grids, and implements standard operations. It provides a flexible yet high-level interface, facilitating the incorporation of the DLR into both small-scale applications and existing large-scale software projects.</description>

Abstract: We propose the regularized recurrent inference machine (rRIM), a novel machine-learning approach to solve the challenging problem of deriving the pairing glue function from measured optical spectra. The rRIM incorporates physical principles into both training and inference and affords noise robustness, flexibility with out-of-distribution data, and reduced data requirements. It effectively obtains reliable pairing glue functions from experimental optical spectra and yields promising solutions for similar inverse problems of the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra: examples in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intriguing feature of type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra is that the entropy of the mixed states is negative. Although the type classification of von Neumann algebra and its consequence in holography have been extensively explored recently, there has not been an explicit calculation of entropy in some physically interesting models with type II$_1$ algebra. In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy $S_n$ of the fixed length state $\{|n\rangle\}$ in Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, which has been recently shown to exhibit type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra. These states furnish an orthogonal basis for 0-particle chord Hilbert space. We systematically study $S_n$ and its R\'enyi generalizations $S_n^{(m)}$ in various limit of DSSYK model, ranging $q\in[0,1]$. We obtain exotic analytical expressions for the scaling behavior of $S_n^{(m)}$ at large $n$ for random matrix theory limit ($q=0$) and SYK$_2$ limit ($q=1$), for the former we observe highly non-flat entanglement spectrum. We then dive into triple scaling limits where the fixed chord number states become the geodesic wormholes with definite length connecting left/right AdS$_2$ boundary in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. In semi-classical regime, we match the boundary calculation of entanglement entropy with the dilaton value at the center of geodesic, as a nontrivial check of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Quantum Processor for the Analysis of Strongly Correlated Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic approach for analyzing strongly correlated systems by adapting the conventional quantum cluster method to a quantum circuit model. We have developed a more concise formula for calculating the cluster's Green's function, requiring only real-number computations on the quantum circuit instead of complex ones. This approach is inherently more suited to quantum circuits, which primarily yield statistical probabilities. As an illustrative example, we explored the Hubbard model on a 2D lattice. The ground state is determined utilizing Xiaohong, a superconducting quantum processor equipped with 66 qubits, supplied by QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. Subsequently, we employed the circuit model to compute the real-time retarded Green's function for the cluster, which is then used to determine the lattice Green's function. We conducted an examination of the band structure in the insulator phase of the lattice system. This preliminary investigation lays the groundwork for exploring a wealth of innovative physics within the field of condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Spin caloritronics as a probe of nonunitary superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting spintronics focuses on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism and has sparked significant interest in nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting phenomena. However, a direct test for nonunitary superconductors is currently absent, and their identification is challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate that spin current driven by the thermal gradient sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. We should note that the spin polarization of the condensate in the momentum space induces the spin-Seebeck effect, and the spin-dependent chirality (spin-chirality) of the condensate induces the spin-Nernst effect in nonunitary superconductors. Notably, the nonvanishing spin-Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity in materials because it reflects the spin polarization of the Cooper pairs in the momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. Our results position the spin caloritronics phenomena as a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide valuable insights into problems in strongly correlated many-body systems. Confinement which arises when matter is coupled to gauge fields is just one of the open problems, where LGT formalism can explain the underlying mechanism. However, coupling gauge fields to dynamical charges complicates the theoretical and experimental treatment of the problem. Developing a simplified mean-field theory is thus one of the ways to gain new insights into these complicated systems. Here we develop a mean-field theory of a paradigmatic 1+1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with superconducting pairing term, the gauged Kitaev chain, by decoupling charge and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fields while enforcing the Gauss law on the mean-field level. We first determine the phase diagram of the original model in the context of confinement, which allows us to identify the symmetry-protected topological transition in the Kitaev chain as a confinement transition. We then compute the phase diagram of the effective mean-field theory, which correctly captures the main features of the original LGT. This is furthermore confirmed by the Green's function results and a direct comparison of the ground state energy. This simple LGT can be implemented in state-of-the art cold atom experiments. We thus also consider string-length histograms and the electric field polarization, which are easily accessible quantities in experimental setups and show that they reliably capture the various phases.</description>

      <title>Anyon exclusions statistics on surfaces with gapped boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.02604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An anyon exclusion statistics, which generalizes the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics of bosons and fermions, was proposed by Haldane[1]. The relevant past studies had considered only anyon systems without any physical boundary but boundaries often appear in real-life materials. When fusion of anyons is involved, certain `pseudo-species' anyons appear in the exotic statistical weights of non-Abelian anyon systems; however, the meaning and significance of pseudo-species remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an extended anyon exclusion statistics on surfaces with gapped boundaries, introducing mutual exclusion statistics between anyons as well as the boundary components. Motivated by Refs. [2, 3], we present a formula for the statistical weight of many-anyon states obeying the proposed statistics. We develop a systematic basis construction for non-Abelian anyons on any Riemann surfaces with gapped boundaries. From the basis construction, we have a standard way to read off a canonical set of statistics parameters and hence write down the extended statistical weight of the anyon system being studied. The basis construction reveals the meaning of pseudo-species. A pseudo-species has different `excitation' modes, each corresponding to an anyon species. The `excitation' modes of pseudo-species corresponds to good quantum numbers of subsystems of a non-Abelian anyon system. This is important because often (e.g., in topological quantum computing) we may be concerned about only the entanglement between such subsystems.</description>

      <title>Intertwined van-Hove Singularities as a Mechanism for Loop Current Order in Kagome Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments on Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs,Rb,K) indicated spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in the charge density wave state in the absence of static magnetization. The loop current order (LCO) is proposed as its cause, but a microscopic model explaining the emergence of LCO through electronic correlations has not been firmly established. We show that the coupling between van-Hove singularities (vHS) with distinct mirror symmetries is a key ingredient to generate LCO ground state. By constructing an effective model, we find that when multiple vHS with opposite mirror eigenvalues are close in energy, the nearest-neighbor electron repulsion favors a ground state with coexisting LCO and charge bond order. It is then demonstrated that this mechanism applies to the Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings provide an intriguing mechanism of LCO and pave the way for a deeper understanding of complex quantum phenomena in Kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Are fermionic quantum critical systems more entangled?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behaviour, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalises the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially-transposed density matrix.</description>

      <title>Multiband Metallic Ground State in Multilayered Nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Probed by $^{139}$La-NMR at Ambient Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a $^{139}$La-NMR study of polycrystalline samples of multi($n$)-layered nickelates, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ ($n=2$) and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$ ($n=3$), at ambient pressure. Measurements of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and nuclear spin relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) indicate the emergence of a density wave order with a gap below $T^*\sim150$ K for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and $\sim130$ K for La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10-\delta}$. The finite value of $1/T_1$ below $T^*$ indicates metallic ground states with the remaining density of states at the Fermi level ($E_{\rm F}$) under the density wave order. These features are attributed to multiple $d$ electron bands with different characteristics. Above $T^*$, the gradual decrease in $1/T_1T$ upon cooling implies the presence of a band with flat dispersion near $E_{\rm F}$. From our microscopic probes, we point out that these nickelates ($n=2$ and $3$) possess similar electronic states despite the difference in the formal valence of the Ni-$d$ electron states, which provides a basis for understanding the novel high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity under high pressures.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Kondo screening in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the Kondo effect of a spin-1/2 impurity coupled to a two-dimensional altermagnet host material. To attain the low-temperature many-body Kondo physics of the system, we have performed a numerical renormalization group calculations that allows us to access the spectral properties of the system at zero temperature. The impurity spectral function and the Kondo temperature were calculated for different set of parameters, including Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and an external magnetic field. Interestingly, in the RSOC and altermagnetic fields, the hybridization function is spin independent, despite the characteristic broken time-reversal symmetry of the altermagnet. This is because the alternating sign of the spin splitting of the bands in the momentum space renders equal contributions for both spin components of the hybridization function. Our results demonstrate that, although the hybridization function is time-reversal symmetric, the Kondo temperature is substantially suppressed by the altermagnet coupling. Moreover, we have investigated the effect of an external magnetic field applied in the altermagnet along different directions. Interestingly, we observe an important restraining of the Kondo peak which depends strongly on the direction of the field. This anisotropic effect is, however, masked if strong Zeeman splitting takes place at the impurity, as it shatters the Kondo-singlet state.</description>

      <title>Incremental SWAP Operator for Entanglement Entropy: Application for Exponential Observables in Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to efficiently compute the entanglement entropy (EE) of quantum many-body systems. Our approach, called the incremental SWAP operator method , combines the simplicity of the SWAP operator used in projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations with recent advances in precisely computing exponential observables using incremental algorithms. We apply this technique to obtain accurate EE data at reduced computational cost for 1d and 2d antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models with different bipartition schemes. Using the computed EE data, we extract the area law coefficient, universal logarithmic corrections from Goldstone modes, and the geometric constant, finding quantitative agreement with analytical predictions. Moreover, for the first time in an unbiased numerical simulation of 2d antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we successfully obtain reliable universal logarithmic corrections from sharp corners that match expected theoretical values. The consistency between our numerical results and theoretical calculations demonstrates the power of our approach for accessing challenging universal entanglement properties. The extensions of our method to other quantum spin/boson models and the interacting fermion models, are outlined.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of nodal $d$-wave superconductivity, N\'eel order and charge order on the square lattice at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a SU(2) lattice gauge theory on the square lattice, with a single fundamental complex fermion and a single fundamental complex boson on each lattice site. Projective symmetries of the gauge-charged fermions are chosen so that they match with those of the spinons of the $\pi$-flux spin liquid. Global symmetries of all gauge-invariant observables are chosen to match with those of the particle-hole symmetric electronic Hubbard model at half-filling. Consequently, both the fundamental fermion and fundamental boson move in an average background $\pi$-flux, their gauge-invariant composite is the physical electron, and eliminating gauge fields in a strong gauge-coupling expansion yields an effective extended Hubbard model for the electrons. The SU(2) gauge theory displays several confining/Higgs phases: a nodal $d$-wave superconductor, and states with N\'eel, valence-bond solid, charge, or staggered current orders. There are also a number of quantum phase transitions between these phases which are very likely described by 2+1 dimensional deconfined conformal gauge theories, and we present large flavor expansions for such theories. These include the phenomenologically attractive case of a transition between an insulator with N\'eel order and a $d$-wave superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points in the Brillouin zone.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

Abstract: Rare-earth tritellurides are van-der-Waals antiferromagnets which have been attracting attention as materials not only with high mobility, but also with various states such as superconductivity under high pressure, incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) phase, and multiple antiferromagnetic phases. In this work, we performed longitudinal resistivity and Hall resistivity measurements simultaneously in exfoliated $R$Te$_{3}$ ($R$ =La, Ce, Tb) thin film devices, in order to investigate the influence of magnetic ordering on transport properties in van-der-Waals magnetic materials. We have obtained carrier mobility and concentration using a two-band model, and have observed an increase in carrier mobility in the antiferromagnets CeTe$_{3}$ and TbTe$_{3}$ due to the magnetic transition. Especially in CeTe$_{3}$, the carrier concentration has changed drastically below the magnetic transition temperature, suggesting the interaction between the CDW and antiferromagnetic phases. In addition, the analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in CeTe$_{3}$ supports the possibility of Fermi surface modulation by magnetic ordering. This research will pave the way not only for spintronic devices that take advantage of high mobility, but also for the study of the correlation between CDW and magnetism states in low-dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: This work verifies the existence of dispersive \textit{nodal-arcs} and their evolution into Weyl nodes under the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in NbAs &amp; NbP. The obtained features mimic the observations as reported for TaAs &amp; TaP in our previous work. In addition, this work reports that the number of nodes in TaAs class of Weyl semimetals (WSMs) can be altered via creating strain along $a$ or $c$ direction of the crystal. For instance, the number of nodes in NbAs under SOC-effect along with 2% (3%) tensile-strain in $a$ direction is found to be 40 (56) in its full Brillouin zone (BZ). Besides the nodes, such strain are found to have considerable impact on the nodal-lines of these WSMs when effect of SOC is ignored. A 3\% tensile (compressive) strain along the $a$ ($c$) direction leads to the partially merging of nodal-lines (without SOC) in the extended BZ of NbAs \&amp; NbP, which is not observed in TaAs &amp; TaP within the range of -3% to 3% strain. Apart from this, the work discusses the role of Weyl physics in affecting the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) of any WSM. In this direction, it is discussed that how a symmetric Weyl cone, even if tilted, will have no contribution to the $S$ of WSMs. Furthermore, the work highlights the conditions under which a Weyl cone can contribute to the $S$ of a given WSM. Lastly, the discussion of Weyl contribution to $S$ is validated over TaAs class of WSMs via investigating the features of their Weyl cones and calculating the contributions of such cones to the $S$ of these semimetals. The value of $S$ contributed from Weyl cone is found to be as large as $\sim$65 $\mu$\textit{V}/\textit{K} below 25 K in case of TaAs. The findings of this work present a possibility of engineering the topological properties of TaAs class of WSMs via creating strain in their crystal. It also makes the picture of Weyl physics impact on the $S$ of WSMs a more clear.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes for Finite Size Extrapolation of Many-Body Simulations</title>

Abstract: Key to being able to accurately model the properties of realistic materials is being able to predict their properties in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, because most many-body electronic structure methods scale as a high-order polynomial, or even exponentially, with system size, directly simulating large systems in their thermodynamic limit rapidly becomes computationally intractable. As a result, researchers typically estimate the properties of large systems that approach the thermodynamic limit by extrapolating the properties of smaller, computationally-accessible systems based on relatively simple scaling expressions. In this work, we employ Gaussian processes to more accurately and efficiently extrapolate many-body simulations to their thermodynamic limit. We train our Gaussian processes on Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors to extrapolate the energies of one-dimensional hydrogen chains obtained using two high-accuracy many-body methods: Coupled Cluster theory and Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). In so doing, we show that Gaussian processes trained on relatively short, 10-30-atom chains can predict the energies of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous hydrogen chains in their thermodynamic limit with sub-milliHartree accuracy. Unlike standard scaling expressions, our GPR-based approach is highly generalizable given representative training data and is not dependent on systems' geometries or dimensionality. This work highlights the potential for machine learning to correct for the finite size effects that routinely complicate the interpretation of finite size many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Addressing energy density functionals in the language of path-integrals I: Comparative study of diagrammatic techniques applied to the (0+0)-D $O(N)$-symmetric $\varphi^{4}$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13044</link>

Abstract: The energy density functional (EDF) method is currently the only microscopic theoretical approach able to tackle the entire nuclear chart. Nevertheless, it suffers from limitations resulting from its empirical character and deteriorating its reliability. This paper is part of a larger program that aims at formulating the EDF approach as an effective field theory (EFT) in order to overcome these limitations. A relevant framework to achieve this is the path-integral (PI) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT). The latter indeed provides a wide variety of treatments of the many-body problem well suited to deal with non-perturbative interactions and to exploit a Lagrangian resulting from an EFT as a starting point. While developing the formalism in a general setting, we present a comparative study of such techniques applied to a toy model, i.e. the (0+0)-D $O(N)$-symmetric $\varphi^{4}$-theory. More specifically, our focus will be on the following diagrammatic techniques: loop expansion (LE), optimized perturbation theory (OPT) and self-consistent perturbation theory (SCPT). With these methods, we notably address the spontaneous breakdown of the $O(N)$ symmetry with care especially since spontaneous symmetry breakings (SSBs) play a paramount role in current implementations of the EDF approach.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and unconventional superconductivity in a simple model of metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting metal-organic framework Cu-BHT forms a kagome lattice with metals at the vertices and ligands along the bonds. This bipartite motif is common in reticular materials. We show that a tight-binding model on this lattice yields partially occupied interference-induced flat bands at half-filling with large gaps between them and all other bands. Long-range hopping induces curvature in the bands but leaves them flatter and more isolated than those in twisted bilayer graphene. The slave boson theory of the t-J model on this lattice shows highly unconventional superconductivity including an f -wave singlet phase. Thus, framework materials provide an ideal lattice-driven approach to strongly correlated phenomena in flat bands at high electronic densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning models capable of handling the large datasets collected in the financial world can often become black boxes expensive to run. The quantum computing paradigm suggests new optimization techniques, that combined with classical algorithms, may deliver competitive, faster and more interpretable models. In this work we propose a quantum-enhanced machine learning solution for the prediction of credit rating downgrades, also known as fallen-angels forecasting in the financial risk management field. We implement this solution on a neutral atom Quantum Processing Unit with up to 60 qubits on a real-life dataset. We report competitive performances against the state-of-the-art Random Forest benchmark whilst our model achieves better interpretability and comparable training times. We examine how to improve performance in the near-term validating our ideas with Tensor Networks-based numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and partial gap in the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature of about 80~K in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ single crystals under pressure has received enormous attention. La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ is not superconducting under ambient pressure but exhibits a transition at $T^{\ast} \simeq 115$~K. Understanding the electronic correlations and charge dynamics is an important step towards the origin of superconductivity and other instabilities. Here, our optical study shows that La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ features strong electronic correlations which significantly reduce the electron's kinetic energy and place this system in the proximity of the Mott phase. The low-frequency optical conductivity reveals two Drude components arising from multiple bands at the Fermi level. The transition at $T^{\ast}$ removes the Drude component exhibiting non-Fermi liquid behavior, whereas the one with Fermi-liquid behavior is barely affected. These observations in combination with theoretical results suggest that the Fermi surface dominated by the Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital is removed due to the transition at $T^{\ast}$. Our experimental results provide pivotal information for understanding the transition at $T^{\ast}$ and superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement Dynamics of Fractons in Tilted Bose-Hubbard Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic constraints can lead to exotic properties of quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the dynamics of fracton excitations on top of the ground states of a one-dimensional, dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model. We show that nearby fractons undergo a collective motion mediated by exchanging virtual dipole excitations, which provides a powerful dynamical tool to characterize the underlying ground state phases. We find that in the gapped Mott insulating phase, fractons are confined to each other as motion requires the exchange of massive dipoles. When crossing the phase transition into a gapless Luttinger liquid of dipoles, fractons deconfine. Their transient deconfinement dynamics scales diffusively and exhibits strong but subleading contributions described by a quantum Lifshitz model. We examine prospects for the experimental realization in tilted Bose-Hubbard chains by numerically simulating the adiabatic state preparation and subsequent time evolution, and find clear signatures of the low-energy fracton dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multi-party entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that precludes entanglement-free regions, and thus protects quantum correlations. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Direction-dependent conductivity in planar Hall set-ups with tilted Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the magnetoelectric conductivity tensors in planar Hall set-ups, which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $ \mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin, and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1) change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $; and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on $\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological phase transition in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model is studied using a real-space approach. An effective Hamiltonian for the topologically protected edge-modes in a finite-size system is developed. The topological phase transition is understood in terms of a global perturbation to the system which lifts the degeneracy of the edge-modes. The effective-Hamiltonian method is also applied to a system with spatially varying hopping strengths.</description>
