      <title>Assessing Uncertainty in Stock Returns: A Gaussian Mixture Distribution-Based Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study seeks to advance the understanding and prediction of stock market return uncertainty through the application of advanced deep learning techniques. We introduce a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution to capture the complex, time-varying nature of asset return distributions in the Chinese stock market. By incorporating the Gaussian mixture distribution, our approach effectively characterizes short-term fluctuations and non-traditional features of stock returns, such as skewness and heavy tails, that are often overlooked by traditional models. Compared to GARCH models and their variants, our method demonstrates superior performance in volatility estimation, particularly during periods of heightened market volatility. It provides more accurate volatility forecasts and offers unique risk insights for different assets, thereby deepening the understanding of return uncertainty. Additionally, we propose a novel use of Code embedding which utilizes a bag-of-words approach to train hidden representations of stock codes and transforms the uncertainty attributes of stocks into high-dimensional vectors. These vectors are subsequently reduced to two dimensions, allowing the observation of similarity among different stocks. This visualization facilitates the identification of asset clusters with similar risk profiles, offering valuable insights for portfolio management and risk mitigation. Since we predict the uncertainty of returns by estimating their latent distribution, it is challenging to evaluate the return distribution when the true distribution is unobservable. However, we can measure it through the CRPS to assess how well the predicted distribution matches the true returns, and through MSE and QLIKE metrics to evaluate the error between the volatility level of the predicted distribution and proxy measures of true volatility.</description>

      <title>No Fear of Discounting How to Manage the Transition from EONIA to ESTR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important step in the Financial Benchmarks Reform was taken on 13th September 2018, when the ECB Working Group on Euro Risk-Free Rates recommended the Euro Short-Term Rate ESTR as the new benchmark rate for the euro area, to replace the Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA) which will be discontinued at the end of 2021. This transition has a number of important consequences on financial instruments, OTC derivatives in particular.
  In this paper we show in detail how the switch from EONIA to ESTR affects the pricing of OIS, IRS and XVAs. We conclude that the adoption of the "clean discounting" approach recommended by the the ECB, based on ESTR only, is theoretically sound and leads to very limited impacts on financial valuations.
  This finding ensures the possibility, for the financial industry, to switch all EUR OTC derivatives, either cleared with Central Counterparties, or subject to bilateral collateral agreements, or non-collateralised, in a safe and consistent manner. The transition to such EONIA-free pricing framework is essential for the complete elimination of EONIA before its discontinuation scheduled on 31st December 2021.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Market Risks on New Pension System and Government Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how market risks impact the sustainability and performance of the New Pension System (NPS). NPS relies on defined contributions from both employees and employers to build a corpus during the employee's service period. Upon retirement, employees use the corpus fund to sustain their livelihood. A critical concern for individuals is whether the corpus will grow sufficiently to be sustainable or if it will deplete, leaving them financially vulnerable at an advanced age. We explore the impact of market risks on the performance of the corpus resulting from the NPS. To address this, we quantify market risks using Monte Carlo simulations with historical data to model their impact on NPS. We quantify the risk of pension corpus being insufficient and the cost to the Government to hedge the risk arising from guaranteeing the pension.</description>

      <title>The impact of climate policy uncertainty on financial market resilience: Evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resilience serves to assess the ability of the financial market to resist external shocks and to recover from shocks. The intensity and duration, used to indicate resilience, are calculated for China's financial market in this paper, focusing on the performance of each financial sub-market during and after several crises. Also, given that climate issues have been recognized as an important source of risk by financial market, we investigate the connectedness and mechanism of China's climate policy uncertainty (CPU) to its financial market resilience. We have found that the two resilience indicators of each market have a relatively consistent trend, but connectedness among markets has different sensitivities to both. In addition, China's CPU affects its financial market resilience by increasing the investor sentiment index and the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks, and by reducing the capital and financial account balance. It is further found that China's financial markets' consensus on the unswerving implementation of climate policy, which provides the reference for other countries on how to balance climate policy's introduction and financial market development.</description>
