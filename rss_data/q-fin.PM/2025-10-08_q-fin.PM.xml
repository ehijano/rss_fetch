      <title>Signed network models for portfolio optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider weighted signed network representations of financial markets derived from raw or denoised correlation matrices, and examine how negative edges can be exploited to reduce portfolio risk. We then propose a discrete optimization scheme that reduces the asset selection problem to a desired size by building a time series of signed networks based on asset returns. To benchmark our approach, we consider two standard allocation strategies: Markowitz's mean-variance optimization and the 1/N equally weighted portfolio. Both methods are applied on the reduced universe as well as on the full universe, using two datasets: (i) the Market Champions dataset, consisting of 21 major S&amp;P500 companies over the 2020-2024 period, and (ii) a dataset of 199 assets comprising all S&amp;P500 constituents with stock prices available and aligned with Google's data. Empirical results show that portfolios constructed via our signed network selection perform as good as those from classical Markowitz model and the equal-weight benchmark in most occasions.</description>

      <title>The New Quant: A Survey of Large Language Models in Financial Prediction and Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are reshaping quantitative investing by turning unstructured financial information into evidence-grounded signals and executable decisions. This survey synthesizes research with a focus on equity return prediction and trading, consolidating insights from domain surveys and more than fifty primary studies. We propose a task-centered taxonomy that spans sentiment and event extraction, numerical and economic reasoning, multimodal understanding, retrieval-augmented generation, time series prompting, and agentic systems that coordinate tools for research, backtesting, and execution. We review empirical evidence for predictability, highlight design patterns that improve faithfulness such as retrieval first prompting and tool-verified numerics, and explain how signals feed portfolio construction under exposure, turnover, and capacity controls. We assess benchmarks and datasets for prediction and trading and outline desiderata-for time safe and economically meaningful evaluation that reports costs, latency, and capacity. We analyze challenges that matter in production, including temporal leakage, hallucination, data coverage and structure, deployment economics, interpretability, governance, and safety. The survey closes with recommendations for standardizing evaluation, building auditable pipelines, and advancing multilingual and cross-market research so that language-driven systems deliver robust and risk-controlled performance in practice.</description>

      <title>FinReflectKG: Agentic Construction and Evaluation of Financial Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The financial domain poses unique challenges for knowledge graph (KG) construction at scale due to the complexity and regulatory nature of financial documents. Despite the critical importance of structured financial knowledge, the field lacks large-scale, open-source datasets capturing rich semantic relationships from corporate disclosures. We introduce an open-source, large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset built from the latest annual SEC 10-K filings of all S and P 100 companies - a comprehensive resource designed to catalyze research in financial AI. We propose a robust and generalizable knowledge graph (KG) construction framework that integrates intelligent document parsing, table-aware chunking, and schema-guided iterative extraction with a reflection-driven feedback loop. Our system incorporates a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, combining rule-based checks, statistical validation, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments to holistically measure extraction quality. We support three extraction modes - single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based - allowing flexible trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, and reliability based on user requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the reflection-agent-based mode consistently achieves the best balance, attaining a 64.8 percent compliance score against all rule-based policies (CheckRules) and outperforming baseline methods (single-pass and multi-pass) across key metrics such as precision, comprehensiveness, and relevance in LLM-guided evaluations.</description>
