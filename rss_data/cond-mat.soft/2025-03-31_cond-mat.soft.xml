      <title>Shape instabilities driven by topological defects in nematic polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) are stimuli-responsive materials formed from polymeric chains cross-linked with rod-like mesogenic segments, which, in the nematic phase, align along a non-polar director. A key characteristic of these nematic systems is the existence of singularities in the director field, known as topological defects or disclinations, and classified by their topological charge. In this study, we address the open question of modeling mathematically the coupling between mesogens disclination and polymeric network by providing a mathematical framework describing the out-of-plane shape changes of initially flat LCN sheets containing a central topological defect. Adopting a variational approach, we define an energy associated with the deformations consisting of two contributions: an elastic energy term accounting for spatial director variations, and a strain-energy function describing the elastic response of the polymer network. The interplay between nematic elasticity, which seeks to minimize distortions in the director field, variations in the degree of order, with the consequent tendency of monomers in the polymer chains to distribute anisotropically in response to an external stimulus, and mechanical stiffness, which resists deformation, determines the resulting morphology. We analyze the transition to instability of the ground-state flat configuration and characterize the corresponding buckling modes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transition in the growth of programmable polymorphic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hallmark feature of polymorphic systems is their ability to assemble into many possible structures at the same thermodynamic state. Designer polymorphic materials can in principle be engineered via programmable self-assembly, but the robustness of the assembly process depends on dynamical factors that are poorly understood. Here we predict a new failure mode for the growth of multicomponent polymorphic materials, in which dynamical coexistence occurs between ordered and disordered assembly trajectories. We show that this transition is preceded by the formation of a steady-state disordered wetting layer, suggesting a nonequilibrium analogy to pre-melting phenomena at equilibrium. This dynamical phase transition is likely to occur in a variety of systems and may fundamentally limit the complexity of polymorphic materials that can be designed through programmable self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Hyperuniformity of Disordered Network Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in materials design and manufacturing have allowed for the production of ordered and disordered metamaterials with diverse and novel properties. Hyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials, which anomalously suppress density fluctuations on large length scales compared to typical disordered systems, and network materials are two classes of metamaterial that have desirable physical properties. Recent focus has been placed on the design of disordered hyperuniform network metamaterials that inherit the desirable properties of both of these metamaterial classes. In this work, we focus on determining the extent to which network structures derived from the spatial tessellations of hyperuniform point patterns inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point patterns. In particular, we examine the Delaunay, Voronoi, Delaunay-Centroidal, and Gabriel tessellations of nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform point patterns in two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space. We use the spectral density to characterize the density fluctuations of two-phase media created by thickening the edges of these tessellations in two dimensions and introduce a novel variance-based metric to characterize the network structures directly in two and three dimensions. We find that, while none of the tessellations completely inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point pattern, the degree to which the hyperuniformity is inherited is sensitive to the tessellation scheme and the short- and long-range translational disorder in the point pattern, but not to the choice of beam shape when mapping the networks into two-phase media.</description>

      <title>Static and hydrodynamic periodic structures induced by AC electric fields in the antiferroelectric SmZA phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the effect of AC electric fields in the range of 0.1-300 kHz on planar antiferroelectric SmZA layers of DIO. Significant results are (a) primary bifurcation into a quasistationary periodic instability with its voltage threshold Uc and wave vector qc along the initial director being, respectively, quadratic and linear functions of f over 10-150 kHz, and with an azimuthal distortion of the director which changes sign between adjacent stripes, (b) transition from the modulated planar state to a homogeneous state at higher voltages, and (c) third bifurcation into travelling wave periodic state on further rise in U in the region 10-40 kHz. We interpret these findings as follows. The low voltage instability is very similar to that seen in the higher temperature apolar nematic phase, and is the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) instability possibly belonging to the region of dielectric inversion frequency. The azimuthal distortions of n result from an undulatory distortion of the SmZA layers in the book-shelf geometry. The intermediate homogeneous state of SmZA in which the periodic structure is absent results from a linear coupling between the layer polarization P and applied field E, giving rise to a scissoring type mutual P reorientation in adjacent layers. Finally, at even higher voltages, the medium goes over to a field induced transition to the ferroelectric nematic, with the polarization following the AC field, and the periodic EHD instability being similar to that of the dielectric regime. The polar vector symmetry of the medium leads in general to travelling waves.</description>

      <title>Quantitative characterization of hydrophobic agglomeration at different mixing intensities using a copula-based probabilistic modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The agglomeration of small poorly wetted alumina particles in a stirred tank is investigated. For different experimental conditions, two bivariate probability densities for the area-equivalent diameter and aspect ratio of primary particles and agglomerates, respectively, are determined, using 2D image data from an inline camera system. Throughout each experiment, these densities do not change since the geometries of primary particles are unaffected by the experimental conditions, while large agglomerates fragment into multiple smaller ones, which results in an equilibrium state regarding the distribution of agglomerate descriptors. Mixtures of these densities are used to model the contents of the stirred tank at each time step of the experiments. Analytical functions, whose parameters characterize the agglomeration dynamics, are fitted to the time-dependent weights of these mixtures. This enables a quantitative comparison of agglomeration processes, highlighting the impact of mixing intensity on the joint distribution of agglomerate descriptors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Particle Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular materials such as gravel, cereals, or pellets, are ubiquitous in nature, daily life, and industry. While sharing some characteristics with gases, liquids, and solids, granular matter exhibits a wealth of phenomena that defy these analogies and are yet to be fully understood. Advancing granular physics requires experimental observation at the level of individual particles and over a wide range of dynamics. Specifically, it calls for the ability to track large numbers of particles simultaneously, in three dimensions (3D), and with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we introduce magnetic resonance particle tracking (MRPT) and show it to achieve such recording with resolution on the scale of micrometers and milliseconds. Enabled by MRPT, we report the direct study of granular glassy dynamics in 3D. Tracking a vibrated granular system over six temporal orders of magnitude revealed dynamical heterogeneities, two-step relaxation, and structural memory closely akin to 3D glass formation in supercooled liquids and colloids. These findings illustrate broad prospective utility of MRPT in advancing the exploration, theory, and numerical models of granular matter.</description>

      <title>Cracking Down on Fracture to Functionalise Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel relationship between topology and damage propagation in Maxwell lattices that redefines fracture as a functional design feature rather than mere degradation. We demonstrate that topologically protected modes, inherently robust against perturbations, localise along lattice discontinuities and govern the mechanical response. By precisely engineering the microstructure, we direct these modes to control stress distributions and trigger predictable, controlled damage. Our findings -- validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments -- advance our understanding of nontrivial mechanical responses in Maxwell lattices and establish a clear framework for designing materials with improved fracture energy. This work paves the way for further exploration of topology-driven phenomena in mechanical systems and promises a new direction in the design of robust materials.</description>

      <title>Transforming Siliconization into Slippery Liquid-like Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Siliconization is widely used as a coating technique to engineer surface properties, such as in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries to lubricate motion, ensure complete dispensation of product, and to inhibit protein adsorption and biofilm growth. In the hitherto unconnected literature, there has recently been significant progress in understanding the concept of surfaces slippery to liquids. Whereas in the siliconization industry the wettability of surfaces focuses on the hydrophobicity, as measured by contact angle and surface energy, for surfaces slippery to liquids the focus is on the contact angle hysteresis (droplet-on-solid static friction). Moreover, it has been discovered that surfaces with similar static wetting properties can have dramatically different droplet kinetic friction. Here, we report a simple-to-apply coating method to create ultra-low contact angle hysteresis liquid-like coatings for glass (G), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyurethane (PU), and stainless steel (SS); materials that are used for pharmaceutical/parenteral packaging and medical equipment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the coating's slow sliding dynamics surface properties for water droplets, which indicate high droplet kinetic friction, can be converted into fast sliding dynamics, which indicate low droplet kinetic friction, by a simple molecular capping (methylation) process. Our results provide new insight into key aspects of siliconization coatings in the context of industrial/commercial processes.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Solvent-Induced Negative Energetic Elasticity in a Lattice Polymer Chain''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent Letter, Shirai and Sakumichi [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023), arXiv:2202.12483] presented a study focusing on the origin of a temperature-dependent negative contribution $G_U(T)$ to the elastic modulus $G(T)$ of hydrogels [Yoshikawa et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011045 (2021)]. The authors support their findings through an energy-related stiffness $k_U(r,T)$ obtained from a single chain, with $r$ being the end-to-end distance of a random walk on a 3D lattice. It is argued that the parameter $\varepsilon$ related to polymer-solvent interactions is positive, so the energy $E_s$ of an elongated state should be smaller than the energy $E_b$ of a more compact state. We believe that the analogy between $G_U(T)$ and $k_U(r,T)$ might have misled their claim that $G_U(T)&lt;0$ when $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Infrared Dielectric Function of Photochromic Thiazolothiazole Embedded Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the infrared dielectric function of photochromic dipyridinium thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole embedded in polymer is reported. Bulk thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-embedded polymer samples were prepared by drop casting and dehydration in room temperature. The samples were investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry before and after irradiation with a 405~nm diode laser in the infrared spectral range from 500 cm-1 to 1800 cm-1. The model dielectric functions of the thiazolothiazole embedded polymer film for its TTz2+ (unirradiated) and TTz0 (irradiated) states are composed of a series of Lorentz oscillators in the measured spectral range. A comparison of the obtained complex dielectric functions for the TTz2+ and TTz0 states shows that the oscillators located in the spectral ranges 500 cm-1 - 700 cm-1, 1300 cm-1 - 1400 cm-1, and 1500 cm-1 - 1700 cm-1 change in both amplitude and resonant frequency upon transition between the states. Additionally, a resonance at approximately 1050 cm-1 exhibited a change in oscillator amplitude but not resonant frequency due to the photochromic transition.</description>

      <title>Ostwald Ripening of Buoyancy-Driven Microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbubble solutions have a wide range of industrial applications, including heat transfer, agriculture, and water treatment. Therefore, understanding and controlling the size variation of bubbles is critical. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework for Ostwald ripening in buoyancy-driven microbubbles by introducing a height-dependent size distribution function. For the first time, we show that the population balance equation in steady state can be interpreted within the Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner theory when the distribution function is redefined as the density distribution of the buoyancy-induced flux. Notably, in this form of Ostwald ripening, the distribution function approaches a scaled universal distribution, not over time, but as a function of height. We analytically derive the scaled universal distribution and show that the fifth power of the mean radius of the bubbles grows linearly with height.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced mechanism for giant enhancement of transport generated by active fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter is one of the hottest topics in physics nowadays. As a prototype of living systems operating in viscous environments it has usually been modeled in terms of the overdamped dynamics. Recently, active matter in the underdamped regime has gained a place in the spotlight. In this work we unveil another remarkable face of active matter. In doing so we demonstrate and explain an inertia-induced mechanism of giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations which does emerge neither in the overdamped nor in the underdamped limit but occurs exclusively in the strong damping regime. It may be relevant not only for living systems where fluctuations generated by the metabolism are active by default but also for artificial ones, in particular for designing ultrafast micro and nano-robots. Our findings open new avenues of research in a very vibrant field of active matter.</description>

      <title>Bouncing microdroplets on hydrophobic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intuitively, slow droplets stick to a surface and faster droplets splash or bounce. However, recent work suggests that on non-wetting surfaces, whether microdroplets stick or bounce depends only on their size and fluid properties, but not on the incoming velocity. Here, we show using theory and experiments that even poorly wetting surfaces have a velocity-dependent criterion for bouncing of aqueous droplets, which is as high as 6 m/s for diameters of 30-50 microns on hydrophobic surfaces such as Teflon. We quantify this criterion by analyzing the interplay of dissipation, surface adhesion, and incoming kinetic energy, and describe a wealth of associated phenomena, including air bubbles and satellite droplets. Our results on inertial microdroplets elucidate fundamental processes crucial to aerosol science and technology.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact-angle size-dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact-angle cosine for both axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a commonly used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact-angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact-line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, the adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the contribution related to the contact line in the leading order and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using droplet-size dependences of the contact angle for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets under the same conditions.</description>

Abstract: We mimic the mechanical response of touch mechanoreceptors by that of a gas cavity embedded in an elastic semi-cylinder, as a fingertip analogue. Using tribological experiments combined with optical imaging, we measure the dynamics and deformation of the cavity as the semi-cylinder is put in static contact or slid against model rough surfaces at constant normal force and velocity. We propose an elastic model to predict the cavity deformation under normal load showing that membrane mechanical stresses are anisotropic and we discuss its possible biological consequences. In friction experiments, we show that the cavity shape fluctuations allow for texture discriminations.</description>

      <title>Rubber Wear: History, Mechanisms, and Perspectives</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of wear mechanisms, with a primary focus on rubber wear under sliding conditions. Beginning with classical wear theories, including the Archard and Rabinowicz models, we analyze their applicability to both metals and elastomers and discuss extensions relevant to elastic contact and multiscale surface roughness. Various experimental studies on rubber, such as abrasion by sharp tools, erosion by particle impact, and wear during sliding on rough substrates, are reviewed and interpreted. The effects of environmental factors, such as oxygen and lubrication, are also discussed. In addition, we review a recently proposed wear model based on fatigue crack growth within asperity contact regions, which accounts for energy dissipation and multiscale interactions. This model explains the wide variability in the wear coefficient and predicts wear rates consistent with experimental observations across a broad range of conditions. It also explains the formation mechanism and provides the size distribution of rubber wear particles, from micrometer-scale up to severe cut-chip-chunk (CCC) wear. The results have implications for tire wear and the environmental impact of microscale wear debris (microplastics).</description>

      <title>Giant increase of diffusion by small rise of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficient usually decreases when friction increases. We analyze the opposite behavior in the paradigmatic system consisting of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential and driven by an unbiased time periodic force. For tailored parameter set in strong dissipation regime the particle spreading can be giantly amplified: if the friction is twice as large then the diffusion grows up to five orders of magnitude. The mechanism lying behind this effect is related to bifurcation of periodic orbits oscillating around the potential maximum and their symmetric displacement towards the adjacent potential minima when the friction coefficient increases. On the other hand, in the weak dissipation regime, where the increase of diffusion vs friction is also observed, the effect is induced by a non-monotonic change of population of the running orbits. However, in this regime the enhancement of diffusion is much smaller.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of barocaloric neopentyl glycol</title>

Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time the molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the molecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <title>Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15512</link>

Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>
