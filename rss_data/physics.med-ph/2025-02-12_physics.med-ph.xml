      <title>Compound Mask for Divergent Wave Imaging in Medical Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divergent wave imaging with coherent compounding allows obtaining broad field of view and higher frame rate with respect to line by line insonification. However, the spatial and contrast resolution crucially depends on the weights applied in the compound phase, whose optimization is often cumbersome and based on trial and error. This study addresses these limitations by introducing a closed-form approach that maps the transmit apodization weights used in synthetic aperture imaging into the compound mask applied to divergent wave imaging. The approach draws inspiration from a successful technique developed for plane wave imaging, leveraging synthetic aperture imaging as a reference due to its superior image quality. It works for both linear and convex geometries and arbitrary spatial arrangements of virtual sources generating divergent waves. The approach has been validated through simulated data using both linear and convex probes, demonstrating that the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) in Divergent Wave Linear Array (DWLA) increased by 7.5% at 20 mm and 9% at 30 mm compared to Synthetic Aperture Linear Array (SALA). For Divergent Wave Convex Array (DWCA), the increase was 1.64% at 20 mm and 26.56% at 30 mm compared to Synthetic Aperture Convex Array (SACA), witnessing the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study on Human Brain Cortical Electrostimulation Assessment During Uniform Magnetic Field Exposure at Intermediate Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Permissible limits have been established by international guidelines and standards for human protection to electromagnetic field exposure to prevent adverse health effects stemming from electrostimulation in the most sensitive body part. That is the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the intermediate frequency range (300 Hz to 100 kHz) and the central nervous system (CNS) at lower frequencies. However, there is a need to reevaluate protection limits against CNS electrostimulation in the intermediate frequency range, considering the importance of brain tissues during electromagnetic head exposure. This study aims to derive the level of CNS cortical stimulation to evaluate compliance with existing protection limits. Method: Multi-scale computation modelling was used to evaluate neuron stimulation thresholds by integrating individual neurons into realistic anatomical head models. Five different excitable membrane models within the motor cortex were examined across three human head models, providing the most comprehensive and extensive evaluation to date. Results: Current protection limits are confirmed as conservative, with non-compliance observed in only 0.02% and 2.4% of axons under clamped and sealed boundary conditions, respectively. The study highlights significant intersubject variability (up to 600% mean threshold) and clarifies the influence of neural excitation models on permissible level assessments. Conclusion: Current electric field limits are conservative for CNS electrostimulation in the intermediate frequencies range, but the margin of safety decreases at higher frequencies, warranting further evaluation. Impact: The findings and methodology contribute to the rationale and provide valuable insights for revising electromagnetic safety exposure guidelines.</description>
