      <title>Forecasting the Price of Rice in Banda Aceh after Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to predict the price of rice in Banda Aceh after the occurrence of Covid-19. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation technique has been used to solve the problem of missing values from this research data. Furthermore, the technique used to forecast rice prices in Banda Aceh is auto-ARIMA which is the best ARIMA model based on AIC, AICC, or BIC values. The results of this research show that the ARIMA model (0,0,5) is the best model to predict the prices of lower quality rice I (BKB1), lower quality rice II (BKB2), medium quality rice I (BKM1), medium quality rice II (BKM2), super quality rice I (BKS1), and super quality rice II (BKS2). Based on this model, the results of forecasting rice prices for all qualities show that there was a decline for some time (between September 1, 2023 and September 6, 2023) and then remained constant (between September 6, 2023 and December 31, 2023).</description>

      <title>What events matter for exchange rate volatility ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper expands on stochastic volatility models by proposing a data-driven method to select the macroeconomic events most likely to impact volatility. The paper identifies and quantifies the effects of macroeconomic events across multiple countries on exchange rate volatility using high-frequency currency returns, while accounting for persistent stochastic volatility effects and seasonal components capturing time-of-day patterns. Given the hundreds of macroeconomic announcements and their lags, we rely on sparsity-based methods to select relevant events for the model. We contribute to the exchange rate literature in four ways: First, we identify the macroeconomic events that drive currency volatility, estimate their effects and connect them to macroeconomic fundamentals. Second, we find a link between intraday seasonality, trading volume, and the opening hours of major markets across the globe. We provide a simple labor-based explanation for this observed pattern. Third, we show that including macroeconomic events and seasonal components is crucial for forecasting exchange rate volatility. Fourth, our proposed model yields the lowest volatility and highest Sharpe ratio in portfolio allocations when compared to standard SV and GARCH models.</description>

      <title>Quantile deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is crucial in time series prediction, and quantile regression offers a valuable mechanism for uncertainty quantification which is useful for extreme value forecasting. Although deep learning models have been prominent in multi-step ahead prediction, the development and evaluation of quantile deep learning models have been limited. We present a novel quantile regression deep learning framework for multi-step time series prediction. In this way, we elevate the capabilities of deep learning models by incorporating quantile regression, thus providing a more nuanced understanding of predictive values. We provide an implementation of prominent deep learning models for multi-step ahead time series prediction and evaluate their performance under high volatility and extreme conditions. We include multivariate and univariate modelling, strategies and provide a comparison with conventional deep learning models from the literature. Our models are tested on two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, using daily close-price data and selected benchmark time series datasets. The results show that integrating a quantile loss function with deep learning provides additional predictions for selected quantiles without a loss in the prediction accuracy when compared to the literature. Our quantile model has the ability to handle volatility more effectively and provides additional information for decision-making and uncertainty quantification through the use of quantiles when compared to conventional deep learning models.</description>

      <title>CatNet: Effective FDR Control in LSTM with Gaussian Mirrors and SHAP Feature Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM with the Gaussian Mirror (GM) method. To evaluate the feature importance of LSTM in time series, we introduce a vector of the derivative of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to measure feature importance. We also propose a new kernel-based dependence measure to avoid multicollinearity in the GM algorithm, to make a robust feature selection with controlled FDR. We use simulated data to evaluate CatNet's performance in both linear models and LSTM models with different link functions. The algorithm effectively controls the FDR while maintaining a high statistical power in all cases. We also evaluate the algorithm's performance in different low-dimensional and high-dimensional cases, demonstrating its robustness in various input dimensions. To evaluate CatNet's performance in real world applications, we construct a multi-factor investment portfolio to forecast the prices of S\&amp;P 500 index components. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional LSTM models without feature selection and FDR control. Additionally, CatNet effectively captures common market-driving features, which helps informed decision-making in financial markets by enhancing the interpretability of predictions. Our study integrates of the Gaussian Mirror algorithm with LSTM models for the first time, and introduces SHAP values as a new feature importance metric for FDR control methods, marking a significant advancement in feature selection and error control for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Estimating the roughness exponent of stochastic volatility from discrete observations of the integrated variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the roughness of the volatility process in a stochastic volatility model that arises as a nonlinear function of fractional Brownian motion with drift. To this end, we introduce a new estimator that measures the so-called roughness exponent of a continuous trajectory, based on discrete observations of its antiderivative. The estimator has a very simple form and can be computed with great efficiency on large data sets. It is not derived from distributional assumptions but from strictly pathwise considerations. We provide conditions on the underlying trajectory under which our estimator converges in a strictly pathwise sense. Then we verify that these conditions are satisfied by almost every sample path of fractional Brownian motion (with drift). As a consequence, we obtain strong consistency theorems in the context of a large class of rough volatility models, such as the rough fractional volatility model and the rough Bergomi model. We also demonstrate that our estimator is robust with respect to proxy errors between the integrated and realized variance, and that it can be applied to estimate the roughness exponent directly from the price trajectory. Numerical simulations show that our estimation procedure performs well after passing to a scale-invariant modification of our estimator.</description>

      <title>Tuning into Climate Risks: Extracting Innovation from Television News for Clean Energy Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops multiple novel climate risk measures (or variables) based on the television news coverage by Bloomberg, CNBC, and Fox Business, and examines how they affect the systematic and idiosyncratic risks of clean energy firms in the United States. The measures are built on climate related keywords and cover the volume of coverage, type of coverage (climate crisis, renewable energy, and government &amp; human initiatives), and media sentiments. We show that an increase in the aggregate measure of climate risk, as indicated by coverage volume, reduces idiosyncratic risk while increasing systematic risk. When climate risk is segregated, we find that systematic risk is positively affected by the physical risk of climate crises and transition risk from government &amp; human initiatives, but no such impact is evident for idiosyncratic risk. Additionally, we observe an asymmetry in risk behavior: negative sentiments tend to decrease idiosyncratic risk and increase systematic risk, while positive sentiments have no significant impact. These findings remain robust to including print media and climate policy uncertainty variables, though some deviations are noted during the COVID-19 period.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Long-Short Stock Portfolio Allocation: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an empirical study explores the application of deep learning algorithms-Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer-in constructing long-short stock portfolios. Two datasets comprising randomly selected stocks from the S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ indices, each spanning a decade of daily data, are utilized. The models predict daily stock returns based on historical features such as past returns,Relative Strength Index (RSI), trading volume, and volatility. Portfolios are dynamically adjusted by longing stocks with positive predicted returns and shorting those with negative predictions, with equal asset weights. Performance is evaluated over a two-year testing period, focusing on return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics. The results demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning models in enhancing long-short stock portfolio performance.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach to Predict the Fall [of Price] of Cryptocurrency Long Before its Actual Fall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern times, the cryptocurrency market is one of the world's most rapidly rising financial markets. The cryptocurrency market is regarded to be more volatile and illiquid than traditional markets such as equities, foreign exchange, and commodities. The risk of this market creates an uncertain condition among the investors. The purpose of this research is to predict the magnitude of the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market. Risk factor is also called volatility. Our approach will assist people who invest in the cryptocurrency market by overcoming the problems and difficulties they experience. Our approach starts with calculating the risk factor of the cryptocurrency market from the existing parameters. In twenty elements of the cryptocurrency market, the risk factor has been predicted using different machine learning algorithms such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. All of the models have been applied to the calculated risk factor parameter. A new model has been developed to predict better than the existing models. Our proposed model gives the highest RMSE value of 1.3229 and the lowest RMSE value of 0.0089. Following our model, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin, etc. Where the other existing models, the highest RMSE was 14.5092, and the lower was 0.02769. So, the proposed model performs much better than models with proper generalization. Using our approach, it will be easier for investors to trade in complicated and challenging financial assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin.</description>
