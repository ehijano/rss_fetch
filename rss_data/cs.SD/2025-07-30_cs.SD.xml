      <title>Combolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks, evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved interpretability.</description>

      <title>Relationship between objective and subjective perceptual measures of speech in individuals with head and neck cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meaningful speech assessment is vital in clinical phonetics and therapy monitoring. This study examined the link between perceptual speech assessments and objective acoustic measures in a large head and neck cancer (HNC) dataset. Trained listeners provided ratings of intelligibility, articulation, voice quality, phonation, speech rate, nasality, and background noise on speech. Strong correlations were found between subjective intelligibility, articulation, and voice quality, likely due to a shared underlying cause of speech symptoms in our speaker population. Objective measures of intelligibility and speech rate aligned with their subjective counterpart. Our results suggest that a single intelligibility measure may be sufficient for the clinical monitoring of speakers treated for HNC using concomitant chemoradiation.</description>

      <title>SpeechFake: A Large-Scale Multilingual Speech Deepfake Dataset Incorporating Cutting-Edge Generation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As speech generation technology advances, the risk of misuse through deepfake audio has become a pressing concern, which underscores the critical need for robust detection systems. However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools. The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46 languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity, and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing more robust models for evolving generation techniques.</description>

      <title>Whilter: A Whisper-based Data Filter for "In-the-Wild" Speech Corpora Using Utterance-level Multi-Task Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers, non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to a combination of single-task alternatives.</description>

      <title>TTS-1 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Automatic Speech Recognition Model for Shona Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers worldwide.</description>

      <title>Sync-TVA: A Graph-Attention Framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Cross-Modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However, existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA, an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.</description>

      <title>Model-free Speculative Decoding for Transformer-based ASR with Token Map Drafting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting}, a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model. Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU, highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-modal Emotion Recognition (MER) system designed to enhance emotion recognition accuracy in challenging acoustic conditions. Our approach combines a modified and extended Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT) for multi-channel audio processing with an R(2+1)D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model for video analysis. We evaluate our proposed method on a reverberated version of the Ryerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS) dataset using synthetic and real-world Room Impulse Responsess (RIRs). Our results demonstrate that integrating audio and video modalities yields superior performance compared to uni-modal approaches, especially in challenging acoustic conditions. Moreover, we show that the multimodal (audiovisual) approach that utilizes multiple microphones outperforms its single-microphone counterpart.</description>

      <title>Latent Swap Joint Diffusion for 2D Long-Form Latent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability. More generation demos are available at https://swapforward.github.io/</description>

      <title>Audio Flamingo 3: Advancing Audio Intelligence with Fully Open Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech, sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3 modalities of speech, sound, and music; (ii) flexible, on-demand thinking, allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering; (iii) multi-turn, multi-audio chat; (iv) long audio understanding and reasoning (including speech) up to 10 minutes; and (v) voice-to-voice interaction. To enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL, AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger datasets.</description>

      <title>LLAMAPIE: Proactive In-Ear Conversation Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.</description>

Abstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences.</description>
