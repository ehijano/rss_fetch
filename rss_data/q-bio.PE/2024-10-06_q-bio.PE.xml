      <title>Tournament versus Circulant: On Simulating 7-Species Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games with Ablated Predator-Prey Networks as Models of Biodiversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations of minimal population-dynamics models have long been used to explore questions in ecosystems coexistence and species biodiversity, via simple agent-based models of three interacting species, referred to as $R$, $P$, and $S$, and where individual agents compete with one another in predator/prey contests that are determined by the cyclic dominance rules of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Recent publications have explored the dynamics of five-species models, based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) game. A 2022 paper by Zhong et al. reported simulation studies of species coexistence in spatial RPSLS systems in which one or more directed edges are ablated from the five-vertex tournament digraph defining the RPSLS game: Zhong et al. showed that the ablation of a single inter-species interaction can lead to a collapse in biodiversity. In this paper I present first results from simulation studies of evolutionary spatial cyclic games where there are seven species, but where each species is still in its own local five-species RPSLS-like interaction network: the dominance networks I use for this are a subset of the $n$-node $k$-regular circulant digraphs $D(n,\Omega)$ for odd-numbered $n$ and $|\Omega|=2$. My results indicate that Zhong et al.'s results are due to the specific fully-connected tournament dominance network used in their RPSLS model: when other, equally realistic, RPSLS-style dominance networks are used instead, no such sudden collapse in biodiversity occurs.

      <title>Individual vaccination as Nash equilibrium in a SIR model with application to the 2009-10 Influenza A(H1N1) epidemic in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vaccination against ongoing epidemics is seldom compulsory but remains one of the most classical means to fight epidemic propagation. However recent debates concerning the innocuity of vaccines and their risk with respect to the risk of the epidemic itself lead to severe vaccination campaign failures and new mass behaviors appeared driven by individual self-interest. Prompted by this context we analyze, in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, whether egocentric individuals can reach an equilibrium with the rest of the society. Using techniques from the "Mean Field Games" theory, we extend previous results and show that an equilibrium exists and characterizes completely the individual best vaccination strategy (with or without discounting). We also compare with a strategy based only on overall societal optimization and exhibit a situation with non-negative price of anarchy. Finally, we apply the theory to the 2009-2010 Influenza A (H1N1) vaccination campaign in France and hint that a group of individuals stopped vaccinating at levels that indicated a pessimistic perception of the risk of the vaccine.</description>

      <title>Never Mind The No-Ops: Faster and Less Volatile Simulation Modelling of Co-Evolutionary Species Interactions via Spatial Cyclic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Issues in co-evolutionary population dynamics have long been studied via computationally intensive simulations of minimally simple agent-based models, known as Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games (ESCGs), involving multiple interacting biological species in which each agent has its own unique spatial location in a cell on a regular lattice, and can move from cell to cell over time. Many papers have been published exploring the dynamics of ESCGs where competitive inter-species predator/prey relationships are modelled via the cyclic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) for three species, or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) for five. At the core of these simulations is the "Elementary Step" (ES), in which one or two agents are chosen at random to either compete to the death, or to reproduce, or to move location. ESCG studies typically involve executing trillions of ESs and hence the computational efficiency of the core ES algorithm is a key concern. In this paper I demonstrate that the de facto standard "Original ES" (OES) algorithm is computationally inefficient both in time and in space due to the implicit execution of many "no-op" commands (i.e., commands that do nothing) and because at steady state large numbers of cells can be empty, and yet empty cells serve no purpose. I present a new "Revised ES" (RES) algorithm which eliminates these inefficiencies, and I show empirically that ESCGs with RES exhibit qualitatively the same characteristics as those with OES, and are also markedly more stable. The more stable dynamics of RES-based simulations means that they can be run with smaller lattices than when using OES, leading to reductions in total simulation times of 85% or more.

      <title>Approximate Bayesian computation for Markovian binary trees in phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00194</link>

Abstract: Phylogenetic trees describe the relationships between species in the evolutionary process, and provide information about the rates of diversification. To understand the mechanisms behind macroevolution, we consider a class of multitype branching processes called Markovian binary trees (MBTs). MBTs allow for trait-based variation in diversification rates, and provide a flexible and realistic probabilistic model for phylogenetic trees. We develop an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) scheme to infer the rates of MBT parameters by exploiting the information in the shapes of phylogenetic trees. We evaluate the accuracy of this inference method using simulation studies, and find that our method is able to detect variation in the diversification rates, with accuracy comparable to, and generally better than, likelihood-based methods. In an application to a real-life phylogeny of squamata, we reinforce conclusions drawn from earlier studies, in particular supporting the existence of ovi-/viviparity transitions in both directions. Our method demonstrates the potential for more complex models of evolution to be employed in phylogenetic inference, in conjunction with likelihood-free schemes.</description>

      <title>A Reaction-Diffusion-Chemotaxis Model for Human Population Dynamics over Fractal Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advection of entities induced by gradients in attractant concentration fields is observed via diffusiophoresis in colloids and via chemotaxis in microorganisms. Mathematically, both diffusiophoresis and chemotaxis follow similar mathematical descriptions and display a variety of interesting behaviors that are not observed through other transport mechanisms. However, the application of such a mathematical framework has largely been restricted to soft matter research. In this article, we argue that this framework is more general and can be expanded to study human population dynamics. We assert that human populations also migrate chemotactically, but by sensing concentrations gradients in attractants such as resource availability, social connections, and safety indices. Therefore, we extend the Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, foundational to human population dynamics, to incorporate chemotactic advection. Furthermore, we introduce a fractal terrain to better mimic the human dispersal phenomena. Simulations demonstrate that, by including chemotaxis of a population toward attractants which are dispersed heterogenously over fractal terrains, population hotspots can appear from from initially uniformly dispersed states whereas Fisher-KPP without chemotaxis predicts a persistent tendency toward population uniformity. Varying the chemotactic migration yields fine control over inter- or intra-population segregation and thus the population growth rates may be substantially altered by considering the population-attractant coupling. This framework may be useful for characterizing historical population separations, and furthermore is particularly pertinent for predicting emergence of new population hotspots as climate change is expected to cause large-scale human displacement, which may be dictated by chemotactic movement of humans due to evolving concentration gradients in safety indices.</description>
