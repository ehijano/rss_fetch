      <title>A Hybrid Model for Weakly-Supervised Speech Dereverberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new training strategy to improve speech dereverberation systems using minimal acoustic information and reverberant (wet) speech. Most existing algorithms rely on paired dry/wet data, which is difficult to obtain, or on target metrics that may not adequately capture reverberation characteristics and can lead to poor results on non-target metrics. Our approach uses limited acoustic information, like the reverberation time (RT60), to train a dereverberation system. The system's output is resynthesized using a generated room impulse response and compared with the original reverberant speech, providing a novel reverberation matching loss replacing the standard target metrics. During inference, only the trained dereverberation model is used. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves more consistent performance across various objective metrics used in speech dereverberation than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>VINP: Variational Bayesian Inference with Neural Speech Prior for Joint ASR-Effective Speech Dereverberation and Blind RIR Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberant speech, denoting the speech signal degraded by the process of reverberation, contains crucial knowledge of both anechoic source speech and room impulse response (RIR). This work proposes a variational Bayesian inference (VBI) framework with neural speech prior (VINP) for joint speech dereverberation and blind RIR identification. In VINP, a probabilistic signal model is constructed in the time-frequency (T-F) domain based on convolution transfer function (CTF) approximation. For the first time, we propose using an arbitrary discriminative dereverberation deep neural network (DNN) to predict the prior distribution of anechoic speech within a probabilistic model. By integrating both reverberant speech and the anechoic speech prior, VINP yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations of the anechoic speech spectrum and CTF filter, respectively. After simple transformations, the waveforms of anechoic speech and RIR are estimated. Moreover, VINP is effective for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which sets it apart from most deep learning (DL)-based single-channel dereverberation approaches. Experiments on single-channel speech dereverberation demonstrate that VINP reaches an advanced level in most metrics related to human perception and displays unquestionable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in ASR-related metrics. For blind RIR identification, experiments indicate that VINP attains the SOTA level in blind estimation of reverberation time at 60 dB (RT60) and direct-to-reverberation ratio (DRR). Codes and audio samples are available online.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding of Frequency Dependence on Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, various analysis methods are conducted on frequency-dependent methods on SED to further delve into their detailed characteristics and behaviors on SED. While SED has been rapidly advancing through the adoption of various deep learning techniques from other pattern recognition fields, these techniques are often not suitable for SED. To address this issue, two frequency-dependent SED methods were previously proposed: FilterAugment, a data augmentation randomly weighting frequency bands, and frequency dynamic convolution (FDY Conv), an architecture applying frequency adaptive convolution kernels. These methods have demonstrated superior performance in SED, and we aim to further analyze their detailed effectiveness and characteristics in SED. We compare class-wise performance to find out specific pros and cons of FilterAugment and FDY Conv. We apply Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights time-frequency region that is more inferred by the model, on SED models with and without frequency masking and two types of FilterAugment to observe their detailed characteristics. We propose simpler frequency dependent convolution methods and compare them with FDY Conv to further understand which components of FDY Conv affects SED performance. Lastly, we apply PCA to show how FDY Conv adapts dynamic kernel across frequency dimensions on different sound event classes. The results and discussions demonstrate that frequency dependency plays a significant role in sound event detection and further confirms the effectiveness of frequency dependent methods on SED.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Multifaceted Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training Leveraging Hierarchical Selective State Space Model and Decoupled Cross-entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior efforts in building computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems often treat automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as separate fronts: the former aims to provide multiple pronunciation aspect scores across diverse linguistic levels, while the latter focuses instead on pinpointing the precise phonetic pronunciation errors made by non-native language learners. However, it is generally expected that a full-fledged CAPT system should perform both functionalities simultaneously and efficiently. In response to this surging demand, we in this work first propose HMamba, a novel CAPT approach that seamlessly integrates APA and MDD tasks in parallel. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, decoupled cross-entropy loss (deXent), specifically tailored for MDD to facilitate better-supervised learning for detecting mispronounced phones, thereby enhancing overall performance. A comprehensive set of empirical results on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on APA. Notably, our proposed approach also yields a considerable improvement in MDD performance over a strong baseline, achieving an F1-score of 63.85%.

      <title>RenderBox: Expressive Performance Rendering with Text Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressive music performance rendering involves interpreting symbolic scores with variations in timing, dynamics, articulation, and instrument-specific techniques, resulting in performances that capture musical can emotional intent. We introduce RenderBox, a unified framework for text-and-score controlled audio performance generation across multiple instruments, applying coarse-level controls through natural language descriptions and granular-level controls using music scores. Based on a diffusion transformer architecture and cross-attention joint conditioning, we propose a curriculum-based paradigm that trains from plain synthesis to expressive performance, gradually incorporating controllable factors such as speed, mistakes, and style diversity.
  RenderBox achieves high performance compared to baseline models across key metrics such as FAD and CLAP, and also tempo and pitch accuracy under different prompting tasks. Subjective evaluation further demonstrates that RenderBox is able to generate controllable expressive performances that sound natural and musically engaging, aligning well with prompts and intent.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Central Frequencies Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by nervous systems, revolutionizes information processing with its focus on efficiency and low power consumption. Using sparse coding, this paradigm enhances processing efficiency, which is crucial for edge devices with power constraints. The Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA), adapted for audio with Gammatone and Gammachirp filter banks, provides an efficient sparse coding method for neuromorphic speech processing. Adaptive LCA (ALCA) further refines this method by dynamically adjusting modulation parameters, thereby improving reconstruction quality and sparsity. This paper introduces an enhanced ALCA version, the ALCA Central Frequency (ALCA-CF), which dynamically adapts both modulation parameters and central frequencies, optimizing the speech representation. Evaluations show that this approach improves reconstruction quality and sparsity while significantly reducing the power consumption of speech classification, without compromising classification accuracy, particularly on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Allophony in Self-Supervised Speech Models for Atypical Pronunciation Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allophony refers to the variation in the phonetic realization of a phoneme based on its phonetic environment. Modeling allophones is crucial for atypical pronunciation assessment, which involves distinguishing atypical from typical pronunciations. However, recent phoneme classifier-based approaches often simplify this by treating various realizations as a single phoneme, bypassing the complexity of modeling allophonic variation. Motivated by the acoustic modeling capabilities of frozen self-supervised speech model (S3M) features, we propose MixGoP, a novel approach that leverages Gaussian mixture models to model phoneme distributions with multiple subclusters. Our experiments show that MixGoP achieves state-of-the-art performance across four out of five datasets, including dysarthric and non-native speech. Our analysis further suggests that S3M features capture allophonic variation more effectively than MFCCs and Mel spectrograms, highlighting the benefits of integrating MixGoP with S3M features.</description>

      <title>Advanced Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech for Background Removal and Preservation with Controllable Masked Speech Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acoustic background plays a crucial role in natural conversation. It provides context and helps listeners understand the environment, but a strong background makes it difficult for listeners to understand spoken words. The appropriate handling of these backgrounds is situation-dependent: Although it may be necessary to remove background to ensure speech clarity, preserving the background is sometimes crucial to maintaining the contextual integrity of the speech. Despite recent advancements in zero-shot Text-to-Speech technologies, current systems often struggle with speech prompts containing backgrounds. To address these challenges, we propose a Controllable Masked Speech Prediction strategy coupled with a dual-speaker encoder, utilizing a task-related control signal to guide the prediction of dual background removal and preservation targets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables precise control over the removal or preservation of background across various acoustic conditions and exhibits strong generalization capabilities in unseen scenarios.</description>

      <title>LoRP-TTS: Low-Rank Personalized Text-To-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech synthesis models convert written text into natural-sounding audio. While earlier models were limited to a single speaker, recent advancements have led to the development of zero-shot systems that generate realistic speech from a wide range of speakers using their voices as additional prompts. However, they still struggle with imitating non-studio-quality samples that differ significantly from the training datasets. In this work, we demonstrate that utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) allows us to successfully use even single recordings of spontaneous speech in noisy environments as prompts. This approach enhances speaker similarity by up to $30pp$ while preserving content and naturalness. It represents a significant step toward creating truly diverse speech corpora, that is crucial in all speech-related tasks.</description>

      <title>MT2KD: Towards A General-Purpose Encoder for Speech, Speaker, and Audio Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advances in deep learning, the performance of end-to-end (E2E) single-task models for speech and audio processing has been constantly improving. However, it is still challenging to build a general-purpose model with high performance on multiple tasks, since different speech and audio processing tasks usually require different training data, input features, or model architectures to achieve optimal performance. In this work, MT2KD, a novel two-stage multi-task learning framework is proposed to build a general-purpose speech and audio encoder that jointly performs three fundamental tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio tagging (AT) and speaker verification (SV). In the first stage, multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) is applied to align the feature spaces of three single-task high-performance teacher encoders into a single student encoder using the same unlabelled data. In the second stage, multi-task supervised fine-tuning is carried out by initialising the model from the first stage and training on the separate labelled data of each single task. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task training pipeline significantly outperforms a baseline model trained with multi-task learning from scratch. The final system achieves good performance on ASR, AT and SV: with less than 4% relative word-error-rate increase on ASR, only 1.9 lower mean averaged precision on AT and 0.23% absolute higher equal error rate on SV compared to the best-performing single-task encoders, using only a 66M total model parameters.</description>

      <title>mWhisper-Flamingo for Multilingual Audio-Visual Noise-Robust Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) combines lip-based video with audio and can improve performance in noise, but most methods are trained only on English data. One limitation is the lack of large-scale multilingual video data, which makes it hard hard to train models from scratch. In this work, we propose mWhisper-Flamingo for multilingual AVSR which combines the strengths of a pre-trained audio model (Whisper) and video model (AV-HuBERT). To enable better multi-modal integration and improve the noisy multilingual performance, we introduce decoder modality dropout where the model is trained both on paired audio-visual inputs and separate audio/visual inputs. mWhisper-Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art WER on MuAViC, an AVSR dataset of 9 languages. Audio-visual mWhisper-Flamingo consistently outperforms audio-only Whisper on all languages in noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning Source Disentanglement in Neural Audio Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have significantly advanced audio compression by efficiently converting continuous audio signals into discrete tokens. These codecs preserve high-quality sound and enable sophisticated sound generation through generative models trained on these tokens. However, existing neural codec models are typically trained on large, undifferentiated audio datasets, neglecting the essential discrepancies between sound domains like speech, music, and environmental sound effects. This oversight complicates data modeling and poses additional challenges to the controllability of sound generation. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Source-Disentangled Neural Audio Codec (SD-Codec), a novel approach that combines audio coding and source separation. By jointly learning audio resynthesis and separation, SD-Codec explicitly assigns audio signals from different domains to distinct codebooks, sets of discrete representations. Experimental results indicate that SD-Codec not only maintains competitive resynthesis quality but also, supported by the separation results, demonstrates successful disentanglement of different sources in the latent space, thereby enhancing interpretability in audio codec and providing potential finer control over the audio generation process.</description>

      <title>kNN For Whisper And Its Effect On Bias And Speaker Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition performance varies by language, domain, and speaker characteristics such as accent, but fine-tuning a model on any of these categories may lead to catastrophic forgetting. Token-level $k$ nearest neighbor search ($k$NN), first proposed for neural sequence decoders for natural language generation (NLG) and machine translation (MT), is a non-parametric method that instead adapts using inference-time search in an external datastore, without training the underlying model. We show that Whisper, a transformer end-to-end speech model, benefits from $k$NN. We investigate the differences between the speech and text setups. We discuss implications for speaker adaptation, and analyze improvements by gender, accent, and age.</description>

      <title>Robust Persian Digit Recognition in Noisy Environments Using Hybrid CNN-BiGRU Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced speech recognition applications. However, many existing neural network-based methods struggle with noise, reducing accuracy in real-world environments. This study addresses isolated spoken Persian digit recognition (zero to nine) under noisy conditions, particularly for phonetically similar numbers. A hybrid model combining residual convolutional neural networks and bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) is proposed, utilizing word units instead of phoneme units for speaker-independent recognition. The FARSDIGIT1 dataset, augmented with various approaches, is processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving 98.53%, 96.10%, and 95.92% accuracy on training, validation, and test sets, respectively. In noisy conditions, the proposed approach improves recognition by 26.88% over phoneme unit-based LSTM models and surpasses the Mel-scale Two Dimension Root Cepstrum Coefficients (MTDRCC) feature extraction technique along with MLP model (MTDRCC+MLP) by 7.61%.</description>

Abstract: Amphion is an open-source toolkit for Audio, Music, and Speech Generation, designed to lower the entry barrier for junior researchers and engineers in these fields. It provides a versatile framework that supports a variety of generation tasks and models. In this report, we introduce Amphion v0.2, the second major release developed in 2024. This release features a 100K-hour open-source multilingual dataset, a robust data preparation pipeline, and novel models for tasks such as text-to-speech, audio coding, and voice conversion. Furthermore, the report includes multiple tutorials that guide users through the functionalities and usage of the newly released models.</description>
