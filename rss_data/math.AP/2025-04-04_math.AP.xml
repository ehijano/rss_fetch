      <title>Target Signatures for Anisotropic Screens in Electromagnetic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic thin sheets of materials possess intriguing properties because of their ability to modify the phase, amplitude and polarization of incident waves. Such sheets are usually modeled by imposing transmission conditions of resistive or conductive type on a surface called a screen. We start by analyzing this model, and show that the standard passivity conditions can be slightly strengthened to provide conditions under which the forward scattering problem has a unique solution. We then turn to the inverse problem and suggest a target signature for monitoring such films. The target signature is based on a modified far field equation obtained by subtracting an artificial far field operator for scattering by a closed surface containing the thin sheet and parametrized by an artificial impedance. We show that this impedance gives rise to an interior eigenvalue problem, and these eigenvalues can be determined from the far field pattern, so functioning as target signatures. We prove uniqueness for the inverse problem, and give preliminary numerical examples illustrating our theory.</description>

      <title>The global attractor of the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation in a gravity field for Maxwell molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the linear inelastic Boltzmann equation in presence of a uniform and fixed gravity field, in the case of Maxwell molecules. We first obtain a well-posedness result in the space of finite, non-negative Radon measures. In addition, we rigorously prove the existence of a stationary solution under the non-equilibrium condition which is induced by the presence of the external field. We further show that this stationary solution is unique in the class of the finite, non-negative Radon measures with finite first order moment, and that all the solutions in this class converge towards the stationary solution in the weak topology of the measures.</description>

      <title>Mean oscillation conditions for nonlinear equation and regularity results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider general nonlinear elliptic equations of the form \[ \mathrm{div}\, A(x,Du) = 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega, \] where $ A:\Omega \times \Rn \to \Rn $ satisfies a quasi-isotropic $(p,q)$-growth condition, which is equivalent to the point-wise uniform ellipticity of $A$. We establish sharp and comprehensive mean oscillation conditions on $A(x,\xi)$ with respect to the $x$ variable to obtain $C^1$- and $W^{1,s}$-regularity results. The results provide new conditions even in the standard $p$-growth case with coefficient $\div(a(x)|Du|^{p-2}Du)=0$. Also included are variable exponent growth with and without perturbation as well as borderline double-phase growth and double-phase growth with a coefficient.</description>

      <title>Multiple existence and qualitative property of nodal solutions for coupled elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies nodal solutions having prescribed componentwise nodal data for the following coupled nonlinear elliptic equations \begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -{\Delta}u_{j}+ u_{j}= u^{3}_{j}+\beta\sum_{i=1, i\neq j}^N u_{j}u_{i}^{2} \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \mbox{in}\ \Omega,\nonumber
  u_{j}\in H_{0,r}^{1}(\Omega), \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,j=1,\dots,N.\nonumber
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation} Here, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded and radial domain with $n=2,3$. The coupling constant $\beta\leq-1$ is in the repulsive regime. We investigate the solution structure for both positive and nodal solutions, proving multiple existence of solutions with prescribed nodal data and providing qualitative estimates for the nodal numbers of the inter-componentwise differences of solutions with both upper and lower bounds. Our general framework is for nodal solutions though our results are new also for positive solutions.</description>

      <title>The model example of wave equation with oscillating scale-invariant damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a simple example of wave equation with a time-dependent damping term, whose coefficient decays at infinity at the scale-invariant rate and includes an oscillatory component that is integrable but not absolutely integrable.
  We show that the oscillations in the damping coefficient induce a resonance effect with a fundamental solution of the elastic term, altering the energy decay rate of solutions. In particular, some solutions exhibit slower decay compared to the case without the oscillatory component.
  Our proof relies on Fourier analysis and a representation of solutions in polar coordinates, reducing the problem to a detailed study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a family of ordinary differential equations and suitable oscillatory integrals.</description>

      <title>Iterative blow-ups for maps with bounded $\mathcal{A}$-variation: a refinement, with application to $\mathrm{BD}$ and $\mathrm{BV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine the iterated blow-up techniques. This technique, combined with a rigidity result and a specific choice of the kernel projection in the Poincar\'e inequality, might be employed to completely linearize blow-ups along at least one sequence. We show how to implement such argument by applying it to derive affine blow-up limits for $\mathrm{BD}$ and $\mathrm{BV}$ functions around Cantor points. In doing so we identify a specific subset of points - called totally singular points having blow-ups with completely singular gradient measure $D p=D^s p$, $\mathcal{E} p=\mathcal{E}^s p$ - at which such linearization fails.</description>

      <title>Statistical parameter identification of mixed-mode patterns from a single experimental snapshot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter identification in pattern formation models from a single experimental snapshot is challenging, as traditional methods often require knowledge of initial conditions or transient dynamics -- data that are frequently unavailable in experimental settings. In this study, we extend the recently developed statistical approach, Correlation Integral Likelihood (CIL) method to enable robust parameter identification from a single snapshot of an experimental pattern. Using the chlorite-iodite-malonic acid (CIMA) reaction -- a well-studied system that produces Turing patterns -- as a test case, we address key experimental challenges such as measurement noise, model-data discrepancies, and the presence of mixed-mode patterns, where different spatial structures (e.g., coexisting stripes and dots) emerge under the same conditions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method accurately estimates model parameters, even with incomplete or noisy data. This approach lays the groundwork for future applications in developmental biology, chemical reaction modelling, and other systems with heterogeneous output.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of sequences of integral functionals depending on moving anisotropies. We introduce and describe the relevant functional setting, establishing uniform Meyers-Serrin type approximations, Poincar\'e inequalities and compactness properties. We prove several $\Gamma$-convergence results, and apply the latter to the study of $H$-convergence of anisotropic linear differential operators.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for time-dependent Signorini problems in linearised viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of solutions for time-dependent linearly viscoelastic bodies confined to a specified half-space. The confinement condition under consideration is of Signorini type, and is given over the boundary of the linearly viscoelastic body under consideration. In order to derive a suitable notion of solution that possesses a sufficient degree of regularity, we introduce the concept of ``admissible'' applied body force. In agreement with expectations, the variational problem that solutions must satisfy is a system of hyperbolic variational inequalities, and the displacement acceleration is a vector-valued measure in the sense of Dinculeanu.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of the Symmetry Group of $L_p$-Minkowski Problem on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Convex Geometry, a core topic is the $L_p$-Minkowski problem
  \begin{equation}\label{e0.1}
  \det(\nabla^2h+hI)=fh^{p-1}, \ \ \forall X\in{\mathbb{S}}^n, \ \ \forall p\in \mathbb{R}
  \end{equation} of Monge-Amp\`{e}re type. By the transformation $u(x)=h(X)\sqrt{1+|x|^2}$ and semi-spherical projection, equation \eqref{e0.1} can be reformulated by the Monge-Amp\`{e}re type equation
  \begin{equation}\label{e0.2}
  \det D^2u=(1+|x|^2)^{-\frac{p+n+1}{2}}u^{p-1}, \ \ \forall x\in{\mathbb{R}}^n, \ \ \forall p\in \mathbb{R}
  \end{equation} on the Euclidean space. In this paper, we will firstly determine the symmetric groups of $n$-dimensional fully nonlinear equation \eqref{e0.2} without asymptotic growth assumption. After proving several key resolution lemmas, we thus completely classify the symmetric groups of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem. Our method develops the Lie theory to fully nonlinear PDEs in Convex Geometry.</description>

      <title>Stability threshold for two-dimensional Boussinesq systems near-Couette shear flow in a finite channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability threshold problem of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes Boussinesq equations in a finite channel $ \T \times [-1,1]$, focusing on the stability around the near Couette shear flow $ (U(y), 0)$, assuming the Navier slip boundary conditions are satisfied. In particular, when the initial data for the vorticity resides in an anisotropic Sobolev space of size $ O(\min \{ \mu^{\frac{1}{2}}, \nu^{\frac{1}{2}}\})$, and the initial perturbation of the temperature resides in an anisotropic Sobolev space of size $ O(\min \{ \mu, \nu\})$, we derive the nonlinear enhanced dissipation effect and the inviscid damping effect for the NSB system.</description>

      <title>Inner-layer asymptotics in partially perforated domains: coupling across flat and oscillating interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article examines a boundary-value problem in a domain consisting of perforated and imperforate regions, with Neumann conditions prescribed at
  the boundaries of the perforations. Assuming the porous medium has symmetric, periodic structure with a small period $\varepsilon,$ we analyse the limit behavior of the problem as $\varepsilon \to 0.$ A crucial aspect of this study is deriving correct coupling conditions at the common interface, which is achieved using inner-layer asymptotics. For the flat interface, we construct and justify a complete asymptotic expansion of the solution in the $H^1$-Sobolev space. Furthermore, for the $\varepsilon$-periodically oscillating interface of amplitude $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon),$ we provide an approximation to the solution and establish the corresponding asymptotic estimates in $H^1$-Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Spectral asymmetry via pseudodifferential projections: the massless Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on closed manifolds was proposed in a recent series of papers by the first author and collaborator. They showed that information on spectral asymmetry can be encoded within and recovered from a negative order pseudodifferential operator -- the asymmetry operator -- constructed from appropriately defined pseudodifferential (spectral) projections. In this manuscript we apply these techniques to the study of the massless Dirac operator; in particular, we compute the principal symbol of the asymmetry operator, accounting for the underlying gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ricci flow and long-time existence of Harmonic map heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an ancient Ricci flow asymptotic to a compact integrable shrinker, or a Ricci flow developing a finite-time singularity modelled on the shrinker, we establish the long-time existence of a harmonic map heat flow between the Ricci flow and the shrinker for all times. This provides a global parabolic gauge for the Ricci flow and implies the uniqueness of the tangent flow without modulo any diffeomorphisms.
  We present two main applications: First, we construct and classify all ancient Ricci flows asymptotic to any compact integrable shrinker, showing that they converge exponentially. Second, we obtain the optimal convergence rate at singularities modelled on the shrinker, characterized by the first negative eigenvalue of the stability operator for the entropy. In particular, we show that any Ricci flow developing a round $\mathbb S^n$ singularity converges at least at the rate $(-t)^{\frac{n+1}{n-1}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an area-minimizing integral current of dimension $m$ and codimension at least $2$ and fix an arbitrary interior singular point $q$ where at least one tangent cone is flat. For any vanishing sequence of scales around $q$ along which the rescaled currents converge to a flat cone, we define a suitable singularity degree of the rescalings, which is a real number bigger than or equal to $1$. We show that this number is independent of the chosen sequence and we prove several interesting properties linked to its value. Our study prepares the ground for two companion works, where we show that the singular set is $(m-2)$-rectifiable and the tangent cone is unique at $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-a.e. point.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. In the first part we focus on a functional involving a weighted curvature integral and the quermassintegrals. We prove upper and lower bounds for this functional in the class of convex sets, which provide a stronger form of the classical Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequality involving the $(n-1)$ and $(n-2)$-quermassintegrals, and consequently a stronger form of the classical isoperimetric inequality in the planar case. Moreover, quantitative estimates are proved. In the second part we deal with a shape optimization problem for a functional involving the boundary momentum. It is known that in dimension two the ball is a maximizer among simply connected sets when the perimeter and centroid is fixed. We show that the result still holds in the class of undecomposable sets. In higher dimensions the same result does not hold and we consider a new scaling invariant functional that might be a good candidate to generalize the planar case. For this functional we prove that the ball is a stable maximizer in the class of nearly spherical sets in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetrizations and uniqueness of solutions to nonlocal equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that nonlocal seminorms are strictly decreasing under the continuous Steiner rearrangement. This implies that all solutions to nonlocal equations which arise as critical points of nonlocal energies are radially symmetric and decreasing. Moreover, we show uniqueness of solutions by exploiting the convexity of the energies under a tailored interpolation in the space of radially symmetric and decreasing functions. As an application, we consider the long time dynamics of a higher order nonlocal equation which models the growth of symmetric cracks in an elastic medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat some classes of linear and semilinear stochastic partial differential equations of Schr\"odinger type on $\mathbb{R}^d$, involving a non-flat Laplacian, within the framework of white noise analysis, combined with Wiener-It\^o chaos expansions and pseudodifferential operator methods. The initial data and potential term of the Schr\"odinger operator are assumed to be generalized stochastic processes that have spatial dependence. We prove that the equations under consideration have unique solutions in the appropriate (intersections of weighted) Sobolev-Kato-Kondratiev spaces.</description>

      <title>Behavior of Absorbing and Generating $p$-Robin Eigenvalues in Bounded and Exterior Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish rigorous quantitative inequalities for the first eigenvalue of the generalized $p$-Robin problem, for both the classical diffusion absorption case, where the Robin boundary parameter $\alpha$ is positive, and the superconducting generation regime ($\alpha&lt;0$), where the boundary acts as a source. In bounded domains, we use a unified approach to derive a precise asymptotic behavior for all $p$ and all small real $\alpha$, improving existing results in various directions, including requiring weaker boundary regularity for the case of the classical 2-Robin problem, studied in the fundamental work by Ren\'e Sperb. In exterior domains, we characterize the existence of eigenvalues, establish general inequalities and asymptotics as $\alpha\to 0$ for the first eigenvalue of the exterior of a ball, and obtain some sharp geometric inequalities for convex domains in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and linearization for a semilinear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the initial value problem for a defocusing semi-linear wave equation with spatially growing nonlinearity. By employing Moser-Trudinger type inequalities and Strichartz estimates, we establish global well-posedness in the energy space for radially symmetric initial data. Additionally, we derive the linearization of energy-bounded solutions. The main challenge in our analysis arises from the spatial growth of the nonlinearity at infinity, which prevents the direct application of Sobolev embeddings or Hardy inequalities to control the potential energy. The main novelty in this work lies in overcoming this challenge within the radial framework through the combined application of the Strauss inequality and Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e. the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.</description>

Abstract: We study the hypoellipticity and solvability properties of a class of time-periodic evolution operators, with coefficients globally defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and growing polynomially with respect to the space variable. To this aim, we introduce a class of time-periodic weighted Sobolev spaces, whose elements are characterised in terms of suitable Fourier expansions, associated with elliptic operators.</description>

      <title>Flag Hardy space theory on Heisenberg groups and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.07371v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a complete theory of the flag Hardy space on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb H^{n}$ with characterisations via atomic decompositions, area functions, square functions, maximal functions and singular integrals. We introduce several new techniques to overcome the difficulties caused by the noncommutative Heisenberg group multiplication, and the lack of a suitable Fourier transformation and Cauchy--Riemann type equations. Applications include the boundedness from the flag Hardy space to $L^1(\mathbb H^n)$ of various singular integral operators that arise in complex analysis, a sharp boundedness result on the flag Hardy space of the Marcinkiewicz-type multipliers introduced by M\"uller, Ricci and Stein, and the decomposition of flag BMO space via singular integrals.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving nonhomogeneous Gauss curvature flow in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the volume preserving flow of smooth, closed and convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ with speed given by a general nonhomogeneous function of the Gauss curvature. For a large class of speed functions, we prove that the solution of the flow remains convex, exists for all positive time $t\in [0,\infty)$ and converges to a geodesic sphere exponentially as $t\to\infty$ in the smooth topology. A key step is to show the $L^1$ oscillation decay of the Gauss curvature to its average along a subsequence of times going to the infinity, which combined with an argument using the hyperbolic curvature measure theory implies the Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>
