      <title>SurgPub-Video: A Comprehensive Surgical Video Dataset for Enhanced Surgical Intelligence in Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant potential in surgical scene analysis, yet existing models are limited by frame-level datasets and lack high-quality video data with procedural surgical knowledge. To address these challenges, we make the following contributions: (i) SurgPub-Video, a comprehensive dataset of over 3,000 surgical videos and 25 million annotated frames across 11 specialties, sourced from peer-reviewed clinical journals, (ii) SurgLLaVA-Video, a specialized VLM for surgical video understanding, built upon the TinyLLaVA-Video architecture that supports both video-level and frame-level inputs, and (iii) a video-level surgical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark, covering diverse 11 surgical specialities, such as vascular, cardiology, and thoracic. Extensive experiments, conducted on the proposed benchmark and three additional surgical downstream tasks (action recognition, skill assessment, and triplet recognition), show that SurgLLaVA-Video significantly outperforms both general-purpose and surgical-specific VLMs with only three billion parameters. The dataset, model, and benchmark will be released to enable further advancements in surgical video understanding.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Bayesian Optimization in Bioprocess Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization has become widely popular across various experimental sciences due to its favorable attributes: it can handle noisy data, perform well with relatively small datasets, and provide adaptive suggestions for sequential experimentation. While still in its infancy, Bayesian optimization has recently gained traction in bioprocess engineering. However, experimentation with biological systems is highly complex and the resulting experimental uncertainty requires specific extensions to classical Bayesian optimization. Moreover, current literature often targets readers with a strong statistical background, limiting its accessibility for practitioners.
  In light of these developments, this review has two aims: first, to provide an intuitive and practical introduction to Bayesian optimization; and second, to outline promising application areas and open algorithmic challenges, thereby highlighting opportunities for future research in machine learning.</description>
