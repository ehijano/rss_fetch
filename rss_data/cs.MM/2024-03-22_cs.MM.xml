      <title>Bringing Robots Home: The Rise of AI Robots in Consumer Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On March 18, 2024, NVIDIA unveiled Project GR00T, a general-purpose multimodal generative AI model designed specifically for training humanoid robots. Preceding this event, Tesla's unveiling of the Optimus Gen 2 humanoid robot on December 12, 2023, underscored the profound impact robotics is poised to have on reshaping various facets of our daily lives. While robots have long dominated industrial settings, their presence within our homes is a burgeoning phenomenon. This can be attributed, in part, to the complexities of domestic environments and the challenges of creating robots that can seamlessly integrate into our daily routines.</description>

      <title>AnyV2V: A Plug-and-Play Framework For Any Video-to-Video Editing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-to-video editing involves editing a source video along with additional control (such as text prompts, subjects, or styles) to generate a new video that aligns with the source video and the provided control. Traditional methods have been constrained to certain editing types, limiting their ability to meet the wide range of user demands. In this paper, we introduce AnyV2V, a novel training-free framework designed to simplify video editing into two primary steps: (1) employing an off-the-shelf image editing model (e.g. InstructPix2Pix, InstantID, etc) to modify the first frame, (2) utilizing an existing image-to-video generation model (e.g. I2VGen-XL) for DDIM inversion and feature injection. In the first stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image editing tools to support an extensive array of video editing tasks. Beyond the traditional prompt-based editing methods, AnyV2V also can support novel video editing tasks, including reference-based style transfer, subject-driven editing, and identity manipulation, which were unattainable by previous methods. In the second stage, AnyV2V can plug in any existing image-to-video models to perform DDIM inversion and intermediate feature injection to maintain the appearance and motion consistency with the source video. On the prompt-based editing, we show that AnyV2V can outperform the previous best approach by 35\% on prompt alignment, and 25\% on human preference. On the three novel tasks, we show that AnyV2V also achieves a high success rate. We believe AnyV2V will continue to thrive due to its ability to seamlessly integrate the fast-evolving image editing methods. Such compatibility can help AnyV2V to increase its versatility to cater to diverse user demands.</description>

      <title>M3FAS: An Accurate and Robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Face presentation attacks (FPA), also known as face spoofing, have brought increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to overcome the issues above. The primary innovation of this work lies in the following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and auditory modalities using three commonly available sensors: camera, speaker, and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion; (3). We propose a multi-head training strategy, allowing the model to output predictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, resulting in a more flexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness, and flexibility of M3FAS under various challenging experimental settings.

      <title>Deep Bi-directional Attention Network for Image Super-Resolution Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has emerged a growing interest in exploring efficient quality assessment algorithms for image super-resolution (SR). However, employing deep learning techniques, especially dual-branch algorithms, to automatically evaluate the visual quality of SR images remains challenging. Existing SR image quality assessment (IQA) metrics based on two-stream networks lack interactions between branches. To address this, we propose a novel full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) method for SR images. Specifically, producing SR images and evaluating how close the SR images are to the corresponding HR references are separate processes. Based on this consideration, we construct a deep Bi-directional Attention Network (BiAtten-Net) that dynamically deepens visual attention to distortions in both processes, which aligns well with the human visual system (HVS). Experiments on public SR quality databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BiAtten-Net over state-of-the-art quality assessment methods. In addition, the visualization results and ablation study show the effectiveness of bi-directional attention.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Cooperation via Fine-grained Modality Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One primary topic of multimodal learning is to jointly incorporate heterogeneous information from different modalities. However, most models often suffer from unsatisfactory multimodal cooperation, which cannot jointly utilize all modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the worse learnt modality, but they are often hard to provide the fine-grained observation of multimodal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support. Hence, it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained cooperation between modalities, especially when facing realistic scenarios where the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this end, we introduce a sample-level modality valuation metric to evaluate the contribution of each modality for each sample. Via modality valuation, we observe that modality discrepancy indeed could be different at sample-level, beyond the global contribution discrepancy at dataset-level. We further analyze this issue and improve cooperation between modalities at sample-level by enhancing the discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a targeted manner. Overall, our methods reasonably observe the fine-grained uni-modal contribution and achieve considerable improvement.
