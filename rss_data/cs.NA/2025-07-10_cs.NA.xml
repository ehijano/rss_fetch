      <title>A Family of Block-Centered Schemes for Contaminant Transport Equations with Adsorption via Integral Method with Variational Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a class of high-order conservative schemes for contaminant transport with equilibrium adsorption, based on the Integral Method with Variational Limit on block-centered grids. By incorporating four parameters, the scheme can reproduce classical fourth-order compact schemes and further extend to sixth- and eighth-order accurate formulations, all within a unified framework. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analyze the stability, convergence, and mass conservation of the parameterized numerical scheme. Numerical experiments are then conducted to examine the impact of parameter variations on errors, explore the relationship between parameters and the fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order schemes, and verify that the schemes' high-order accuracy aligns with theoretical predictions. To enhance the applicability of the proposed method, we further develop two fourth-order compact boundary treatments that ensure uniform accuracy between boundary and interior regions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed schemes across various adsorption models.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Approximation as a Bias-Reducing Strategy for Scalar and Manifold-Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bias-variance tradeoff within a multiscale approximation framework. Our approach utilizes a given quasi-approximation operator, repeatedly applied in an error-correction scheme over a hierarchical data structure. We introduce a new bias measurement, the bias ratio, to quantitatively assess the improvements made by multiscale approximations and demonstrate that this multiscale strategy effectively reduces the bias component of the approximation error, thereby providing a more flexible and robust framework for addressing scattered data approximation problems. Our findings exhibit consistent bias decay across various scenarios, including applications to manifold-valued functions.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Greedy Approximation of Parametric Elliptic Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently introduced a scale of kernel-based greedy schemes for approximating the solutions of elliptic boundary value problems. The procedure is based on a generalized interpolation framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and was coined PDE-$\beta$-greedy procedure, where the parameter $\beta \geq 0$ is used in a greedy selection criterion and steers the degree of function adaptivity. Algebraic convergence rates have been obtained for Sobolev-space kernels and solutions of finite smoothness. We now report a result of exponential convergence rates for the case of infinitely smooth kernels and solutions. We furthermore extend the approximation scheme to the case of parametric PDEs by the use of state-parameter product kernels. In the surrogate modelling context, the resulting approach can be interpreted as an a priori model reduction approach, as no solution snapshots need to be precomputed. Numerical results show the efficiency of the approximation procedure for problems which occur as challenges for other parametric MOR procedures: non-affine geometry parametrizations, moving sources or high-dimensional domains.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Interface Problem approximated by CutFEM: II. A posteriori error analysis based on equilibrated fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an elliptic interface problem with discontinuous diffusion coefficients on unfitted meshes, employing the CutFEM method. The main contribution is the a posteriori error analysis based on equilibrated fluxes belonging to the immersed Raviart-Thomas space. We establish sharp reliability and local efficiency of a new error estimator, which includes both volume and interface terms, carefully tracking the dependence of the efficiency constant on the diffusion coefficients and the mesh/interface configuration. Numerical results highlight the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Sharp uniform approximation for spectral Barron functions by deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the neural network approximation capabilities for functions within the spectral Barron space $\mathscr{B}^s$, where $s$ is the smoothness index. We demonstrate that for functions in $\mathscr{B}^{1/2}$, a shallow neural network (a single hidden layer) with $N$ units can achieve an $L^p$-approximation rate of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$. This rate also applies to uniform approximation, differing by at most a logarithmic factor. Our results significantly reduce the smoothness requirement compared to existing theory, which necessitate functions to belong to $\mathscr{B}^1$ in order to attain the same rate. Furthermore, we show that increasing the network's depth can notably improve the approximation order for functions with small smoothness. Specifically, for networks with $L$ hidden layers, functions in $\mathscr{B}^s$ with $0 &lt; sL \le 1/2$ can achieve an approximation rate of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-sL})$. The rates and prefactors in our estimates are dimension-free. We also confirm the sharpness of our findings, with the lower bound closely aligning with the upper, with a discrepancy of at most one logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for a $C^1$ virtual element method applied to the thin plate vibration problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyse residual-based a posteriori error estimates for the virtual element discretisation applied to the thin plate vibration problem in both two and three dimensions. Our approach involves a conforming $C^1$ discrete formulation suitable for meshes composed of polygons and polyhedra. The reliability and efficiency of the error estimator are established through a dimension-independent proof. Finally, several numerical experiments are reported to demonstrate the optimal performance of the method in 2D and 3D.</description>

      <title>An overlapping domain decomposition method for parametric Stokes and Stokes-Darcy problems via proper generalized decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strategy to construct physics-based local surrogate models for parametric Stokes flows and coupled Stokes-Darcy systems is presented. The methodology relies on the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) method to reduce the dimensionality of the parametric flow fields and on an overlapping domain decomposition (DD) paradigm to reduce the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in space. The DD-PGD approach provides a non-intrusive framework in which end-users only need access to the matrices arising from the (finite element) discretization of the full-order problems in the subdomains. The traces of the finite element functions used for the discretization within the subdomains are employed to impose arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions at the interface, without introducing auxiliary basis functions. The methodology is seamless to the choice of the discretization schemes in space, being compatible with both LBB-compliant finite element pairs and stabilized formulations, and the DD-PGD paradigm is transparent to the employed overlapping DD approach. The local surrogate models are glued together in the online phase by solving a parametric interface system to impose continuity of the subdomain solutions at the interfaces, without introducing Lagrange multipliers to enforce the continuity in the entire overlap and without solving any additional physical problem in the reduced space. Numerical results are presented for parametric single-physics (Stokes-Stokes) and multi-physics (Stokes-Darcy) systems, showcasing the accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of DD-PGD, and its capability to outperform DD methods based on high-fidelity finite element solvers in terms of computing times.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving space discretization of differential and nonlocal constitutive relations for port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure-preserving space discretization of port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems defined with differential constitutive relations. Using the concept of Stokes-Lagrange structure to describe these relations, these are reduced to a finite-dimensional Lagrange subspace of a pH system thanks to a structure-preserving Finite Element Method.
  To illustrate our results, the 1D nanorod case and the shear beam model are considered, which are given by differential and implicit constitutive relations for which a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with boundary energy ports naturally occur.
  Then, these results are extended to the nonlinear 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations written in a vorticity-stream function formulation. It is first recast as a pH system defined with a Stokes-Lagrange structure along with a modulated Stokes-Dirac structure. A careful structure-preserving space discretization is then performed, leading to a finite-dimensional pH system. Theoretical and numerical results show that both enstrophy and kinetic energy evolutions are preserved both at the semi-discrete and fully-discrete levels.</description>

      <title>A new class of one-step A-stable and L-stable schemes of high-order accuracy for parabolic type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new class of BDF schemes proposed in [F. Huang and J. Shen, SIAM J Numer. Anal., 62.4, 1609--1637] for the parabolic type equations are studied in this paper. The basic idea is based on the Taylor expansions at time $t^{n+\beta}$ with $\beta&gt;1$ being a tunable parameter. These new BDF schemes allow larger time steps at higher order r for stiff problems than that which allowed with a usual higher-order scheme. However, multi-step methods like BDF exhibit inherent disadvantages relative to one-step methods in practical implementations. In this paper, inspired by their excellent work, we construct a new class of high-order one-step schemes for linear parabolic-type equations. These new schemes, with several suitable $\beta_i$, can achieve A-stable, or even L-stable. Specially, the new scheme with special parameters $\beta_i$ can be regarded as the classical one-step Runge-Kutta scheme with a stabilized term. Besides, we provide two different techniques to construct the one-step high-order schemes: the first one is by choosing different parameters $\beta_i$, and the second one is by increasing the number of intermediate layers. Both methods have been proven to be highly effective and even exhibit superconvergence property. Finally, we also conducted several numerical experiments to support our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate evaluation of Biot-Savart integrals over spatial curves in periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07366v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Biot-Savart law is relevant in physical contexts including electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. In the latter case, when the rotation of a fluid is confined to a set of very thin vortex filaments, this law describes the velocity field induced by the spatial arrangement of these objects. The Biot-Savart law is at the core of vortex methods used in the simulation of classical and quantum fluid flows. Naive methods are inefficient when dealing with large numbers of vortex elements, which makes them inadequate for simulating turbulent vortex flows. Here we exploit a direct analogy between the Biot-Savart law and electrostatics to adapt Ewald summation methods, routinely used in molecular dynamics simulations, to vortex filament simulations in three-dimensional periodic domains. In this context, the basic idea is to split the induced velocity onto (i) a coarse-grained velocity generated by a Gaussian-filtered vorticity field, and (ii) a short-range correction accounting for near-singular behaviour near the vortices. The former component can be accurately and efficiently evaluated using the nonuniform fast Fourier transform algorithm. Analytical accuracy estimates are provided as a function of the parameters entering the method. We also discuss how to properly account for the finite vortex core size in kinetic energy estimations. Using numerical experiments, we verify the accuracy and the conservation properties of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate the $O(N \log N)$ complexity of the method over a wide range of problem sizes $N$, considerably better than the $O(N^2)$ cost of a naive approach.</description>

      <title>Magneto-radiative modelling and artificial neural network optimization of biofluid flow in a stenosed arterial domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.</description>

      <title>Neural Actor-Critic Methods for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs: Asymptotic Analysis and Numerical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We mathematically analyze and numerically study an actor-critic machine learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equations from stochastic control theory. The architecture of the critic (the estimator for the value function) is structured so that the boundary condition is always perfectly satisfied (rather than being included in the training loss) and utilizes a biased gradient which reduces computational cost. The actor (the estimator for the optimal control) is trained by minimizing the integral of the Hamiltonian over the domain, where the Hamiltonian is estimated using the critic. We show that the training dynamics of the actor and critic neural networks converge in a Sobolev-type space to a certain infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of hidden units in the actor and critic $\rightarrow \infty$. Further, under a convexity-like assumption on the Hamiltonian, we prove that any fixed point of this limit ODE is a solution of the original stochastic control problem. This provides an important guarantee for the algorithm's performance in light of the fact that finite-width neural networks may only converge to a local minimizers (and not optimal solutions) due to the non-convexity of their loss functions. In our numerical studies, we demonstrate that the algorithm can solve stochastic control problems accurately in up to 200 dimensions. In particular, we construct a series of increasingly complex stochastic control problems with known analytic solutions and study the algorithm's numerical performance on them. These problems range from a linear-quadratic regulator equation to highly challenging equations with non-convex Hamiltonians, allowing us to identify and analyze the strengths and limitations of this neural actor-critic method for solving HJB equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data. This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the stability of an immersed elastic surface using the method of regularized Stokeslets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear stability analysis of an elastic surface immersed in a viscous fluid is presented. The coupled system is modeled using the method of regularized Stokeslets (MRS), a Lagrangian method for simulating fluid-structure interaction at zero Reynolds number. The linearized system is solved in a doubly periodic domain in a 3D fluid. The eigenvalues determine the theoretical critical time step for numerical stability for a forward Euler time integration, which are then verified numerically across several regularization functions, elastic models, and parameter choices. New doubly periodic regularized Stokeslets are presented, allowing for comparison of the stability properties of different regularization functions. The stability results for a common regularization function are approximated by a power law relating the regularization parameter and the surface discretization for two different elastic models. This relationship is empirically shown to hold in the different setting of a finite surface in a bulk fluid.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the tangential control of the Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.08522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an unconstrained tangential Dirichlet boundary control problem for the Stokes equations with an $ L^2 $ penalty on the boundary control. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we obtain well-posedness and regularity results for the tangential Dirichlet control problem on a convex polygonal domain. The analysis contains new features not found in similar Dirichlet control problems for the Poisson equation; an interesting result is that the optimal control has higher local regularity on the individual edges of the domain compared to the global regularity on the entire boundary. Second, we propose and analyze a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution. For convex polygonal domains, our theoretical convergence rate for the control is optimal with respect to the global regularity on the entire boundary. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the HDG method.</description>

      <title>Active Learning Based Sampling for High-Dimensional Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deep-learning-based least squares method has shown successful results in solving high-dimensional non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, this method usually converges slowly. To speed up the convergence of this approach, an active-learning-based sampling algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm actively chooses the most informative training samples from a probability density function based on residual errors to facilitate error reduction. In particular, points with larger residual errors will have more chances of being selected for training. This algorithm imitates the human learning process: learners are likely to spend more time repeatedly studying mistakes than other tasks they have correctly finished. A series of numerical results are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our active-learning-based sampling in high dimensions to speed up the convergence of the deep-learning-based least squares method.</description>

      <title>On the Stability and Convergence of Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks is a numerical method which uses neural networks to approximate solutions of partial differential equations. It has received a lot of attention and is currently used in numerous physical and engineering problems. The mathematical understanding of these methods is limited, and in particular, it seems that, a consistent notion of stability is missing. Towards addressing this issue we consider model problems of partial differential equations, namely linear elliptic and parabolic PDEs. Motivated by tools of nonlinear calculus of variations we systematically show that coercivity of the energies and associated compactness provide a consistent framework for stability. For time discrete training we show that if these properties fail to hold then methods may become unstable. Furthermore, using tools of $\Gamma$- convergence we provide new convergence results for weak solutions by only requiring that the neural network spaces are chosen to have suitable approximation properties. While our analysis is motivated by neural network-based approximation spaces, the framework developed here is applicable to any class of discrete functions satisfying the relevant approximation properties, and hence may serve as a foundation for the broader study of variational nonlinear PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>A sparse hierarchical $hp$-finite element method on disks and annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a sparse hierarchical $hp$-finite element method ($hp$-FEM) for the Helmholtz equation with variable coefficients posed on a two-dimensional disk or annulus. The mesh is an inner disk cell (omitted if on an annulus domain) and concentric annuli cells. The discretization preserves the Fourier mode decoupling of rotationally invariant operators, such as the Laplacian, which manifests as block diagonal mass and stiffness matrices. Moreover, the matrices have a sparsity pattern independent of the order of the discretization and admit an optimal complexity factorization. The sparse $hp$-FEM can handle radial discontinuities in the right-hand side and in rotationally invariant Helmholtz coefficients. Rotationally anisotropic coefficients that are approximated by low-degree polynomials in Cartesian coordinates also result in sparse linear systems. We consider examples such as a high-frequency Helmholtz equation with radial discontinuities and rotationally anisotropic coefficients, singular source terms, the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, and an extension to a three-dimensional cylinder domain, with a quasi-optimal solve, via the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on a mathematical model for water flow in porous media with competition between transport and diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contribution deals with the mathematical modelling of fluid flow in porous media, in particular water flow in soils, with the aim of describing the competition between transport and diffusion. The analysis is based on a mathematical model developed by B. Detmann, C. Gavioli, and P. Krej\v{c}\'i, in which the effects of gravity are included in a novel way. The model consists of a nonlinear partial differential equation describing both the diffusion and the gravitational transport of water. Although analytical solutions can be obtained for some special cases, only numerical solutions are available in more general situations. The solving algorithm is based on a time discretisation and the finite element method, and is written in Matlab. The results of the numerical simulations are shown and the behaviour of the model is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Backward error (BE) analysis emerges as a powerful tool for assessing the backward stability and strong backward stability of numerical algorithms. In this paper, we explore structured BEs for a class of double saddle point problems (DSPPs), aiming to assess the strong backward stability of numerical algorithms devised to find their solution. Our investigations preserve the inherent matrix structure and sparsity pattern in the corresponding perturbation matrices and derive explicit formulae for the structure BEs. Moreover, we provide formulae for the structure-preserving minimal perturbation matrices for which the structured BE is attained. Utilizing the relationship between the DSPP and the least squares problem with equality constraints (LSE), we derive the sparsity-preserving BE formula for LSE within our framework. Numerical experiments are performed to test the strong backward stability of various numerical algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a periodic model from a one dimensional nonlocal eikonal equation set on the full space modeling dislocation dynamics. Thanks to a gradient entropy estimate, we show that this periodic model converges toward the initial one when the period goes to infinity. Moreover, we design a semi-explicit numerical scheme for the periodic model that we introduce. We show the well-posedness of the scheme and a discrete gradient entropy inequality. We also prove the convergence of the scheme and we present some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A localized consensus-based sampling algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel interacting-particle method for sampling from non-Gaussian distributions. As a first step, we propose a new way to derive the consensus-based sampling (CBS) algorithm, starting from ensemble-preconditioned Langevin diffusions. We approximate the target potential by its Moreau envelope, such that the gradient in the Langevin equation can be replaced by a proximal operator. We then approximate the proximal operator by a weighted mean, and finally assume that the initial and target distributions are Gaussian, resulting in the CBS dynamics. If we keep only those approximations that can be justified in the non-Gaussian setting, the result is a new interacting-particle method for sampling, which we call localized consensus-based sampling. We prove that our algorithm is affine-invariant and exact for Gaussian distributions in the mean-field setting. Numerical tests illustrate that localized CBS compares favorably to alternative methods in terms of affine-invariance and performance on non-Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few years, neural network methods have evolved in various directions for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). A promising new development is the integration of neural networks with classical numerical techniques such as finite elements and finite differences. In this paper, we introduce a new class of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) trained using discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. Unlike standard collocation-based PINNs that rely on pointwise gradient evaluations and Monte Carlo quadrature, our approach computes the loss functional using finite element interpolation and integration. This avoids costly pointwise derivative computations, particularly advantageous for elliptic PDEs requiring second-order derivatives, and inherits key stability and accuracy benefits from the finite element framework. We present a convergence analysis based on variational arguments and support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments that demonstrate improved efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks for forward and inverse problems in elliptic PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network (DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum differential equation solvers: limitations and fast-forwarding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the limitations and fast-forwarding of quantum algorithms for linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems with a particular focus on non-quantum dynamics, where the coefficient matrix in the ODE is not anti-Hermitian or the ODE is inhomogeneous. On the one hand, for generic linear ODEs, by proving worst-case lower bounds, we show that quantum algorithms suffer from computational overheads due to two types of ``non-quantumness'': real part gap and non-normality of the coefficient matrix. We then show that homogeneous ODEs in the absence of both types of ``non-quantumness'' are equivalent to quantum dynamics, and reach the conclusion that quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics work best. To obtain these lower bounds, we propose a general framework for proving lower bounds on quantum algorithms that are amplifiers, meaning that they amplify the difference between a pair of input quantum states. On the other hand, we show how to fast-forward quantum algorithms for solving special classes of ODEs which leads to improved efficiency. More specifically, we obtain exponential improvements in both $T$ and the spectral norm of the coefficient matrix for inhomogeneous ODEs with efficiently implementable eigensystems, including various spatially discretized linear evolutionary partial differential equations. We give fast-forwarding algorithms that are conceptually different from existing ones in the sense that they neither require time discretization nor solving high-dimensional linear systems.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Particle Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10286v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational power of particle methods, a well-established class of algorit hms with applications in scientific computing and computer simulation. The computational power of a compute model determines the class of problems it can solve. Automata theory allows describing the computational power of abstract machines (automata) and the problems they can solve. At the top of the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages and grammars are Turing machines, which resemble the concept on which most modern computers are built. Although particle methods can be interpreted as automata based on their formal definition, their computational power has so far not been studied. We address this by analyzing Turing completeness of particle methods. In particular, we prove two sets of restrictions under which a particle method is still Turing powerful, and we show when it loses Turing powerfulness. This contributes to understanding the theoretical foundations of particle methods and provides insight into the powerfulness of computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-Negative Reduced Biquaternion Matrix Factorization with Applications in Color Face Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced biquaternion (RB), as a four-dimensional algebra highly suitable for representing color pixels, has recently garnered significant attention from numerous scholars. In this paper, for color image processing problems, we introduce a concept of the non-negative RB matrix and then use the multiplication properties of RB to propose a non-negative RB matrix factorization (NRBMF) model. The NRBMF model is introduced to address the challenge of reasonably establishing a non-negative quaternion matrix factorization model, which is primarily hindered by the multiplication properties of traditional quaternions. Furthermore, this paper transforms the problem of solving the NRBMF model into an RB alternating non-negative least squares (RB-ANNLS) problem. Then, by introducing a method to compute the gradient of the real function with RB matrix variables, we solve the RB-ANNLS optimization problem using the RB projected gradient algorithm and conduct a convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NRBMF model in color face recognition.</description>

Abstract: We develop and evaluate a method for learning solution operators to nonlinear problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach is based on a finite element discretization and aims at representing the solution operator by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that takes problem data variables as input and gives a prediction of the finite element solution as output. The variables will typically correspond to parameters in a parametrization of input data such as boundary conditions, coefficients, and right-hand sides. The output will be an approximation of the corresponding finite element solution, thus enabling support and enhancement by the standard finite element method (FEM) both theoretically and practically. The loss function is most often an energy functional and we formulate efficient parallelizable training algorithms based on assembling the energy locally on each element. For large problems, the learning process can be made more efficient by using only a small fraction of randomly chosen elements in the mesh in each iteration. The approach is evaluated on several relevant test cases, where learning the finite element solution operator turns out to be beneficial, both in its own right but also by combination with standard FEM theory and software.</description>
