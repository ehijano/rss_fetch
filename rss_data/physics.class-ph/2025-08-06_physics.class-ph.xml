      <title>Full Vectorial Maxwell Equations with Continuous Angular Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a mathematical framework for solving Maxwell's equations in cylindrical and spherical geometries with continuous angular indices. We extend beyond standard discrete harmonic decomposition to a continuous spectral representation using generalized spectral integrals, capturing electromagnetic solutions that exhibit singular behavoiur yet yield finite-energy fields at the geometric center. For continuous angular indices $\ell, m \in \mathbb{R}$, we study existence and uniqueness of solutions in weighted Sobolev spaces $H^s_{\alpha(\ell,m)}(\Omega)$ following the framework established in ~\cite{adams2003, reed1975}, prove finite energy for $\ell &gt; -\frac{1}{2}$, and construct explicit spectral kernels via biorthogonal function systems. The framework encompasses both separable cylindrical modes with continuous azimuthal index $\nu \in (0,1)$ and non-separable spherical modes where field components couple through vectorial curl operations. We present asymptotic analysis of singular field behavior, investigate convergence rates for spectral approximations, and validate the theoretical framework through Galerkin projection methods and numerical spectral integration.</description>

      <title>Connect the dots ... finding all possible orbits between two points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: You have a satellite spacecraft or asteroid that moves under the gravitational influence of a massive central body and follows a Keplerian orbit around it ellipse parabola or hyperbola Given measurements of two positions in its orbit what is the family of possible orbital paths that connects them I use the conic section orbits semilatus rectum directly related to orbital angular momentum to parameterise these orbits The solutions have applications to orbit determination ballistic missiles interplanetary interception and targeted reentry I also show how they can be applied to solve the Lambert problem of finding the unique transfer orbit that connects two points in a specified time interval These results are accessible to advanced undergraduate students in physics or aerospace engineering. Supplementary materials are provided online</description>

      <title>High-Capacity and Real-Time Acoustic Communication by Multiplexing Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic communication is indispensable for underwater networks, deep ocean exploration, and biological monitoring, environments where electromagnetic waves become impractical. However, unlike the latter, whose vector polarization naturally supports multiple information channels, acoustic waves are longitudinal and have traditionally relied almost exclusively on a single scalar pressure channel, posing a fundamental limit on their data-carrying capacity. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the vector velocity of acoustic waves can serve as a polarization-like physical degree of freedom. Using its three components as mutually independent communication channels and demodulating them with a single vector sensor, we achieve reliable, high-capacity, and real-time information transmission. Multiplexing velocity adds a new dimension to acoustic communication. When combined with other physical degrees of freedom (frequency, phase, etc.), this approach can significantly enhance the information capacity, opening new avenues for next-generation acoustic technology.</description>

      <title>Complete Integral of Primer-Vector Equations for Transfers in a Central Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the existence of a complete integral for the system of differential equations of Lawden's primer-vector, which is used in the optimization of space transfers in a central gravitational field. The derived complete integral has been shown to significantly reduce the order of the differential system for the primer-vector from sixth to second, thereby simplifying the optimization problem into a boundary value problem with four parameters. The presence of a complete integral enables the exclusion of the transversality conditions, which introduce significant complexity to the boundary value problem. The problem of transfer optimization is considerably simplified due to the existence of the full integral and generating solutions. The analysis reveals that, depending on the given constraints, there are six types of optimization problems, each corresponding to a specific boundary value problem.</description>
