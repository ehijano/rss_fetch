      <title>EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context. Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now, in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.</description>

      <title>Generation and read-out of many-body Bell correlations with a probe qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As demand for quantum technologies increases, so does the need to generate and classify non-classical correlations in complex many-body systems. We introduce a simple and versatile method for creating and certifying entanglement and many-body Bell correlations. This method relies on a single qubit interacting with an $N$-qubit system. We demonstrate that: (i) such pairwise interaction is sufficient to induce many-body quantum correlations, and (ii) the qubit can serve as a probe to extract all information about these correlations. Thus, single-qubit measurements reveal multi-partite entanglement and $N$-body Bell correlations, enabling the rapid and efficient certification of non-classicality in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli, Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local "decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models, stability of data distributions implies the existence of computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entropy-based random quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information geometry, the curvature of von-Neumann entropy and relative entropy induce a natural metric on the space of mixed quantum states. Here we use this information metric to construct a random matrix ensemble for states and investigate its key statistical properties such the eigenvalue density and probability distribution of entropy. We present an algorithm for generating these entropy-based random density matrices by sampling a class of bipartite pure states, thus providing a new recipe for random state generation that differs from the well established Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures-Hall ensemble approaches. We find that a distinguishing feature of the ensemble is its larger purity and increased volume towards the boundary of full-rank states. The entropy-based ensemble can thus be used as a uninformative prior for Bayesian quantum state tomography in high purity regimes, and as a tool for quantifying typical entanglement in finite depth quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>What is special about the Kirkwood-Dirac distributions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among all possible quasiprobability representations of quantum mechanics, the family of Kirkwood-Dirac representations has come to the foreground in recent years because of the flexibility they offer in numerous applications. This raises the question of their characterisation: what makes Kirkwood-Dirac representations special among all possible choices? We show the following. For two observables $\hat A$ and $\hat B$, consider all quasiprobability representations of quantum mechanics defined on the joint spectrum of $\hat A$ and $\hat B$, and that have the correct marginal Born probabilities for $\hat A$ and $\hat B$. For any such Born-compatible quasiprobability representation, we show that there exists, for each observable $\hat{X}$, a naturally associated conditional expectation, given $\hat B$. In addition, among the aforementioned representations, only the Kirkwood-Dirac representation has the following property: its associated conditional expectation of $\hat{X}$ given $\hat{B}$ coincides with the best predictor of $\hat{X}$ by a function of $\hat B$, for all $\hat X$.</description>

      <title>Spread and circuit complexity as a measure of particle content and phase space fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relation between different notions of quantum complexity, namely, circuit and spread complexity and physically meaningful quantities such as the particle content of the quantum state and the variances of position and momentum operators. Using a harmonic oscillator with time-dependent mass and frequency as a toy model, we show that both circuit and spread complexity at any instant is determined by the mean number of quanta and its rate of change. Furthermore, both complexity and its growth are directly linked to the variances of the position and momentum operators, providing a clear physical interpretation of complexity in terms of the state's excitation and phase-space fluctuation. Although the analysis is carried out for a single time-dependent oscillator, the results have direct relevance for quantum field theory in curved backgrounds, where individual field modes effectively behave as time-dependent oscillators. This offers new insights into how quantum complexity encodes particle production and phase space fluctuations in non-holographic systems. Finally, we establish a precise and potentially universal relation between spread and circuit complexity for the time evolved state suggesting deeper connections between different complexity measures in the context of field theories on curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Towards Continuous-variable Quantum Neural Networks for Biomedical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing offers a promising framework for scalable quantum machine learning, leveraging optical systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. While discrete-variable (DV) quantum neural networks have shown remarkable progress in various computer vision tasks, CV quantum models remain comparatively underexplored. In this work, we present a feasibility study of continuous-variable quantum neural networks (CV-QCNNs) applied to biomedical image classification. Utilizing photonic circuit simulation frameworks, we construct CV quantum circuits composed of Gaussian gates, such as displacement, squeezing, rotation, and beamsplitters to emulate convolutional behavior. Our experiments are conducted on the MedMNIST dataset collection, a set of annotated medical image benchmarks for multiple diagnostic tasks. We evaluate CV-QCNN's performance in terms of classification accuracy, model expressiveness, and resilience to Gaussian noise, comparing against classical CNNs and equivalent DV quantum circuits. This study aims to identify trade-offs between DV and CV paradigms for quantum-enhanced medical imaging. Our results highlight the potential of continuous-variable models and their viability for future computer-aided diagnosis systems.</description>

      <title>All-optical turbulence mitigation for free-space quantum key distribution using stimulated parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and demonstrate a turbulence-resilient scheme for free-space quantum communication. By leveraging the phase conjugation property of stimulated parametric down-conversion, our scheme enables all-optical dynamic correction of spatial-mode distortion induced by atmospheric turbulence, thereby enhancing the secure key rate in high-dimensional quantum key distribution. We develop a theoretical model that provides detailed guidelines for selecting the optimal basis and spatial properties needed to maximize the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Both numerical simulations and experimental results show that, even under strong turbulence, our scheme can reduce the quantum error rates well below the security threshold. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear optical approaches as powerful tools for robust quantum communication in realistic free-space environments. Our work could have important implications for the practical implementation of secure quantum channels over long free-space distances.</description>

      <title>Geometric characterization of non-Gaussian entanglement for finite stellar rank states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for the analysis of non-Gaussian entanglement in bosonic states of finite stellar rank. The central result is the full characterization of their entanglement structure through the atomic decomposition of their stellar polynomial and its associated structural graph, whose connected components determine the mode-intrinsic entanglement content of the state and all partitions compatible with passive separability. An essential ingredient in this construction is the concept of essential variables, which identify the minimal number of effective modes involved in a core state, in direct correspondence with the symplectic rank. This reduction provides the foundation for decomposing stellar polynomials into atomic factors and for revealing the underlying entanglement structure. Building on this, we derive complete separability criteria for two-mode states, expressed through hyperplane decompositions of zero sets, and for stellar-rank-2 states across arbitrary number of modes. Applications to several example states illustrate how the method isolates genuinely non-Gaussian resources and quantifies preparation complexity.</description>

      <title>ZZ-Free Two-Transmon CZ Gate Mediated by a Fluxonium Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eliminating residual ZZ interactions in a two-qubit system is essential for reducing coherent errors during quantum operations. In a superconducting circuit platform, coupling two transmon qubits via a transmon coupler has been shown to effectively suppress residual ZZ interactions. However, in such systems, perfect cancellation usually requires the qubit-qubit detuning to be smaller than the individual qubit anharmonicities, which exacerbates frequency crowding and microwave crosstalk. To address this limitation, we introduce TFT (Transmon-Fluxonium-Transmon) architecture, wherein two transmon qubits are coupled via a fluxonium qubit. The coupling mediated by the fluxonium eliminates residual ZZ interactions even for transmons detuned larger than their anharmonicities. We experimentally identified zero-ZZ interaction points at qubit-qubit detunings of 409 MHz and 616 MHz from two distinct TFT devices. We then implemented an adiabatic, coupler-flux-biased controlled-Z gate on both devices, achieving CZ gate fidelities of 99.64(6)% and 99.68(8)%.</description>

      <title>Superconducting pairing correlations on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Software for Creating Scalable Benchmarks from Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating scalable, reliable, and well-motivated benchmarks for quantum computers is challenging: straightforward approaches to benchmarking suffer from exponential scaling, are insensitive to important errors, or use poorly-motivated performance metrics. Furthermore, curated benchmarking suites cannot include every interesting quantum circuit or algorithm, which necessitates a tool that enables the easy creation of new benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a software tool for creating scalable and reliable benchmarks that measure a well-motivated performance metric (process fidelity) from user-chosen quantum circuits and algorithms. Our software, called $\texttt{scarab}$, enables the creation of efficient and robust benchmarks even from circuits containing thousands or millions of qubits, by employing efficient fidelity estimation techniques, including mirror circuit fidelity estimation and subcircuit volumetric benchmarking. $\texttt{scarab}$ provides a simple interface that enables the creation of reliable benchmarks by users who are not experts in the theory of quantum computer benchmarking or noise. We demonstrate the flexibility and power of $\texttt{scarab}$ by using it to turn existing inefficient benchmarks into efficient benchmarks, to create benchmarks that interrogate hardware and algorithmic trade-offs in Hamiltonian simulation, to quantify the in-situ efficacy of approximate circuit compilation, and to create benchmarks that use subcircuits to measure progress towards executing a circuit of interest.</description>

      <title>Preserving fermionic statistics for single-particle approximations in microscopic quantum master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic master equations have gained traction for the dissipative treatment of molecular spin and solid-state systems for quantum technologies. Single particle approximations are often invoked to treat these systems, which can lead to unphysical evolution when combined with master equation approaches. We present a mathematical constraint on the system-environment parameters to ensure that microscopically-derived Markovian master equations preserve fermionic, $N$-representable statistics when applied to reduced systems. We demonstrate these constraints for the recently derived unified master equation and universal Lindblad equation, along with the Redfield master equation for cases when positivity issues are not present. For operators that break the constraint, we explore the addition of Pauli factors to recover $N$-representability. This work promotes feasible applications of novel microscopic master equations for realistic chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Information recycling in coherent state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrimination of coherent states is a crucial component in quantum communication with continuous variables, especially in quantum key distribution protocols (CV-QKD), which rely on the ability to distinguish among different coherent states to establish a shared secret key between two parties. Here, we propose and analyze a strategy for distinguishing among N phase-symmetric coherent states, which optimally takes unambiguous discrimination (UD) to the deterministic regime, at the inevitable cost of having non-zero probability of error. Despite the disturbance introduced by the separation map used in the UD process, we show that for N &gt; 2, the "failure" states of UD retain residual information about the original input states, which can be further used for discrimination. Rather than discarding inconclusive outcomes as in conventional UD, we show that the "failure" states of UD can be optimally recycled by performing a sequential minimum-error discrimination (MED). This strategy, which we call information recycling (IR), combines the benefits of both MED and optimal UD: It always provides conclusive results while allowing for a subset of those results to be error-free, which are identifiable by an ancillary system. We characterize the disturbance introduced by the state separation map by the infidelity between input and failure states, demonstrating that it lower bounds the error probability in the recycling stage. Furthermore, in the low-amplitude regime-relevant for long-distance CV-QKD applications-we show that the state separation achieves significant success while introducing relatively low disturbance to the input states after failed events. Our results open up new possibilities for adaptive and sequential discrimination protocols in continuous-variable settings, and could potentially be used in the design of next-generation receivers in quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed double-transmon coupler scheme in scalable superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing both quantum simulation and quantum error correction. Recently, transmon qubit systems employing the single-transmon coupler (STC) scheme have demonstrated high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gate operations by dynamically tuning the effective coupling between qubits. However, the integration of STCs increases the number of control lines, thereby posing a significant bottleneck for chip routing and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a robust control line multiplexing scheme based on a double-transmon coupler (DTC) architecture, which enables shared coupler control lines to substantially reduce wiring complexity. Moreover, we experimentally verify that this multiplexed configuration efficiently suppresses undesirable static $ZZ$ coupling while maintaining accurate control over two-qubit gate operations. We further demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture through two distinct gate implementations: a fast coupler $Z$-control-based CZ gate and a parametric iSWAP gate. To validate the practical applicability of this multiplexing approach in quantum circuits, we prepare Bell and three-qubit GHZ states using the proposed scheme with fidelity exceeding 99% and 96%, respectively. This multiplexed DTC architecture offers significant potential to minimize wiring overhead in two-dimensional qubit arrays, thereby greatly enhancing the scalability of superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Localized to delocalized spatial quantum correlation evolution in structured bright twin beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the spatial domain hold great promise for applications in quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and quantum information processing, owing to the infinite dimensionality of the associated Hilbert space. Here, we present a theoretical investigation, complemented by experimental measurements, of the propagation dynamics of the spatial quantum correlations in bright structured twin beams generated via a four-wave mixing process in a double-$\Lambda$ configuration in atomic vapor. We derive an analytical expression describing the evolution of the spatial quantum correlation distribution from the near field to the far field. To qualitatively support the theoretical predictions, we perform experiments measuring intensity-difference noise between different spatial subregions of the twin beams as they propagate from the near field to the far field. The presence of quantum correlations is manifested as squeezing in the intensity difference noise measurement. With a Gaussian pump, we observe localized correlations in the near field and localized anti-correlations in the far field. In contrast, with a structured Laguerre-Gaussian pump, there is a transition from localized correlations in the near field to delocalized correlations in the far field. The present results offer valuable insights into the fundamental behavior of spatial quantum correlations and open possibilities for potential applications in quantum information, quantum imaging and sensing.</description>

      <title>Dirac delta-convergence of free-motion time-of-arrival eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous numerical analyses on the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) operator representing the quantum time-of-arrival (TOA) observable for the free particle have indicated that its eigenfunctions represent quantum states with definite arrival time at the arrival point. In this paper, we give the mathematical proof that this is indeed the case. An essential element of this proof is the consideration of the eigenfunctions of the AB operator with complex eigenvalues. These eigenfunctions can be considered legitimate TOA eigenfunctions because they evolve unitarily to collapse at the arrival point at the time equal to the real part of their eigenvalue. We show that the time-evolved TOA position probability density distribution evaluated at the time equal to the real part of the eigenvalue forms a dirac delta sequence in the limit as the imaginary part of the eigenvalue approaches zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Bell states and GHZ states serve as representative examples of high-dimensional entangled states. In this paper, we propose a scheme for generating three-dimensional Bell and GHZ entangled states using Rydberg atoms. By leveraging Rydberg-mediated interactions and introducing detuning, the system is effectively simplified into a chain-like configuration. To design effective couplings, we employ a centrosymmetric Gaussian distribution and optimize the relevant parameters. Furthermore, we take into account decoherence factors including atomic spontaneous emission, dephasing effects and random noise. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed scheme can achieve high fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decay of three-level artificial atom, a superconducting transmon qubit which interacts with a continuum of modes in an open one-dimensional waveguide. For strong interaction of transmon with a continuum we obtain analytical expressions for the frequency shifts and widths of the resonances the values of which are calculated numerically for the Gaussian density of states. We show that the coupling between the second level and ground state of a transmon significantly influences the decay of the third transmon level.</description>

      <title>Temporal filtered quantum sensing with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond are among the leading solid state quantum platforms, offering exceptional spatial resolution and sensitivity for applications such as magnetic field sensing, thermometry, and bioimaging. However, in high background environments,such as those encountered in in vitro diagnostics, the performance of NV based sensors can be compromised by strong background fluorescence, particularly from substrates such as nitrocellulose. In this work, we analytically and experimentally investigate the use of pulsed laser excitation combined with time gating techniques to suppress background fluorescence and enhance the signal to noise ratio in NV based quantum sensing, with an emphasis on spin enhanced biosensing. Through experimental studies using mixed ensembles of silicon vacancy and NV centers in bulk diamond, as well as fluorescent nanodiamonds on NC substrates, we demonstrate significant improvements in NV spin resonance visibility, demonstrated by an increase of the SNR by up to 4x, and a resulting measurement time reduction by 16x. The presented technique and results here can help significantly increase the readout efficiency and speed in future applications of NV centers in high background environments, such as in IVD, where the NV centers are used as a fluorescent label for biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Quantum-Trajectory Method for Multichannel Dicke Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and solve a Dicke superradiant model with two or more competing collective decay channels of tunable rates. Recent work analyzed stationary properties of multichannel Dicke superradiance using hydrodynamic mean-field approximations as shown by Mok et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L022015 (2025)]. We extend this with a symbolic quantum-trajectory method, providing a simple route to analytic solutions. For two channels, the behavior of the stationary ground-state distribution resembles a first-order phase transition at the point where the channel-rate ratio is equal to unity. For $d$ competing channels, we obtain scaling laws for the superradiant peak time and intensity. These results unify and extend single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters and provide a compact tool for cavity and waveguide experiments, where permutation-symmetric reservoirs engineer multiple collective decay paths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on quantum algorithms for three key matrix operations: Hadamard (Schur) product, Kronecker (tensor) product, and elementary column transformations each. By designing specific unitary transformations and auxiliary quantum measurement, efficient quantum schemes with circuit diagrams are proposed. Their computational depths are: O(1) for Kronecker product; O(max(m,n)) for Hadamard product (linked to matrix dimensions); and O(m) for elementary column transformations of (2^n X 2^m) matrices (dependent only on column count).Notably, compared to traditional column transformation via matrix transposition and row transformations, this scheme reduces computation steps and quantum gate usage, lowering quantum computing energy costs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Repeater Chains with Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Group-IV-Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a hybrid quantum repeater architecture that combines two leading hardware platforms: quantum dots (QDs) as bright, deterministic sources of entangled photon pairs and group-IV-vacancy centers in diamond as efficient, heralded quantum memories. This combination leverages high-rate entanglement generation together with long-lived storage, enabling scalable entanglement distribution over long distances. A key challenge is the large bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface, including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such hybrid systems. Finally, we analyze a full repeater chain using experimentally achievable parameters and find that a network with thousands of memories across several repeater nodes could achieve a secret-key rate of 500 bit/s over 1,000 km, demonstrating the strong potential of this approach for next-generation quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Secure PAC Learning: Sample-Budget Laws and Quantum Data-Path Admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security in machine learning is fragile when data are exfiltrated or perturbed, yet existing frameworks rarely connect the definition and analysis of the security to learnability. In this work, we develop a theory of secure learning grounded in the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) viewpoint and develop an operational framework that links data-path behavior to finite-sample budgets. In our formulation, an accuracy-confidence target is evaluated via a run-based sequential test that halts after a prescribed number of consecutive validations, and a closed-form budget bound guarantees the learning success if the data-path channel is admissible; the acceptance must also exceed a primitive random-search baseline. We elevate and complete our secure-learning construction in the context of quantum information -- establishing quantum-secure PAC learning: for prepare-and-measure scenarios, the data-path admissibility is set to be threshold fixed by Holevo information, not a learner-tunable tolerance. Thus, a certified information advantage for the learner directly becomes the learning security -- an effect with no classical analogue. The channel-determined confidence follows naturally and basis sifting is incorporated for practical deployments. This is the first complete framework that simultaneously embeds a security notion and an operational sample-budget law within the PAC learning and anchors the security in quantum information. The resulting blueprint points toward standardized guarantees for the learning security, with clear avenues for PAC-Bayes extensions and for integration with advanced quantum machine learning front ends.</description>

      <title>Photonic implementation of quantum hidden subgroup database compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate quantum data compression exploiting hidden subgroup symmetries using a photonic quantum processor. Classical databases containing generalized periodicities-symmetries that are in the worst cases inefficient for known classical algorithms to be detect-can efficiently compressed by quantum hidden subgroup algorithms. We implement a variational quantum autoencoder that autonomously learns both the symmetry type (e.g., $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vs. $\mathbb{Z}_4$) and the generalized period from structured data. The system uses single photons encoded in path, polarization, and time-bin degrees of freedom, with electronically controlled waveplates enabling tunable quantum gates. Training via gradient descent successfully identifies the hidden symmetry structure, achieving compression by eliminating redundant database entries. We demonstrate two circuit ansatzes: a parametrized generalized Fourier transform and a less-restricted architecture for Simon's symmetry. Both converge successfully, with the cost function approaching zero as training proceeds. These results provide experimental proof-of-principle that photonic quantum computers can compress classical databases by learning symmetries inaccessible to known efficient classical methods, opening pathways for quantum-enhanced information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of observables in quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum information science, yet practical implementations are fundamentally constrained by the limited number of measurement shots. In this work we explore a variation of the classical shadows protocol in which the measurements are kept local while allowing the resulting classical shadows themselves to be correlated. By constructing locally optimal shadows, we obtain unbiased estimators that outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving the same accuracy with substantially fewer measurements. We validate our approach through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians with up to 40 qubits and a 50-qubit Ising model consistently observing significant reductions in estimation errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to modify the time-convolutionless master equation (TCL-ME) to be more resistant to breakdown. We remove the standard assumption that a portion of the generator is invertible by instead taking the Moore-Penrose inverse. We rederive the perturbative expansion using Israel and Charnes' result, and test the equation up to sixth and fifth orders on the Jaynes-Cummings and Ising models, respectively. We find that in both cases, the modified equation fails to capture the dynamics of the exact solution compared to the standard TCL due to the terms of the modified equation scaling exponentially with the dimension of the bath, and connect this failure to a loss of convergence of the perturbative expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity optomagnonic platforms offer a promising route for exploring quantum phenomena, particularly quantum correlations, which are vital resources for modern quantum technologies. Here, we propose a theoretical scheme for achieving nonreciprocal quantum correlations such as entanglement, quantum discord, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) via Barnett effect in a molecular-optomagnonical system, where a yttrium iron garnet sphere is placed in a microwave cavity that is hosting molecules. We show optimal parameter regimes for achieving nonreciprocal quantum correlations through Barnett effect. The generated entanglements are robust against thermal fluctuations, persisting even at temperatures as high as $6000 K$. Our scheme suggests a new tool for engineering noise-tolerant quantum correlations, and paves a way toward realizing novel nonreciprocal quantum devices by integrating magnons with molecular ensembles.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement-based quantum links are the backbone of future quantum internet networks, enabling secure communication between distant cities. Realizing such networks requires addressing multiple practical challenges in long-distance quantum key distribution : time synchronisation, interferometer stabilisation and automation. Here, we report several advances. First, we maintained an operational QKD link continuously for 325hours over 50km between two remotes locations, demonstrating the feasibility of long-duration key generation. We further extended secure key distribution up to a 100km operational link connecting the University of Nice to a ground-based optical station, a setup compatible with future quantum satellite connections. Finally, by employing wavelength demultiplexing to separate photons of entangled pairs, we performed QKD across multiple ITU channels, achieving secure key exchange via the BBM92 protocol and time-energy observables.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as promising platforms for exploring energy storage and transfer processes governed by quantum mechanical laws. In this work, we study three models of two-qubit open quantum systems. The first model comprises two central spins immersed in spin baths, and both central spins are collectively considered as quantum batteries. The impact of inter-qubit interactions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the second model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves as a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and the bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a two-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other as a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic spin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning: A Roadmap for Reliability, Robustness, and Security in the NISQ Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling computational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent probabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and hybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent reliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This research offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning (TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliability: (i) uncertainty quantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial robustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii) privacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios. We formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information theory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty, trace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning channels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a unified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers, uncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry in attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and privacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise. This roadmap seeks to define trustworthiness as a first-class design objective for quantum AI.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bell Phase in an Electro-Nanomechanical Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspended carbon nanotubes hosting electrostatically defined quantum dots allow for exceptionally strong and tunable electromechanical coupling as well as mechanical modes that can reach the quantum ground state of motion simply by cryogenic cooling. This makes them a unique platform for quantum simulation of electron-phonon coupling. Here, we propose an experimentally realisable setup with two such carbon nanotubes in parallel, each hosting four quantum dots. Our system not only exhibits phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction, but also supports a robust, maximally entangled Bell phase at mesoscopic scales shared across the subsystems. These features highlight its potential as a simulator of strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Matter: Variational Organization through Ising Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study introduces the Adaptive Quantum Ising Agents (AQIA) framework, a Hamiltonian-based methodology that extends programmable quantum matter into an adaptive domain. Each agent operates as a finite transverse-field Ising subsystem, maintaining internal quantum coherence while interacting through state-dependent feedback channels characterised by reduced observables such as spin polarisation, bond correlation, and internal energy. These informational couplings enable the transformation of a static lattice into a feedback-reconfigurable medium. The effective Hamiltonian generated, which remains Hermitian at each iteration, is resolved self-consistently using a mean-field approximation, where the feedback fields are iteratively adjusted to minimise the total energy. Numerical investigations identify three distinct regimes: domain formation near the feedback--fluctuation critical point, glass-like frustration due to competing feedback channels, and modular polarisation sustained by structured interactions. These phenomena occur independently of geometric embedding, illustrating that informational similarity alone can induce coherent organisation. The AQIA framework is adaptable to implementation on superconducting, trapped-ion, or Rydberg platforms, offering a minimalistic model for exploring self-organisation and learning in adaptive programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient variational quantum solver for the travelling salesman problem and its silicon photonics implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The travelling salesman problem is a well-known example of computationally-hard combinatorial problem for classical machines. Here, we propose a novel variational quantum algorithm to solve it. The method is based on the preparation of two maximally entangled quantum registers whose correlations are assigned to different paths between pairs of cities. For $N$ cities, this encoding requires $2 \lceil\log_2 N\rceil$ qubits and the solution to the problem is directly found in the correlation matrix of the two registers composing the overall trial state. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we implement this algorithm for generic problems with four cities on a reconfigurable room-temperature silicon photonic circuit with integrated photon-pair sources, used to initialize maximally entangled path-encoded single-photon states.</description>

      <title>Routing single photons with quantum emitters coupled to nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures are an excellent platform for controllable single-photon scattering. The tunable light-matter interaction enables the construction of a single-photon switch -- a device that can route a single photon from an input port to a selected output port. Such single-photon switching devices can be integrated into reconfigurable photonic circuits to actively control the photon propagation direction in a quantum network. Ideally, a single-photon switch should be fast, efficient, scalable, compatible with existing technology, and should preserve the routed photon states with high fidelity. In this review, we focus on theoretical proposals and experimental demonstrations of single-photon switches based on quantum emitters coupled to solid-state nanostructures, including waveguide and cavity architectures. We also present the theoretical methods that are commonly used to model single-photon scattering in waveguide-based systems by applying them to the elementary system of a two-level emitter coupled to a waveguide. This review brings together key theoretical techniques from quantum optics, their applications to controllable single-photon transport, and the experimental realization of single-photon switching devices across different physical platforms, including semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting qubits, and color centers.</description>

      <title>Efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms for the Generalized Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer a compelling new avenue for addressing difficult NP-complete optimization problems, such as the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). Given the operational constraints of contemporary Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, hybrid quantum-classical approaches, specifically Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), promises to be effective approaches to solve real-world optimization problems. This paper proposes an approach, named VQGAP, designed to efficiently solve the GAP by optimizing quantum resources and reducing the required parametrized quantum circuit width with respect to standard VQE. The main idea driving our proposal is to decouple the qubits of ansatz circuits from the binary variables of the General Assignment Problem, by providing encoding/decoding functions transforming the solutions generated by ansatze in the limited quantum space in feasible solutions in the problem variables space, by exploiting the constraints of the problem. Preliminary results, obtained through both noiseless and noisy simulations, indicate that VQGAP exhibits performance and behavior very similar to VQE, while effectively reducing the number of qubits and circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory Can Decohere from a Causally-Indefinite Post-Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a process satisfying the axioms of hyper-decoherence which produces standard quantum theory from the theory of quantum boxes (higher-order quantum theory with the non-signalling tensor product). This hyper-decoherence map evades the no-go theorem of Lee and Selby by relaxing constraints on signalling to the past and the uniqueness of purifications. We discuss some natural opposing conclusions: that the existence of this map might be evidence of a genuine hyper-decoherence process producing causal quantum theory from its causally-indefinite higher-order theory; or that it serves as an indication that the axioms of hyper-decoherence might need careful re-consideration, especially regarding the subtle albeit central role that purity plays.</description>

      <title>Optical Vortex Transfer and Dispersion-Controlled Light Propagation in an Er YAG Three-Level Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate coherent orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) transfer and dispersion-controlled light propagation in a ladder-type Er YAG three-level system. Using the density-matrix formalism and coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations, we derive analytical expressions for the probe and generated beams that explicitly incorporate Er ion concentration. We show that an incident vortex-carrying probe beam transfers its OAM to a generated signal beam through a concentration-dependent sum-frequency nonlinear process, with complete phase and topological-charge preservation. By analyzing conversion efficiency, spatial phase, and intensity distributions, we identify an optimal Er concentration (3 percent) that maximizes vortex-transfer efficiency. Furthermore, the absorption and dispersion spectra of the probe and generated beams reveal the mechanism underpinning the vortex transfer and demonstrate tunable transitions between fast and slow regimes. These results establish Er YAG as a viable solid-state platform for the coherent manipulation of structured light, enabling efficient vortex-beam frequency conversion and dispersion engineering for applications in high-dimensional quantum communication, wavelength-compatible OAM interfaces, and slow-light photonic signal processing.</description>

      <title>On the origin of exponential operator growth in Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analysing the growth of Krylov complexity for some simple models, we find that the exponential growth of an operator in Hilbert space can be predicted from the off-diagonal decay of the operator matrix elements in the system eigenbasis. When the decay is exponential or slower, the Krylov complexity grows exponentially; when it is algebraic or slower, the growth rate is maximal. As a result, non-chaotic systems can generate exponential or even maximal operator growth, and chaotic systems can show sub-exponential growth; we give examples of both.</description>

Abstract: We recast the well-known axiom system of quantum mechanics used by physicists (the Dirac calculus) in the language of Continuous Logic. For the basic version of the axiomatic system we prove that along with the canonical continuous model the axioms have approximate finite models of large sizes, in fact the continuous model is isomorphic to an ultraproduct of finite models. We analyse the continuous logic quantifier corresponding to Dirac integration and show that in finite context it has two versions, local and global, which coincide on Gaussian wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Proton Tunneling Splittings with a Wavefunction-Based Double-Well Model: Application to the Formic Acid Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden" behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization. However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent (SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to control and enhance model behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions Across Slow and Fast Regimes in a Two-Tone Driven Duffing Resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives, governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime, where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states. We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting circuit platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode (MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.</description>

      <title>QuPCG: Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Detecting Abnormal Patterns in PCG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3 and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an 8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage. Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Solid and Supersolid from Quasiperiodic Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hard-core bosons in one dimension with quasiperiodic long-range interactions defined by V_ij = V0 cos(pi * alpha * i) cos(pi * alpha * j), where alpha = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 is the inverse golden ratio. Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal incompressible density plateaus at incommensurate fillings tied to Fibonacci ratios. These plateaus feature emergent nonuniform density profiles and robust long-range correlations, as captured by the structure factor. Depending on filling and interaction strength, the system realizes either a quasi-solid phase with suppressed superfluidity, a quasi-supersolid phase where density order coexists with finite superfluid density, or a superfluid phase. Our results demonstrate that purely interaction-induced quasiperiodicity, without external potential or disorder, can stabilize novel quantum phases that simultaneously break translational symmetry and sustain quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Federated Quantum Kernel Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap, we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed, privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Particle Quantum Walks in a Dipole-Conserving Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic memory is a theoretically predicted effect of great conceptual importance. In this Letter, we show that gravitation acceleration can serve as a source to print memory phases in superconducting states, through the electric field and vector potential it induces inside a conductor. This physical picture offers a novel perspective on the control of quantum phases and the test of gravitational effects in conductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the quantum resistance of NTRUEncrypt using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We establish formal bounds on sampling efficiency and provide security reductions to lattice problems, bridging theoretical guarantees with practical implementations. Key contributions include: a new methodology for exploring private key vulnerabilities while maintaining quantum resistance, provable mixing time bounds for high-dimensional lattices, and concrete metrics linking MCMC parameters to lattice hardness assumptions. Numerical experiments validate our approach, demonstrating improved security guarantees and computational efficiency. These findings advance the theoretical understanding and practical adoption of NTRU- Encrypt in the post-quantum era.</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of single B centers in hBN by one-to-one conversion from UV centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the variety of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers, or B centers, have gathered a particular interest owing to their excellent quantum optical properties. Moreover, the fact that they can be locally activated by an electron beam makes them suitable for top-down integration in photonic devices. However, in the absence of a real-time monitoring technique sensitive to individual emitters, the activation process is stochastic in the number of emitters, and its mechanism is under debate. Here, we implement an in-situ cathodoluminescence monitoring setup capable of detecting individual quantum emitters in the blue and ultraviolet (UV) range. We demonstrate that the activation of individual B centers is spatially and temporally correlated with the deactivation of individual UV centers emitting at 4.1 eV, which are ubiquitous in hBN. We then make use of the ability to detect individual B center activation events to demonstrate the controlled creation of an array with only one emitter per irradiation site. Additionally, we demonstrate a symmetric technique for heralded selective deactivation of individual emitters. Our results provide insights into the microscopic structure and activation mechanism of B centers, as well as versatile techniques for their deterministic integration.</description>

      <title>Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar (C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier ($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$ center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$ rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor, providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.</description>

      <title>Haldane-Inspired Generalized Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a generalized quantum statistical framework, referred to as \emph{alpha statistics}, that continuously interpolates between Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics and naturally extends into the hyperbosonic regime for $\alpha &lt; 0$. Inspired by Haldane's exclusion statistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function that encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\alpha$. Using thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the thermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase structures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes sign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and repulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the Bose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$ depends universally on $\alpha$. For negative $\alpha$, corresponding to hyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific fugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from conventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and thermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between fractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in statistical thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Post-quench relaxation dynamics of Gross-Neveu lattice fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However, time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if $\gamma&gt;0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of rotating fermionic superfluids by Sagnac phonon interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermionic many-body systems provide an unrivaled arena to investigate how interactions drive the emergence of collective quantum behavior, such as macroscopic coherence and superfluidity. Central to these phenomena is the formation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as composite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike elementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by underlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid properties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly correlated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical Sagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across the BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently exciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular fermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversed Superfluorescence in a Polaronic Quantum Material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Ever since gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) experiments have been proposed as a witness of the quantum nature of gravity, more and more theories of classical gravity coupled to quantum matter have been shown to predict GIE, despite the existence of several theory-independent no-go theorems purportedly claiming that it should not be possible. This note explains why this is possible, and why this makes the GIE experiments an even more urgent matter in quantum gravity research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Quantum States Prepared With Few Non-Clifford Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13409v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a pair of algorithms that efficiently learn a quantum state prepared by Clifford gates and $O(\log n)$ non-Clifford gates. Specifically, for an $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ prepared with at most $t$ non-Clifford gates, our algorithms use $\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$ time and copies of $|\psi\rangle$ to learn $|\psi\rangle$ to trace distance at most $\varepsilon$.
  The first algorithm for this task is more efficient, but requires entangled measurements across two copies of $|\psi\rangle$. The second algorithm uses only single-copy measurements at the cost of polynomial factors in runtime and sample complexity. Our algorithms more generally learn any state with sufficiently large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators. We also develop an efficient property testing algorithm for stabilizer dimension, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this work we explore how different types of resources are distributed among the states generated by quantum random circuits (QRC). We focus on multipartite non-locality, but we also analyze quantum correlations by appealing to different entanglement and non-classicality measures. We analyze the violation of Mermin and Svetlichny inequalities in order to get a glance at the distribution of nonlocality and genuine multipartite nonlocality. Next, we compare universal vs non-universal sets of gates, to gain insight into the problem of explaining quantum advantage. By comparing the results obtained with ideal (noiseless) vs noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we lay the basis of a certification protocol, which aims to quantify how robust is the resources distribution among the states that a given device can generate. We have implemented our non-locality-based benchmark on actual quantum processors with different architectures, in order to assess up to which point they are capable of reproducing the ideal results.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in multimode bosonic systems: II. Nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics and unidirectional coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the existence and degeneracies of quantum exceptional, diabolical, and hybrid points in simple bosonic systems - comprising up to six modes with damping and/or amplification - under two complementary scenarios to those described in arxiv:2405.01666: (i) nonconventional PT-symmetric dynamics confined to a subspace of the full Liouville space, and (ii) systems featuring unidirectional coupling.} The system dynamics described by quadratic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is governed by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Conditions for the observation of inherited quantum hybrid points with up to sixth-order exceptional and second-order diabolical degeneracies are revealed, though relevant only for short-time dynamics. This raises the question of whether higher-order inherited singularities exist in bosonic systems under general conditions. Nevertheless, for short times, unidirectional coupling of various types enables the concatenation of simple bosonic systems with second- and third-order exceptional degeneracies such that arbitrarily high exceptional degeneracies are reached. Methods for numerical identifying the quantum exceptional and hybrid points together with their degeneracies are addressed. Following arxiv:2405.01666 rich dynamics of second-order field-operator moments is analyzed from the point of view of the presence of exceptional and diabolical points and their degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Qonductor: A Cloud Orchestrator for Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe Qonductor, a cloud orchestrator for hybrid quantum-classical applications that run on heterogeneous hybrid resources. Qonductor abstracts away the complexity of hybrid programming and resource management by exposing the Qonductor API, a high-level and hardware-agnostic API. The resource estimator strategically balances quantum and classical resources to mitigate resource contention and the effects of hardware noise. The hybrid scheduler automates job scheduling on hybrid resources and balances the tradeoff between users' objectives of QoS and the cloud operator's objective of resource efficiency.
  We implement an open-source prototype and evaluate Qonductor using more than 7000 real quantum runs on the IBM quantum cloud to simulate real cloud workloads. Qonductor achieves up to 54% lower job completion times (JCTs) while sacrificing 3% execution quality, balances the load across QPU, which increases quantum resource utilization by up to 66%, and scales with growing system sizes and loads.</description>

      <title>Emergence of unidirectionality and phase separation in optically dense emitter ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transmission of light through an ensemble of two-level emitters in a one-dimensional geometry is commonly described by one of two emblematic models of quantum electrodynamics (QED): the driven-dissipative Dicke model or the Maxwell-Bloch equations. Both exhibit distinct features of phase transitions and phase separations, depending on system parameters such as optical depth and external drive strength. Here, we explore the crossover between these models via a parent spin model from bidirectional waveguide QED, by varying positional disorder among emitters. Solving mean-field equations and employing a second-order cumulant expansion for the unidirectional model -- equivalent to the Maxwell-Bloch equations -- we study phase diagrams, the emitter's inversion, and transmission depending on optical depth, drive strength, and spatial disorder. We find in the thermodynamic limit the emergence of phase separation with a critical value that depends on the degree of spatial order but is independent of Doppler broadening effects. Even far from the thermodynamic limit, this critical value marks a special point in the emitter's correlation landscape of the unidirectional model and is also observed as a maximum in the magnitude of inelastically transmitted photons. We conclude that a large class of effective one-dimensional systems without tight control of the emitter's spatial ordering can be effectively modeled using a unidirectional waveguide approach.</description>

      <title>QSCL-EWIL: Quantum Stochastic Contrast Learning for Enhanced WiFi-Based Indoor Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WiFi-based indoor localization is essential for asset tracking, healthcare monitoring, and smart buildings. However, existing systems face challenges such as data variability, environmental noise, and difficulty detecting floor and building levels, compounded by limited labeled data and high received signal strength (RSS) collection costs. This paper introduces quantum stochastic contrast learning (QSCL), a novel framework grounded in rigorous theoretical foundations. We present four theorems and one lemma that establish the probabilistic augmentation, diversity enhancement, relationship preservation, and resilience of QSCL under quantum noise, supported by formal proofs. Leveraging these foundations, QSCL utilizes quantum computing (QC) to generate strong data augmentations with stochastic perturbations, enhancing data diversity, while classical weak augmentations provide subtle variations for robust feature learning. We propose a spatial temporal adaptive attention (STAA) encoder that integrates convolutional layers with adaptive attention mechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in sequential data. Furthermore, a bidirectional contrastive loss function is introduced to capture forward and reverse relationships between augmented views, ensuring robust representations. Comprehensive evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and UTSIndoorLoc datasets validate QSCL, demonstrating superior performance with reduced labeled data and resilience to quantum noise such as bit-flip, dephasing, and measurement noise. The proposed framework significantly improves localization accuracy, floor and building detection, and generalizability in challenging indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Towards efficient quantum algorithms for diffusion probabilistic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) is a generative model renowned for its ability to produce high-quality outputs in tasks such as image and audio generation. However, training DPMs on large, high-dimensional datasets such as high-resolution images or audio incurs significant computational, energy, and hardware costs. In this work, we introduce efficient quantum algorithms for implementing DPMs through various quantum ODE solvers. These algorithms highlight the potential of quantum Carleman linearization for diverse mathematical structures, leveraging state-of-the-art quantum linear system solvers (QLSS) or linear combination of Hamiltonian simulations (LCHS). Specifically, we focus on two approaches: DPM-solver-$k$ which employs exact $k$-th order derivatives to compute a polynomial approximation of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$; and UniPC which uses finite difference of $\epsilon_\theta(x_\lambda,\lambda)$ at different points $(x_{s_m}, \lambda_{s_m})$ to approximate higher-order derivatives. As such, this work represents one of the most direct and pragmatic applications of quantum algorithms to large-scale machine learning models, presumably taking substantial steps towards demonstrating the practical utility of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Exact quantification of bipartite entanglement in unresolvable spin ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying mixed-state entanglement in many-body systems has been a formidable task. In this work, we quantify the entanglement of states in unresolvable spin ensembles, which are inherently mixed. By exploiting their permutationally invariant properties, we show that the bipartite entanglement of a wide range of unresolvable ensemble states can be calculated exactly. Our formalism is versatile; it can be used to evaluate the entanglement in an ensemble with an arbitrary number of particles, effective angular momentum, and bipartition. We apply our method to explore the characteristics of entanglement in different physically motivated scenarios, including states with definite magnetization and metrologically useful superpositions such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and spin-squeezed states. Our method can help understand the role of entanglement in spin-ensemble-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for the Floquet-Magnus expansion and their application to the semiclassical quantum Rabi model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general, nonperturbative method for deriving effective Hamiltonians of arbitrary order for periodically driven systems, based on an iterated integration by parts technique. The resulting family of effective Hamiltonians reproduces the well-known Floquet-Magnus expansion, now enhanced with explicit error bounds that quantify the distance between the exact and approximate dynamics at each order, even in cases where the Floquet-Magnus series fails to converge. We apply the method to the semiclassical Rabi model and provide explicit error bounds for both the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian and its third-order refinement. Our analysis shows that, while the rotating-wave approximation more accurately captures the true dynamics than the Bloch-Siegert Hamiltonian in most regimes, the third-order approximation ultimately outperforms both.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect Induced Anomalous Dynamics from Charge-Fluctuating Initial States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics in non-Hermitian systems has attracted significant interest, particularly due to the skin effect and its associated anomalous phenomena. Previous studies have primarily focused on initial states with a definite particle number. Here, we present a systematic study of non-reciprocal quench dynamics in the pairing states with indefinite particle number. Our study uncovers a range of novel behaviors. Firstly, we demonstrate a universal tendency towards half-filling of particle density at late times. At early times for certain initial states, we observe a chiral wavefront in both particle number distribution and charge inflow, associated with a sharp decrease in particle number. Furthermore, we find that non-Hermiticity could enhance the growth of entanglement in the initial stages of evolution. In the intermediate time regime, the characteristic skin effect leads to particle accumulation on one side, leading to a pronounced reduction in entanglement entropy. Moreover, our results reveal the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect during the restoration of U(1) symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for exploring exotic dynamic phenomena in quantum many-body systems arising from the interplay of symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum chaos via Parrondo strategies on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Rydberg Atomic Receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.</description>

Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We argue that in Rydberg states with a large principal quantum number a similar geometric angle can be generated by mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s and $1~$ms.</description>

Abstract: Loopy tensor networks have internal correlations that often make their compression inefficient. We show that even local bond optimization can make better use of the insight it has locally into relevant loop correlations. By cutting the bond, we define a set of states whose linear dependence can be used to truncate the bond dimension. The linear dependence is eliminated with zero modes of the states' metric tensor. The method is illustrated by a series of examples for the infinite pair entangled projected state (iPEPS) and for the periodic matrix product state (pMPS) that occurs in the tensor renormalization group (TRG) step. In all examples, it provides better initial truncation errors than standard initialization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis is the task of decomposing a given quantum operator into a sequence of elementary quantum gates. Since the finite target gate set cannot exactly implement any given operator, approximation is often necessary. Model counting, or #SAT, has recently been demonstrated as a promising new approach for tackling core problems in quantum circuit analysis. In this work, we show for the first time that the universal quantum circuit synthesis problem can be reduced to maximum model counting. We formulate a #SAT encoding for exact and approximate depth-optimal quantum circuit synthesis into the Clifford+T gate set. We evaluate our method with an open-source implementation that uses the maximum model counter d4Max as a backend. For this purpose, we extended d4Max with support for complex and negative weights to represent amplitudes. Experimental results show that existing classical tools have potential for the quantum circuit synthesis problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Implementation of Dynamical Mean Field Theory for Correlated Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics and computational chemistry. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some of the correlated behavior using an impurity model, but it is limited by the need to calculate the impurity Green's function. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins state preparation with time evolution to compute Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits, 1 ancilla). We discuss potential paths toward realizing this quantum computing use case in materials science.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical, data-informed, Venus YFP dimer time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB in Venus YFP dimers are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several Lindblad approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of quantum sensing in a dissipatively coupled two-mode system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensing near exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems has shown promising sensitivity enhancements. However, practical applications are often hindered by structural complexity and strict parameter constraints. In this work, we introduce a simplified anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric platform consisting of two independently cavities, which are indirectly coupled to each other by a shared dissipative environment. We demonstrate a significantly enhanced sensing response at the EPs compared to non-EP configurations. This improvement is attributed to the dominant second-order term in the Laurent series expansion of the eigenvalue response to external perturbations- a characteristic feature of higher-order singularities at EPs. This mechanism not only reinforces the foundation for sensitivity enhancement but also offers a structurally compact and robust strategy for quantum sensing. Our results underscore the potential of anti-PT symmetric systems in enabling high-precision sensing technologies and bridging non-Hermitian physics with scalable photonic device platforms.</description>

Abstract: We construct the most general form of our previously proposed nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics that possesses three basic properties. Unlike the simpler model, the new version is not completely integrable, but it has an underlying Hamiltonian structure. We analyze a particular solution in detail, and we use a natural extension of the Born rule to compute particle trajectories. We find that closed particle orbits are possible.</description>

      <title>Comparative Studies of Quantum Annealing, Digital Annealing, and Classical Solvers for Reaction Network Pathway Analysis and mRNA Codon Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For various optimization problems, the classical time to solution is super-polynomial and intractable to solve with classical bit-based computing hardware to date. Digital and quantum annealers have the potential to identify near-optimal solutions for such optimization problems using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem formulation. This work benchmarks two use cases to evaluate the utility of QUBO solvers for combinatorial optimization problems, in order to determine if a QUBO formulation and annealing-based algorithms have an advantage over classical mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) solvers. Various QUBO and solver metrics such as problem mapping, quantitative interconnectivity, penalty structure, solver minimum cost (obtained optimal value) and solver time to solution have been applied to evaluate different QUBO problems. Constrained and unconstrained QUBO solvers are compared including the Fujitsu digital annealer (DA), various D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing solvers (QA, HQA), and the classical MIP/CP solvers HiGHS, Gurobi, SCIP, and CP-SAT. The two industrially relevant use cases are reaction network pathway analysis and mRNA codon selection. For reaction pathway analysis, classical MIP/CP solvers (especially Gurobi and CP-SAT) are observed to solve the problem to optimality in reasonable time frames. For mRNA codon selection, Gurobi outperformed all other solvers in time to solution for all problem sizes, followed by CP-SAT and the D-Wave Nonlinear (NL) HQA solver.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Framework for Quantum Optimisation and Quantum Neural Networks: Credit Feature Selection and Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the efficacy of quantum computing in two distinct machine learning tasks: feature selection for credit risk assessment and image classification for handwritten digit recognition. For the first task, we address the feature selection challenge of the German Credit Dataset by formulating it as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which is solved using quantum annealing to identify the optimal feature subset. Experimental results show that the resulting credit scoring model maintains high classification precision despite using a minimal number of features. For the second task, we focus on classifying handwritten digits 3 and 6 in the MNIST dataset using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Through meticulous data preprocessing (downsampling, binarization), quantum encoding (FRQI and compressed FRQI), and the design of QNN architectures (CRADL and CRAML), we demonstrate that QNNs can effectively handle high-dimensional image data. Our findings highlight the potential of quantum computing in solving practical machine learning problems while emphasizing the need to balance resource expenditure and model efficacy.</description>

      <title>Propagation of intense squeezed vacuum light in non-linear media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in quantum light engineering have enabled the use of infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) femtosecond pulses in highly nonlinear optics, particularly strong field physics and high-harmonic generation. However, theoretical studies were focused on the microscopic interaction with a single atom, neglecting the crucial macroscopic aspect of light propagation through the media. This raises a key question: How does BSV propagates in strongly light-driven nonlinear media and how this affects the generation of non-linear optical signals? We address this question by introducing a fully quantized framework that accounts for the propagation in gas media. We find that atomic ionization caused by strong BSV fluctuations and the associated infrared photon losses introduce decoherence effects that can substantially limit the propagation length in the medium, reduce the harmonic yield, and decrease the number of emitted harmonics at high intensities. However, these effects are not detrimental. We identify conditions under which propagation-induced decoherence is minimized while the generated harmonics remain clearly detectable--an issue of particular importance for future studies exploring the connection between strong-field physics and quantum optics. Our results lay the foundation for future studies of BSV in strong-field physics, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast science, and establish a basis for exploring its propagation through all states of matter in a fully quantized framework.</description>

      <title>Excited-CAFQA: A classical simulation bootstrap for the variational estimation of molecular excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However, the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in quantum physics is to quantify the entanglement of $d$-partite states and their separability. We show here that these problems are best addressed using tensors. The geometric measure of entanglement of a pure state is one of most natural ways to quantify the entanglement, which is simply related to the spectral norm of a tensor state. On the other hand, the logarithm of the nuclear norm of the state and density tensors can be considered as its ``energy''. We first show that the most geometric measure entangled $d$-partite state has the minimum spectral norm and maximum nuclear norm. Second, we introduce the notion of Hermitian and density tensors, and the subspace of bi-symmetric Hermitian tensors, which correspond to Bosons. We show that separable density tensors, and strongly separable bi-symmetric density tensors are characterized by the value (equal to one) of their corresponding nuclear norms. In general, these characterizations are NP-hard to verify. Third, we show that the above quantities are computed in polynomial time when we restrict our attentions to Bosons: symmetric $d$-qubits, or more generally to symmetric $d$-qunits in $C^n$, and the corresponding bi-symmetric Hermtian density tensors, for a fixed value of $n$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a variational quantum computing approach for reconstructing quantum states from measurement data. By mapping the reconstruction cost function onto an Ising model, the problem can be solved using a variational eigensolver on present-day quantum hardware. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the method on quantum structured light, in particular, entangled photons carrying orbital angular momentum and show that the reconstruction procedure can yield reliable performance even on noisy devices. Our results highlight the potential of variational algorithms for efficient quantum state tomography, particularly for high-dimensional structured light, where classical approaches can face bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Error Correction with Permutation-Invariant Approximate Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular quantum computing architectures require error correction schemes that remain effective in the presense of noisy inter-processor operations. We introduce a distributed quantum error correction framework based on approximate codes to address this challenge. Our approach enables concatenation of distinct local codes across modules while allowing logical operations composed primarily of processor-local gates. We derive a lower bound and present corresponding simulations which indicate that this nontraditional approach can provide marked advantage over existing approaches in the highly non-uniform error landscape of a distributed quantum computer. As a concrete realization, we present encoding and decoding circuits for the permutation-invariant W- state code and propose efficient methods for its preparation. These results highlight the potential of approximate distributed error correction strategies for scalable, modular, fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unambiguous measurements play an important role in quantum information, with applications ranging from quantum key distribution to quantum state reconstruction. Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum algorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is the S-$|LWE&gt;$ problem in the lattice setting and the Quantum Decoding Problem in the code setting. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous measurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from a quantum state $|\psi_x\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with errors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to analyze this approach has been lacking.
  In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous measurements. Given a family of states $\{\,|\psi_x\rangle\,\}_{x\in\{0,1\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist measurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about $x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally arises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal number of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear program, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results showing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach of arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the Quantum Decoding Problem.</description>

Abstract: The natural gradient is central in neural quantum states optimizations but it is limited by the cost of computing and inverting the quantum geometric tensor, the quantum analogue of the Fisher information matrix. We introduce a block-diagonal quantum geometric tensor that partitions the metric by network layers, analogous to block-structured Fisher methods such as K-FAC. This layer-wise approximation preserves essential curvature while removing noisy cross-layer correlations, improving conditioning and scalability. Experiments on Heisenberg and frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ models show faster convergence, lower energy, and improved stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification of cancer driver genes is fundamental for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. The integration of mutational profiles with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks offers a promising avenue for their detection [ 1, 2], but scaling to large network datasets is computationally demanding. Quantum computing offers compact representations and potential complexity reductions. Motivated by the classical method of Gumpinger et al. [3], in this work we introduce a supervised quantum framework that combines mutation scores with network topology via a novel state preparation scheme, Quantum Multi-order Moment Embedding (QMME). QMME encodes low-order statistical moments over the mutation scores of a node's immediate and second-order neighbors, and encodes this information into quantum states. These are used as inputs to a kernel-based quantum binary classifier that discriminates known driver genes from others. Simulations on an empirical PPI network demonstrate competitive performance, with a 12.6% recall gain over a classical baseline. The pipeline performs explicit quantum state preparation and requires no classical training, enabling an efficient, nearly end-to-end quantum workflow. A brief complexity analysis suggests the approach could achieve a quantum speedup in network-based cancer gene prediction. This work underscores the potential of supervised quantum graph learning frameworks to advance biological discovery.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet substantial gaps separate today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices from tomorrow's fault-tolerant application-scale quantum (FASQ) machines. We identify four related hurdles along the road ahead: (i) from error mitigation to active error detection and correction, (ii) from rudimentary error correction to scalable fault tolerance, (iii) from early heuristics to mature, verifiable algorithms, and (iv) from exploratory simulators to credible advantage in quantum simulation. Targeting these transitions will accelerate progress toward broadly useful quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spin-flip probabilities emerge in the relativistic regime for scalar potentials, absent in the standard Dirac representation. We examine 1D scattering for the Dirac equation employing an alternate matrix representation introduced by the Author in an earlier study. We demonstrate that the transmission (T) and reflection (R) coefficients can depend on the chosen representation of the Clifford algebra despite the two representations being related by a unitary or non-unitary transformation. We also show that for the non-unitary case quantum interference may arise in scattering phenomena, a testable experimental signature. This representation dependence hints at hidden physics in how spinor components couple to external steps/barriers, even when the relativistic dispersion relation (E^2=p^2+m^2) is the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the widely used Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of stochastic pure-state trajectories and the corresponding continuous measurement protocols, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>

      <title>Free-space multi-user quantum network with high key rate</title>

Abstract: Emergent quantum networks are the essential ingredient for securely connecting multiple users worldwide, extensively deployed in both fibre and free-space. An essential element is the multiplexing of entanglement to multiple users, overcoming the peer-to-peer restriction of quantum key distribution (QKD), so far successfully shown in fibre-based architectures. Here, we demonstrate a free-space quantum space division multiplexing architecture using just one entanglement source to realise a fully connected twelve-channel quantum network for seamless QKD connections between six users. The network achieves record coincidence rates exceeding $3 \times 10^{4}$ s$^{-1}$ between any pair of nodes on the network, for sifted key rate of over 400 kbps. Our approach overcomes the active switching hurdle that has hindered the free-space deployment of quantum multiplexing, is fully passive, easily scalable to more nodes and compatible with fibre-based integration, thus opening a new path to scalable and resource-efficient quantum networks that utilise free-space links.</description>

      <title>Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we capture the hitherto unobserved phenomenon of trans-Planckian damping. We show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is subsequently broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

      <title>MediQ-GAN: Quantum-Inspired GAN for High Resolution Medical Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis shows promise, yet medical imaging datasets are often scarce, imbalanced, and constrained by privacy, making data augmentation essential. Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Emergent Distance and Metricity of Mutual Information in 1D Quantum Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and formalize a phase diagnostic based on the information-distance \(d_E = K_0/\sqrt{I}\) (mutual information \(I\)) for 1D quantum chains. Calibrating with the Euclidean benchmark \(I(r)\propto r^{-2}\mapsto d_E(r)\propto r\) makes the triangle-inequality test parameter-free and scale-invariant. Under site-averaged, monotone scaling conditions on the 1D line we establish a criterion linking the decay of \(I(r)\) to metric behavior of \(d_E(r)\): power laws \(I(r)\sim r^{-X}\) with \(0&lt;X\le 2\) yield subadditivity (metric scaling), while exponential clustering leads to superadditivity. As an analytic check complementing our earlier numerical study, we verify these predictions in the 1D transverse-field Ising chain using an exact Jordan-Wigner/Bogoliubov-de Gennes solution: at criticality \(I(r)\) follows a power law close to the \(X=2\) benchmark and the equal-legs triangle defect \(\Delta(r,r)=d_E(2r)-2d_E(r)\) is asymptotically non-positive; in gapped regimes \(I(r)\) decays exponentially and \(\Delta(r,r)\gg 0\). The result is a practical, falsifiable large-scale diagnostic based solely on site-averaged two-site mutual information.</description>

      <title>A charge-density machine-learning workflow for computing the infrared spectrum of molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning workflow for the calculation of the infrared spectrum of molecules, and more generally of other temperature-dependent electronic observables. The main idea is to use the Jacobi-Legendre cluster expansion to predict the real-space charge density of a converged density-functional-theory calculation. This gives us access to both energy and forces, and to electronic observables such as the dipole moment or the electronic gap. Thus, the same model can simultaneously drive a molecular dynamics simulation and evaluate electronic quantities along the trajectory, namely it has access to the same information of ab-initio molecular dynamics. A similar approach within the framework of machine-learning force fields would require the training of multiple models, one for the molecular dynamics and others for predicting the electronic quantities. The scheme is implemented here within the numerical framework of the PySCF code and applied to the infrared spectrum of the uracil molecule in the gas phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</description>

      <title>Artificial discovery of lattice models for wave transport</title>

Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as Faradaic reactions at electrochemical interfaces, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN) architecture in which the recurrent core is realized as a parametrized quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC in an exponentially large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$, which serves as a coherent recurrent quantum memory. The PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit Pauli expectation-value readouts are combined with the input embedding and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial observation via mid-circuit readouts, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling. For sequence-to-sequence learning, we further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts and show its effectiveness for machine translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise) grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Area Operators in the Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In some cases in two and three bulk dimensions without bulk local degrees of freedom, I look for area operators in a fixed boundary theory. In each case, I define an exact quantum error-correcting code (QECC) and show that it admits a central decomposition. However, the area operator that arises from this central decomposition vanishes. A non-zero area operator, however, emerges after coarse-graining. The expectation value of this operator approximates the actual entanglement entropy for a class of states that do not form a linear subspace. These non-linear constraints can be interpreted as semiclassicality conditions. The coarse-grained area operator is ambiguous, and this ambiguity can be matched with that in defining fixed-area states.</description>
