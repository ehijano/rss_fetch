      <title>A notion of quasi-convex subgroups in acylindrically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a notion of quasiconvexity in the setting of finitely-generated groups with hyperbolically embedded subgroups. Our main result shows that this notion yields uniform quasiconvex constants in the setting of coned-off cusped spaces. We also prove that this notion of quasiconvexity is preserved under sufficiently long Dehn filling. As an application, we generalize a theorem of Groves-Manning on groups acting on $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes.</description>

      <title>Rigid automorphisms of linking systems of finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a centric linking system associated to a saturated fusion system on a finite $p$-group $S$. An automorphism of $\mathcal{L}$ is said to be rigid if it restricts to the identity on the fusion system. An inner rigid automorphism is conjugation by some element of the center of $S$. If $\mathcal{L}$ is the centric linking system of a finite group $G$, then rigid automorphisms of $\mathcal{L}$ are closely related to automorphisms of $G$ that centralize $S$. For odd primes, all rigid automorphisms are known to be inner, but this fails for the prime 2. We determine which known quasisimple linking systems at the prime 2 have a noninner rigid automorphism. Based on previous results, this reduces to handling the case of the linking systems at the prime 2 of finite simple groups of Lie type in odd characteristic. These have no noninner rigid automorphisms with two families of exceptions: the 2-dimensional projective special linear groups and even-dimensional orthogonal groups for quadratic forms of nonsquare discriminant.</description>

      <title>Complex Lies, Real Physics: The Role of Algebra Complexification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics, Lie groups represent the algebraic structure that describes symmetry transformations of a given system. Then, the descending Lie algebra of those groups are necessary real. In most cases, the complexification of those Lie algebra is necessary in order to derive irreductible representations of the Lie algebra and subsequently of the symmetry group. In this paper, we give a precise definition of the concept and prove step by step an important result $$\left(\mathfrak{g}^\mathbb{R}\right)_\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathfrak{g} \times \bar{\mathfrak{g}}. $$ This result is used to determine the irreductible representations of the proper Lorentz group and thus the physical objects admissible when this symmetry is present. It is shown that finite representations of the proper Lorentz group are characterized by pairs of half-integers $(j_1,j_2)$, which determine unambiguously the physical object associated to the given representation. For example, the representation $(0,0)$ of dimension $1$ is called the scalar representation, it corresponds to the Higgs field, and $(\frac{1}{2},0) \oplus (0,\frac{1}{2})$ of dimension $4$ is called the Dirac spinor representation, it corresponds to matter particle called fermions. This means that the mathematical group structure determines the material content of the universe following this algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of the Projective Linear Group Realized by wild Galois Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. This paper investigates linear representations of Galois groups arising from wild Galois points on projective hypersurfaces. We prove that these Galois groups lift to the general linear group and act naturally on vector spaces. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subgroups of the projective linear group to be realized as Galois groups of wild Galois points. In addition, we show that projections from wild Galois points on normal hypersurfaces are necessarily wildly ramified. We provide a geometric criterion for detecting wild ramification via the fixed loci of birational automorphisms, linking group-theoretic properties to the geometry of the hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Cuts, flows and gradient conditions on harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced cohomology motivates to look at harmonic functions which satisfy certain gradient conditions. If $G$ is a direct product of two infinite groups or a (FC-central)-by-cyclic group, then there are no harmonic functions with gradient in $c_0$ on its Cayley graphs. From this, it follows that a metabelian group $G$ has no harmonic functions with gradient in $\ell^p$.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Symmetric Spaces: arbitrary symmetrizable complex or almost split real type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02176v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kac-Moody symmetric spaces have been introduced by Freyn, Hartnick, Horn and the first-named author for centered Kac-Moody groups, that is, Kac-Moody groups that are generated by their root subgroups. In the case of non-invertible generalized Cartan matrices this leads to complications that -- within the approach proposed originally -- cannot be repaired in the affine case. In the present article we propose an alternative approach to Kac-Moody symmetric spaces which for invertible generalized Cartan matrices provides exactly the same concept, which for the non-affine non-invertible case provides alternative Kac-Moody symmetric spaces, and which finally provides Kac-Moody symmetric spaces for affine Kac-Moody groups. In a nutshell, the original intention by Freyn, Hartnick, Horn and K\"ohl was to construct symmetric spaces that likely lead to primitive actions of the Kac-Moody groups; this, of course, cannot work in the affine case as affine Kac-Moody groups are far from simple. Additionally, we study the Galois descent to almost split real Kac-Moody symmetric spaces based on the theory of almost split Kac-Moody groups developed by R\'emy 2002.</description>

      <title>Weighted Orlicz $*$-algebras on locally elliptic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally elliptic group, $(\Phi,\Psi)$ a complementary pair of Young functions, and $\omega: G \rightarrow [1,\infty)$ a weight function on $G$ such that the weighted Orlicz space $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is a Banach $*$-algebra when equipped with the convolution product and involution $f^*(x):=\overline{f(x^{-1})}$ ($f \in L^\Phi(G,\omega)$). Such a weight always exists on $G$ and we call it an $L^\Phi$-weight. We assume that $1/\omega \in L^\Psi(G)$ so that $L^\Phi(G,\omega) \subseteq L^1(G)$. This paper studies the spectral theory and primitive ideal structure of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$. In particular, we focus on studying the Hermitian, Wiener and $*$-regularity properties on this algebra, along with some related questions on spectral synthesis. It is shown that $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is always quasi-Hermitian, weakly-Wiener and $*$-regular. Thus, if $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is Hermitian, then it is also Wiener. Although, in general, $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is not always Hermitian, it is known that Hermitianness of $L^1(G)$ implies Hermitianness of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ if $\omega$ is sub-additive. We give numerous examples of locally elliptic groups $G$ for which $L^1(G)$ is Hermitian and sub-additive $L^\Phi$-weights on these groups. In the weighted $L^1$ case, even stronger Hermitianness results are formulated.</description>
