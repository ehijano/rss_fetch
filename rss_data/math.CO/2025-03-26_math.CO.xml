      <title>On edge-direction and compact edge-end spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directions of graphs were originally introduced in the study of a cops-and-robbers kind of game, while the study of end spaces has been used to generalize classical graph-theoretical results to infinite graphs, such as Halin's generalization of Menger's theorem. An edge-analogue of end spaces, where finite sets of edges are used instead of vertices as separator agents to form the so-called edge-end space, has been recently used to obtain an edge-analogue of this later result. Inspired by Diestel's correspondence between directions and ends of a graph, we tackle in this paper an edge-analogue of directions, its relation with line graphs, and an edge-analogue of Diestel's correspondence. The results of this study had some implications over edge-end space compactness, which then became a target of inquiry: we thus show an edge-analogue of Diestel's combinatorial characterization for compact end spaces. Non-edge-dominating vertices play an important role in our characterization, which motivated the study of ends and directions using now finite sets of these vertices as separator agents, as done previously for edges, giving rise to other topological spaces associated with graphs. These new direction and end spaces once again motivate an analogue of Diestel's correspondence result, and further generalizations are obtained. All of these constructions define topological space-classes associated with graphs such as edge-end spaces and edge-direction spaces of graphs. The paper organizes these topological space-classes appearing throughout the text with representation results, as it was done by Pitz and Kurkofka, as well as Aurichi, Real and Magalh\~aes J\'unior. Most notably, we show that every compact edge-end space can be represented as the edge-direction space of a connected graph.</description>

      <title>The complexity of matroid homomorphism reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a reconfiguration version of the homomorphism problem ${\rm Hom}_\mathbb{M}(N)$ for binary matroids $N$. This reconfiguration problem, ${\rm Recol}_\mathbb{M}(N)$, asks, for two homomorphisms $\phi$ and $\psi$ of a matroid $M$ to $N$, if there is a path of homomorphism from $\phi$ to $\psi$ such that consecutive homomorphism in the path differ on a single cocircuit of $N$. We show that this problem is trivial in the case that $N$ dismantles to the graphic matroid $M(K_2)$, and that the problem is ${\rm PSPACE}$-complete when $N$ is the graphic matroid $M(K_3)$, $M(K_4)$, or any graphic matroid containing $M(K_5)$.</description>

      <title>Solutions of inhomogeneous linear difference equations using Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formula for the particular solution of an inhomogeneous linear difference equation with variable coefficients. The answer is expressed as a weighted sum of fundamental solutions of the associated linear difference equation. This corresponds to an initial value problem in the case of linear differential equations. We remark that Green's functions are naturally suited for solving such problems. This note presents a Green's function formalism to solve an inhomogeneous linear difference equation with variable coefficients. Both the retarded and advanced Green's functions are required, to obtain a complete solution. We independently confirm previous work for the case of linear difference equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Maximum number of edge colorings avoiding rainbow copies of $K_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that for $r\geq 12$ and any sufficiently large $n$-vertex graph $G$ the number of $r$-edge-colorings of $G$ with no rainbow $K_4$ is at most $r^{ex(n,K_4)}$, where $ex(n,K_4)$ denotes the Tur\'{a}n number of $K_4$. Moreover, $G$ attains equality if and only if it is the Tur\'{a}n graph $T_3(n)$.
  The bound on the number of colors $r\geq 12$ is best possible. It improves upon a result of H. Lefmann, D.A. Nolibos, and the second author who showed the same result for $r \geq 5434$ and it confirms a conjecture by Gupta, Pehova, Powierski and Staden.</description>

      <title>Block diagonally symmetric lozenge tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new symmetry class of both boxed plane partitions and lozenge tilings of a hexagon, called the $\mathbf{r}$-block diagonal symmetry class, where $\mathbf{r}$ is an $n$-tuple of non-negative integers. We prove that the tiling generating function of this symmetry class under a certain weight assignment is given by a simple product formula. As a consequence, the volume generating function of $\mathbf{r}$-block symmetric plane partitions is obtained. Additionally, we consider $(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r^{\prime}})$-block diagonally symmetric lozenge tilings by embedding the hexagon into a cylinder and present an identity for the signed enumeration of this symmetry class in specific cases. Two methods are provided to study this symmetry class: (1) the method of non-intersecting lattice paths with a modification, and (2) interpreting weighted lozenge tilings algebraically as (skew) Schur polynomials and applying the dual Pieri rule.</description>

      <title>Boundary measurements of positive networks on a cylinder of maximal rank 2 and 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundary measurement matrices associated to networks on a plane correspond to certain totally nonnegative Grassmannians as shown previously by A. Postnikov. In this paper, we look to generalize this result by categorizing the boundary measurements associated to networks on a cylinder of maximal rank 2 and 3. In particular, we show that the maximal rank 3 matrices associated to networks on a cylinder are precisely the matrices in which every odd-dimensional minor is nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Invariant theory for wreath products acting on superpolynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a finite group $G$ acting linearly on the variables $V$ of a polynomial algebra, or an exterior algebra, or superpolynomial algebra with both commuting and anticommuting variables. In this setting, the Hilbert series for the $G$-invariant subalgebra turns out to determine the analogous Hilbert series for the wreath product $P[G]$ acting on $V^n$ for any permutation group $P$ inside the symmetric group $S_n$ on $n$ letters.
  This leads to a structural result: one can collate the direct sum for all $n$ of the $S_n[G]$-invariant subalgebras to form a graded ring via an external shuffle product, whose structure turns out to be a superpolynomial algebra generated by the $G$-invariants. A parallel statement holds for the direct sum of all $S_n[G]$-antiinvariants, which forms a graded ring via an external signed shuffle product, isomorphic to the superexterior algebra generated by the $G$-invariants.</description>

      <title>The chromatic symmetric function of graphs glued at a single vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how the chromatic symmetric function of two graphs glued at a single vertex can be expressed as a matrix multiplication using certain information of the two individual graphs. We then prove new $e$-positivity results by using a connection between forest triples, defined by the first author, and Hikita's probabilities associated to standard Young tableaux. Specifically, we prove that gluing a sequence of unit interval graphs and cycles results in an $e$-positive graph. We also prove $e$-positivity for a graph obtained by gluing the first and last vertices of such a sequence. This generalizes $e$-positivity of cycle-chord graphs and supports Ellzey's conjectured $e$-positivity for proper circular arc digraphs.</description>

      <title>Three algorithmic approaches to the general position problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G$ is a graph, then $X\subseteq V(G)$ is a general position set if for every two vertices $v,u\in X$ and every shortest $(u,v)$-path $P$, it holds that no inner vertex of $P$ lies in $X$. In this note we propose three algorithms to compute a largest general position set in $G$: an integer linear programming algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and a simulated annealing algorithm. These approaches are supported by examples from different areas of graph theory.</description>

      <title>Obstructions for homomorphisms to odd cycles in series-parallel graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $H$, an $H$-colouring of a graph $G$ is a vertex map $\phi:V(G) \to V(H)$ such that adjacent vertices are mapped to adjacent vertices. A graph $G$ is $C_{2k+1}$-critical if $G$ has no $C_{2k+1}$-colouring but every proper subgraph of $G$ has a $C_{2k+1}$-colouring. We prove a structural characterisation of $C_{2k+1}$-critical graphs when $k \geq 2$. In the case that $k = 2$, we use the aforementioned charazterisation to show a $C_3$-free series-parallel graph $G$ has a $C_5$-colouring if either $G$ has neither $C_8$ nor $C_{10}$, or $G$ has no two $5$-cycles sharing a vertex.</description>

      <title>The maximum spectral radius of $\theta_{2,2,3}$-free graphs with given size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theta graph $\theta_{r,p,q}$ is the graph obtained by connecting two distinct vertices with three internally disjoint paths of length $r,p,q$, where $q\geq p\geq r\geq1$ and $p\geq2$. A graph is $\theta_{r,p,q}$-free if it does not contain $\theta_{r,p,q}$ as a subgraph. The maximum spectral radius of $\theta_{1,p,q}$-free graphs with given size has been determined for any $q\geq p\geq2$. Zhai, Lin and Shu [Spectral extrema of graphs with fixed size: cycles and complete bipartite graphs, European J. Combin. 95 (2021) 103322] characterized the extremal graph with the maximum spectral radius of $\theta_{2,2,2}$-free graphs having $m$ edges. In this paper, we consider the maximum spectral radius of $\theta_{2,2,3}$-free graphs with size $m$ and characterize the extremal graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a problem posed by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal in 1991, proving that for all $n \geq 600$, every $(2n+1)$-vertex graph with at least $n^2 + n + 1$ edges contains two vertices of equal degree connected by a path of length three. The complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n+1}$ demonstrates that this edge bound is sharp. We further establish an analogous result for graphs with even order and investigate several related extremal problems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-random hypergraphs arising from multivariate polynomials and their applications to Diophantine sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide new explicit constructions of families of quasi-random hypergraphs using algebraic properties of multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our construction not only offers a systematic method for constructing quasi-random hypergraphs but also provides a unified framework for studying various hypergraphs arising from multivariate polynomials over finite fields, including Paley sum hypergraphs, and hypergraphs derived from Diophantine tuples and their generalizations. In particular, we refine an estimate related to even partial octahedrons in Paley sum hypergraphs, improving upon a result by Chung and Graham. Inspired by our quasi-random constructions, we establish an asymptotic formula for the number of $k$-Diophantine $m$-tuples over finite fields, addressing a question of Hammonds et al.; we also study some related questions for $f$-Diophantine sets, extending and improving several recent works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the relation among the number of spanning trees of intermediate graphs in a Galois cover, building on results for $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^m$-covers previously established by Hammer, Mattman, Sands, and Valli\`{e}res. We generalize their results to arbitrary finite Galois covers. Using the Ihara zeta function and the Artin--Ihara $L$-function, we prove two formulas which are graph-theoretic analogues of Kuroda's formula and the Brauer--Kuroda relations in algebraic number theory. Furthermore, we prove that a spanning tree formula does not exist if the Galois group is cyclic.</description>

      <title>Zigzags, contingency tables, and quotient rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{x}_{k \times p}$ be a $k \times p$ matrix of variables and let $\mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{k \times p}]$ be the polynomial ring in these variables. Given two weak compositions $\alpha,\beta \models_0 n$ of lengths $\ell(\alpha) = k$ and $\ell(\beta) = p$, we study the ideal $I_{\alpha,\beta} \subseteq \mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{k \times \ell}]$ generated by row sums, column sums, monomials in row $i$ of degree $&gt; \alpha_i$, and monomials in column $j$ of degree $&gt; \beta_j$. We prove results connecting algebraic properties of the quotient ring $R_{\alpha,\beta} := \mathbb{F}[\mathbf{x}_{k \times \ell}]/I_{\alpha,\beta}$ with the set $C_{\alpha,\beta}$ of $\alpha,\beta$-contingency tables. The standard monomial basis of $R_{\alpha,\beta}$ with respect to a diagonal term order is encoded by the matrix-ball avatar of the RSK correspondence. We describe the Hilbert series of $R_{\alpha,\beta}$ in terms of a zigzag statistic on contingency tables. The ring $R_{\alpha,\beta}$ carries a graded action of the product $\mathrm{Stab}(\alpha) \times \mathrm{Stab}(\beta)$ of symmetry groups of the sequences $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k)$ and $\beta = (\beta_1,\dots,\beta_p)$; we describe how to calculate the isomorphism type of this graded action. Our analysis regards the set $C_{\alpha,\beta}$ as a locus in the affine space $\mathrm{Mat}_{k \times p}(\mathbb{F})$ and applies orbit harmonics to this locus.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci-like partitions and their associated piecewise-defined permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a family of partitions of the set of natural numbers, Fibonacci-like partitions. In particular, we introduce a Fibonacci-like partition in a number of parts corresponding to the Fibonacci numbers, the standard Fibonacci-like partitions of the first kind. That partition refines the well-known partition in two parts associated to the Wythoff sequences. In a similar way, we introduce another family of Fibonacci-like partitions of the natural numbers, with an initial segment removed, in a number of parts which also follows the Fibonacci sequence, the standard Fibonacci-like partitions of the second kind.
  We study some piecewise-defined permutations over Fibonacci-like partitions, which give both torsion-free and torsion elements in the symmetric group over the set of natural numbers. We give an application of Fibonacci-like partitions to the study of a sequence analyzed by A. Shapovalov and by B.J. Venkatachala. We give also a generalization of the mentioned sequence, involving techniques that are not related to Fibbonaci numbers nor Beatty sequences, obtaining an infinite family of sequences that we conjecture that produce an infinite orthogonal array in which the number of symbols, trials and factors is countable infinite, and having an automorphism group isomorphic to Z acting regularly on the symbol set.</description>

      <title>Many antipodes implies many neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $\left\{x_1, \dots, x_n\right\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a set of $n$ points in the plane with diameter $\leq 1$, meaning $\|x_i - x_j\| \leq 1$ for all $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. We show that if there are many `antipodes', these are pairs of points of with distance $\geq 1-\varepsilon$, then there are many neighbors, these are pairs of points that are distance $\leq \varepsilon$. More precisely, we prove that for some universal $c&gt;0$, $$ \# \left\{(i,j): \|x_i - x_j\| \leq \varepsilon\right\} \geq \frac{c \cdot \varepsilon^{3/4}}{\left( \log \varepsilon^{-1} \right)^{1/4}}\cdot \# \left\{(i,j): \|x_i - x_j\| \geq 1- \varepsilon\right\}.$$ The inequality is very easy too prove with factor $\varepsilon^2$ and easy with $\varepsilon$. The optimal rate might be $\varepsilon^{1/2}$ which is attained by several examples.</description>

      <title>Vector encoding of phylogenetic trees by ordered leaf attachment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10169v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of work to connect phylogenetics with machine learning, there has been considerable recent interest in vector encodings of phylogenetic trees. We present a simple new "ordered leaf attachment" (OLA) method for uniquely encoding a binary, rooted phylogenetic tree topology as an integer vector. OLA encoding and decoding take linear time in the number of leaf nodes, and the set of vectors corresponding to trees is a simply-described subset of integer sequences. The OLA encoding is unique compared to other existing encodings in having these properties. The integer vector encoding induces a distance on the set of trees, and we investigate this distance in relation to the NNI and SPR distances.</description>

      <title>Cluster Synchronization via Graph Laplacian Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost equitable partitions (AEPs) have been linked to cluster synchronization in oscillatory systems, providing a mathematical framework for understanding collective behavior. Using the spectral properties of AEPs, we can describe this synchronization behavior in terms of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors. Our results also shed light on transient hierarchical clustering as well as multi frequency clustering, and the conditions under which they can occur. Through our analysis we are able to relate dynamical clustering phenomena directly to network symmetry and community detection, joining the structural and functional notions of clustering in complex networks. This bridges a crucial gap between static network topology and emergent dynamic behavior. Additionally, this description of the problem allows us to define a relaxation of an AEP we call a quasi-equitable partition (QEP). Perfect AEPs are rare in real-world networks since most have some degree of irregularity or noise. While relaxing these strict conditions, QEPs are able to maintain many of the useful properties allowing for qualitatively similar clustering behavior as with AEPs. Our findings have important implications for understanding synchronization patterns in real-world networks, from neural circuits to power grids.</description>

      <title>The generalized Alice HH vs Bob HT problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2024, Daniel Litt posed a simple coinflip game pitting Alice's "Heads-Heads" vs Bob's "Heads-Tails": who is more likely to win if they score 1 point per occurrence of their substring in a sequence of n fair coinflips? This attracted over 1 million views on X and quickly spawned several articles explaining the counterintuitive solution. We study the generalized game, where the set of coin outcomes, {Heads, Tails}, is generalized to an arbitrary finite alphabet A, and where Alice's and Bob's substrings are any finite A-strings of the same length. We find that the winner of Litt's game can be determined by a single quantity which measures the amount of prefix/suffix self-overlaps in each string; whoever's string has more overlaps loses. For example, "Heads-Tails" beats "Heads-Heads" in the original problem because "Heads-Heads" has a prefix/suffix overlap of length 1 while "Heads-Tails" has none. The method of proof is to develop a precise Edgeworth expansion for discreteMarkov chains, and apply this to calculate Alice's and Bob's probability to win the game correct to order O(1/n).</description>

      <title>Detecting Arbitrary Planted Subgraphs in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems of detecting and recovering planted structures/subgraphs in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, have received significant attention over the past three decades, leading to many exciting results and mathematical techniques. However, prior work has largely focused on specific ad hoc planted structures and inferential settings, while a general theory has remained elusive. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the detection of an \emph{arbitrary} planted subgraph $\Gamma = \Gamma_n$ in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n, q_n)$, where the edge probability within $\Gamma$ is $p_n$. We examine both the statistical and computational aspects of this problem and establish the following results. In the dense regime, where the edge probabilities $p_n$ and $q_n$ are fixed, we tightly characterize the information-theoretic and computational thresholds for detecting $\Gamma$, and provide conditions under which a computational-statistical gap arises. Most notably, these thresholds depend on $\Gamma$ only through its number of edges, maximum degree, and maximum subgraph density. Our lower and upper bounds are general and apply to any value of $p_n$ and $q_n$ as functions of $n$. Accordingly, we also analyze the sparse regime where $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$ and $p_n-q_n =\Theta(q_n)$, with $\alpha\in[0,2]$, as well as the critical regime where $p_n=1-o(1)$ and $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, both of which have been widely studied, for specific choices of $\Gamma$. For these regimes, we show that our bounds are tight for all planted subgraphs investigated in the literature thus far\textemdash{}and many more. Finally, we identify conditions under which detection undergoes sharp phase transition, where the boundaries at which algorithms succeed or fail shift abruptly as a function of $q_n$.</description>

      <title>The $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability of product networks under the PMC model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of neighbor connectivity originated from the assessment of the subversion of espionage networks caused by underground resistance movements, and it has now been applied to measure the disruption of networks caused by cascading failures through neighbors. In this paper, we give two necessary and sufficient conditions of the existance of $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability. We introduce a new concept called $g$-good neighbor cut-component number (gc number for short), which has close relation with $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability. Sharp lower and upper bounds of the gc number of general graphs in terms of the $g$-good neighbor connectivity is given, which provides a formula to compute the $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability for general graphs (therefore for Cartesian product graphs). As their applications, we get the exact values or bounds for the gc numbers and $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability of grid, torus networks and generalized cubes.</description>

Abstract: A \textit{grounded set family} on $I$ is a subset $\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^I$ such that $\emptyset\in\mathcal{F}$. We study a linearized Hopf monoid \textbf{SF} on grounded set families, with restriction and contraction inspired by the corresponding operations for antimatroids. Many known combinatorial species, including simplicial complexes and matroids, form Hopf submonoids of \textbf{SF}, although not always with the "standard" Hopf structure (for example, our contraction operation is not the usual contraction of matroids). We use the topological methods of Aguiar and Ardila to obtain a cancellation-free antipode formula for the Hopf submonoid of lattices of order ideals of finite posets. Furthermore, we prove that the Hopf algebra of lattices of order ideals of chain gangs extends the Hopf algebra of symmetric functions, and that its character group extends the group of formal power series in one variable with constant term 1 under multiplication.</description>

Abstract: We study different domination problems of attacking and non-attacking rooks and queens on polyominoes and polycubes of all dimensions. Our main result proves that maximum independent domination is NP-complete for non-attacking queens and for non-attacking rooks on polycubes of dimension three and higher. We also analyze these problems for polyominoes and convex polyominoes, conjecture the complexity classes, and provide a computer tool for investigation. We have also computed new values for classical queen domination problems on chessboards (square polyominoes). For our computations, we have translated the problem into an integer linear programming instance. Finally, using this computational implementation and the game engine Godot, we have developed a video game of minimum domination of queens and rooks on randomly generated polyominoes.</description>

Abstract: It is already known that order polytopes and chain polytopes are always 2-level polytopes. In general, this is not true for marked order and marked chain polytopes. We study the geometry of marked order polytopes, marked chain polytopes, and marked chain-order polytopes, providing a comprehensive characterisation of 2-levelness for these polytopes. Furthermore, we present an exact formula for the Ehrhart polynomial of marked order polytopes. Because of their connection to marked chain and marked chain-order polytopes, this polynomial is also the Ehrhart polynomial of these polytopes.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Vertex Enumeration of Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a state-of-the-art algorithm for the vertex enumeration problem of arrangements, which is based on the proposed new pivot rule, called the Zero rule. The Zero rule possesses several desirable properties: i) It gets rid of the objective function; ii) Its terminal satisfies uniqueness; iii) We establish the if-and-only if condition between the Zero rule and its valid reverse, which is not enjoyed by earlier rules; iv) Applying the Zero rule recursively definitely terminates in $d$ steps, where $d$ is the dimension of input variables. Because of so, given an arbitrary arrangement with $v$ vertices of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the algorithm's complexity is at most $\mathcal{O}(n^2d^2v)$ and can be as low as $\mathcal{O}(nd^4v)$ if it is a simple arrangement, while Moss' algorithm takes $\mathcal{O}(nd^2v^2)$, and Avis and Fukuda's algorithm goes into a loop or skips vertices because the if-and-only-if condition between the rule they chose and its valid reverse is not fulfilled. Systematic and comprehensive experiments confirm that the Zero rule not only does not fail but also is the most efficient.</description>

Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig (KL) and $Z$-polynomials of matroids. We formulate an equivariant generalization of a result by Braden and Vysogorets that relates the equivariant KL and $Z$-polynomials of a matroid with those of a single-element deletion. We also discuss the failure of equivariant $\gamma$-positivity for the $Z$-polynomial. As an application of our main result, we obtain a formula for the equivariant KL polynomial of the graphic matroid gotten by gluing two cycles. Furthermore, we compute the equivariant KL polynomials of all matroids of corank~$2$ via valuations. This provides an application of the machinery of Elias, Miyata, Proudfoot, and Vecchi to corank $2$ matroids, and it extends results of Ferroni and Schr\"oter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Schubert variety of a pair of linear subspaces in $\mathbf{C}^n$ and the external activity complex of a pair of not necessarily realizable matroids. Both of these generalize constructions of Ardila et al., which occur when one of the linear spaces is one-dimensional. We prove that our external activity complex is Cohen-Macaulay and deduce a formula for its $K$-polynomial in terms of exterior powers of the dual tautological quotient classes of matroids. As a consequence, we deduce a non-negative formula for the matroid invariant $\omega(M)$ of Fink, Shaw, and Speyer in terms of certain homology groups of links within an external activity complex, proving the 2005 tropical $f$-vector conjecture of Speyer.</description>

      <title>On some Grothendieck expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete flag variety admits a natural action by both the orthogonal group and the symplectic group. Wyser and Yong defined orthogonal Grothendieck polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ and symplectic Grothendieck polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{Sp}}_z$ as the $K$-theory classes of the corresponding orbit closures. There is an explicit formula to expand $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{Sp}}_z$ as a nonnegative sum of Grothendieck polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}_w$, which represent the $K$-theory classes of Schubert varieties. Although the constructions of $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{Sp}}_z$ and $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ are similar, finding the $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}$-expansion of $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ or even computing $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ is much harder. If $z$ is vexillary then $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ has a nonnegative $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}$-expansion, but the associated coefficients are mostly unknown. This paper derives several new formulas for $\mathfrak{G}^{\mathsf{O}}_z$ and its $\mathfrak{G}^{(\beta)}$-expansion when $z$ is vexillary. Among other applications, we prove that the latter expansion has a nontrivial stability property.</description>

      <title>Solving tiling enumeration problems by tensor network contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for computing the contraction of two-dimensional tensor networks on a square lattice; and we combine it with solving congruence equations to compute the exact enumeration (including weighted enumeration) of Wang tilings. Based on this, the paper demonstrates how to transform other tiling enumeration problems (such as those of polyominoes) into Wang tiling enumeration problems, thereby solving them using this algorithm.
  Our algorithm extends the sequence length records for dozens of sequences defined by polyomino tiling enumeration on chessboards on the OEIS website, covering numerous of different polyomino sets, including I-polyominoes, tetrominoes, pentominoes, etc. This demonstrates the high efficiency and strong universality of the algorithm for solving exact tiling enumeration problems.
  In addition, the theory and techniques used in the algorithm establish a bridge between tensor network contractions and tiling enumeration, where the former provides a theoretical foundation for solving problems in the latter, while the latter offers an intuitive combinatorial interpretation of the former.</description>

      <title>Permutons, meanders, and SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of random permutons which can be constructed from a pair of space-filling Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curves on a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface. This class includes the skew Brownian permutons introduced by Borga (2021), which describe the scaling limit of various types of random pattern-avoiding permutations. Another interesting permuton in our class is the meandric permuton, which corresponds to two independent SLE$_8$ curves on a $\gamma$-LQG surface with $\gamma = \sqrt{\frac13 \left( 17 - \sqrt{145} \right)}$. Building on work by Di Francesco, Golinelli, and Guitter (2000), we conjecture that the meandric permuton describes the scaling limit of uniform meandric permutations, i.e., the permutations induced by a simple loop in the plane which crosses a line a specified number of times.
  We show that for any sequence of random permutations which converges to one of the above random permutons, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is sublinear. This proves that the length of the longest increasing subsequence is sublinear for Baxter, strong-Baxter, and semi-Baxter permutations and leads to the conjecture that the same is true for meandric permutations. We also prove that the closed support of each of the random permutons in our class has Hausdorff dimension one. Finally, we prove a re-rooting invariance property for the meandric permuton and write down a formula for its expected pattern densities in terms of LQG correlation functions (which are known explicitly) and the probability that an SLE$_8$ hits a given set of points in numerical order (which is not known explicitly). We conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Realizing trees of hypergraphs in thin sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a continuous function, smooth away from the diagonal, such that, for some $\alpha&gt;0$, the associated generalized Radon transforms \begin{equation} \label{Radon} R_t^{\phi}f(x)=\int_{\phi(x,y)=t} f(y) \psi(y) d\sigma_{x,t}(y) \end{equation} map $L^2({\mathbb R}^d) \to H^{\alpha}({\mathbb R}^d)$ for all $t&gt;0$. Let $E$ be a compact subset of ${\mathbb R}^d$ for some $d \ge 2$, and suppose that the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is $&gt;d-\alpha$. Then any tree graph $T$ on $k+1$ ($k \ge 1$) vertices is realizable in $E$, in the sense that there exist distinct $x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1} \in E$ and $t&gt;0$ such that the $\phi$-distance $\phi(x^i, x^j)$ is equal to $t$ for all pairs $(i,j)$ corresponding to the edges of the graph $T$.
  We also extend this notion to hyper-graphs where points $x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1}$ are connected by a hyper-edge if $\phi(x^i,x^j)=t_{ij}$ for a set of pairs $(i,j)$ selected in accordance with a graph $H$, and $\{t_{ij}\}$ is a pre-assigned collection of positive distances. A chain of hyper-edges is a sequence $$\{(x^1_1, \dots, x^{k+1}_1), (x^1_2, \dots, x^{k+1}_2), \dots, (x^1_n,\dots, x^{k+1}_n)\},$$ where $(x^1_i, \dots, x^{k+1}_i)$ and $(x^1_{i+1}, \dots, x^{k+1}_{i+1})$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, share one and only one vertex $x^J_i$, with $J$ pre-assigned. A hyper-graph tree is defined analogously. The key estimate behind these arguments is a variant of (\ref{Radon}) where the average over the level set of $\phi(x,\cdot)$ is replaced by the average over an intersection of such surfaces. In the process, we develop a general graph theoretic paradigm that reduces a variety of point configuration questions to operator theoretic estimates.</description>

      <title>From total positivity to pure free resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Jacobi-Trudi identity as a base, we establish parallels between the theory of totally positive integer sequences and Koszul algebras. We then focus on the case of quadric hypersurface rings and use this parallel to construct new analogues of Schur modules. We investigate some of their Lie-theoretic properties (and in more detail in a followup article) and use them to construct pure free resolutions for quadric hypersurface rings which are completely analogous to the construction given by Eisenbud, Fl{\o}ystad, and Weyman in the case of polynomial rings.</description>

      <title>Lawvere's fourth open problem: Levels in the topos of symmetric simplicial sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the topos of simplicial sets, it makes sense to ask the following question about a given natural number $n$: what is the minimum value $m$ such that $n$-skeletality implies $m$-coskeletality? This is an instance of the Aufhebung relation in the sense of Lawvere, who introduced this notion for an arbitrary Grothendieck topos $\mathcal{E}$ in place of $\mathbf{sSet}$, and levels/essential subtopoi in place of dimensions.
  We compute this Aufhebung relation for the topos of symmetric simplicial sets. In particular, we show that it is given by $2l-1$ for the level labelled by $l\geq 3$, which coincides with the previously known case of simplicial sets. This result provides a solution to the fourth of the seven open problems in topos theory posed by Lawvere in 2009.</description>
