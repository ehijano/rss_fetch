      <title>Generative AI and Digital Neocolonialism in Global Education: Towards an Equitable Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02966v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically discusses how generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) might impose Western ideologies on non-Western societies, perpetuating digital neocolonialism in education through its inherent biases. It further suggests strategies for local and global stakeholders to mitigate these effects. Our discussions demonstrated that GenAI can foster cultural imperialism by generating content that primarily incorporates cultural references and examples relevant to Western students, thereby alienating students from non-Western backgrounds. Also, the predominant use of Western languages by GenAI can marginalize non-dominant languages, making educational content less accessible to speakers of indigenous languages and potentially impacting their ability to learn in their first language. Additionally, GenAI often generates content and curricula that reflect the perspectives of technologically dominant countries, overshadowing marginalized indigenous knowledge and practices. Moreover, the cost of access to GenAI intensifies educational inequality and the control of GenAI data could lead to commercial exploitation without benefiting local students and their communities. We propose human-centric reforms to prioritize cultural diversity and equity in GenAI development; a liberatory design to empower educators and students to identify and dismantle the oppressive structures within GenAI applications; foresight by design to create an adjustable GenAI system to meet future educational needs; and finally, effective prompting skills to reduce the retrieval of neocolonial outputs.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Approaches to Learning and Teaching Machine Learning in K-12 Education: Transparency, Ethics, and Design Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this conceptual paper, we review existing literature on artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) education to identify three approaches to how learning and teaching ML could be conceptualized. One of them, a data-driven approach, emphasizes providing young people with opportunities to create data sets, train, and test models. A second approach, learning algorithm-driven, prioritizes learning about how the learning algorithms or engines behind how ML models work. In addition, we identify efforts within a third approach that integrates the previous two. In our review, we focus on how the approaches: (1) glassbox and blackbox different aspects of ML, (2) build on learner interests and provide opportunities for designing applications, (3) integrate ethics and justice. In the discussion, we address the challenges and opportunities of current approaches and suggest future directions for the design of learning activities.</description>

      <title>Building Socially-Equitable Public Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public models offer predictions to a variety of downstream tasks and have played a crucial role in various AI applications, showcasing their proficiency in accurate predictions. However, the exclusive emphasis on prediction accuracy may not align with the diverse end objectives of downstream agents. Recognizing the public model's predictions as a service, we advocate for integrating the objectives of downstream agents into the optimization process. Concretely, to address performance disparities and foster fairness among heterogeneous agents in training, we propose a novel Equitable Objective. This objective, coupled with a policy gradient algorithm, is crafted to train the public model to produce a more equitable/uniform performance distribution across downstream agents, each with their unique concerns. Both theoretical analysis and empirical case studies have proven the effectiveness of our method in advancing performance equity across diverse downstream agents utilizing the public model for their decision-making. Codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/Ren-Research/Socially-Equitable-Public-Models.</description>

      <title>Promotional Language and the Adoption of Innovative Ideas in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How are the merits of innovative ideas communicated in science? Here we conduct semantic analyses of grant application success with a focus on scientific promotional language, which has been growing in frequency in many contexts and purportedly may convey an innovative idea's originality and significance. Our analysis attempts to surmount limitations of prior studies by examining the full text of tens of thousands of both funded and unfunded grants from three leading public and private funding agencies: the NIH, the NSF, and the Novo Nordisk Foundation, one of the world's largest private science foundations. We find a robust association between promotional language and the support and adoption of innovative ideas by funders and other scientists. First, the percentage of promotional language in a grant proposal is associated with up to a doubling of the grant's probability of being funded. Second, a grant's promotional language reflects its intrinsic level of innovativeness. Third, the percentage of promotional language predicts the expected citation and productivity impact of publications that are supported by funded grants. Lastly, a computer-assisted experiment that manipulates the promotional language in our data demonstrates how promotional language can communicate the merit of ideas through cognitive activation. With the incidence of promotional language in science steeply rising, and the pivotal role of grants in converting promising and aspirational ideas into solutions, our analysis provides empirical evidence that promotional language is associated with effectively communicating the merits of innovative scientific ideas.</description>

      <title>Ethical considerations of use of hold-out sets in clinical prediction model management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical prediction models are statistical or machine learning models used to quantify the risk of a certain health outcome using patient data. These can then inform potential interventions on patients, causing an effect called performative prediction: predictions inform interventions which influence the outcome they were trying to predict, leading to a potential underestimation of risk in some patients if a model is updated on this data. One suggested resolution to this is the use of hold-out sets, in which a set of patients do not receive model derived risk scores, such that a model can be safely retrained. We present an overview of clinical and research ethics regarding potential implementation of hold-out sets for clinical prediction models in health settings. We focus on the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice. We also discuss informed consent, clinical equipoise, and truth-telling. We present illustrative cases of potential hold-out set implementations and discuss statistical issues arising from different hold-out set sampling methods. We also discuss differences between hold-out sets and randomised control trials, in terms of ethics and statistical issues. Finally, we give practical recommendations for researchers interested in the use hold-out sets for clinical prediction models.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Estimating Support for U.S. Presidential Candidates in Twitter Polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polls posted on social media have emerged in recent years as an important tool for estimating public opinion, e.g., to gauge public support for business decisions and political candidates in national elections. Here, we examine nearly two thousand Twitter polls gauging support for U.S. presidential candidates during the 2016 and 2020 election campaigns. First, we describe the rapidly emerging prevalence of social polls. Second, we characterize social polls in terms of their heterogeneity and response options. Third, leveraging machine learning models for user attribute inference, we describe the demographics, political leanings, and other characteristics of the users who author and interact with social polls. Finally, we study the relationship between social poll results, their attributes, and the characteristics of users interacting with them. Our findings reveal that Twitter polls are biased in various ways, starting from the position of the presidential candidates among the poll options to biases in demographic attributes and poll results. The 2016 and 2020 polls were predominantly crafted by older males and manifested a pronounced bias favoring candidate Donald Trump, in contrast to traditional surveys, which favored Democratic candidates. We further identify and explore the potential reasons for such biases in social polling and discuss their potential repercussions. Finally, we show that biases in social media polls can be corrected via regression and poststratification. The errors of the resulting election estimates can be as low as 1%-2%, suggesting that social media polls can become a promising source of information about public opinion.</description>

      <title>Right to be Forgotten in the Era of Large Language Models: Implications, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Right to be Forgotten (RTBF) was first established as the result of the ruling of Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v AEPD, Mario Costeja Gonz\'alez, and was later included as the Right to Erasure under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of European Union to allow individuals the right to request personal data be deleted by organizations. Specifically for search engines, individuals can send requests to organizations to exclude their information from the query results. It was a significant emergent right as the result of the evolution of technology. With the recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their use in chatbots, LLM-enabled software systems have become popular. But they are not excluded from the RTBF. Compared with the indexing approach used by search engines, LLMs store, and process information in a completely different way. This poses new challenges for compliance with the RTBF. In this paper, we explore these challenges and provide our insights on how to implement technical solutions for the RTBF, including the use of differential privacy, machine unlearning, model editing, and guardrails. With the rapid advancement of AI and the increasing need of regulating this powerful technology, learning from the case of RTBF can provide valuable lessons for technical practitioners, legal experts, organizations, and authorities.</description>

      <title>Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents, called scientific LLM agents, also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations to address these issues effectively.</description>

      <title>Will we run out of data? Limits of LLM scaling based on human-generated data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential constraints on LLM scaling posed by the availability of public human-generated text data. We forecast the growing demand for training data based on current trends and estimate the total stock of public human text data. Our findings indicate that if current LLM development trends continue, models will be trained on datasets roughly equal in size to the available stock of public human text data between 2026 and 2032, or slightly earlier if models are overtrained. We explore how progress in language modeling can continue when human-generated text datasets cannot be scaled any further. We argue that synthetic data generation, transfer learning from data-rich domains, and data efficiency improvements might support further progress.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Infer Psychological Dispositions of Social Media Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly human-like abilities across a wide variety of tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs like ChatGPT can accurately infer the psychological dispositions of social media users and whether their ability to do so varies across socio-demographic groups. Specifically, we test whether GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can derive the Big Five personality traits from users' Facebook status updates in a zero-shot learning scenario. Our results show an average correlation of r = .29 (range = [.22, .33]) between LLM-inferred and self-reported trait scores - a level of accuracy that is similar to that of supervised machine learning models specifically trained to infer personality. Our findings also highlight heterogeneity in the accuracy of personality inferences across different age groups and gender categories: predictions were found to be more accurate for women and younger individuals on several traits, suggesting a potential bias stemming from the underlying training data or differences in online self-expression. The ability of LLMs to infer psychological dispositions from user-generated text has the potential to democratize access to cheap and scalable psychometric assessments for both researchers and practitioners. On the one hand, this democratization might facilitate large-scale research of high ecological validity and spark innovation in personalized services. On the other hand, it also raises ethical concerns regarding user privacy and self-determination, highlighting the need for stringent ethical frameworks and regulation.</description>

      <title>Networked Inequality: Preferential Attachment Bias in Graph Neural Network Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) link prediction is increasingly deployed in citation, collaboration, and online social networks to recommend academic literature, collaborators, and friends. While prior research has investigated the dyadic fairness of GNN link prediction, the within-group (e.g., queer women) fairness and "rich get richer" dynamics of link prediction remain underexplored. However, these aspects have significant consequences for degree and power imbalances in networks. In this paper, we shed light on how degree bias in networks affects Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) link prediction. In particular, we theoretically uncover that GCNs with a symmetric normalized graph filter have a within-group preferential attachment bias. We validate our theoretical analysis on real-world citation, collaboration, and online social networks. We further bridge GCN's preferential attachment bias with unfairness in link prediction and propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric quantifies disparities in link prediction scores within social groups, towards combating the amplification of degree and power disparities. Finally, we propose a simple training-time strategy to alleviate within-group unfairness, and we show that it is effective on citation, social, and credit networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This scoping review explores the ethical challenges of using ChatGPT in higher education. By reviewing recent academic articles in English, Chinese, and Japanese, we aimed to provide a deep dive review and identify gaps in the literature. Drawing on Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) scoping review framework, we defined search terms and identified relevant publications from four databases in the three target languages. The research results showed that the majority of the papers were discussion papers, but there was some early empirical work. The ethical issues highlighted in these works mainly concern academic integrity, assessment issues, and data protection. Given the rapid deployment of generative artificial intelligence, it is imperative for educators to conduct more empirical studies to develop sound ethical policies for its use.</description>

      <title>Representation Surgery: Theory and Practice of Affine Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09631v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models often exhibit undesirable behavior, e.g., generating toxic or gender-biased text. In the case of neural language models, an encoding of the undesirable behavior is often present in the model's representations. Thus, one natural (and common) approach to prevent the model from exhibiting undesirable behavior is to steer the model's representations in a manner that reduces the probability of it generating undesirable text. This paper investigates the formal and empirical properties of steering functions, i.e., transformation of the neural language model's representations that alter its behavior. First, we derive two optimal, in the least-squares sense, affine steering functions under different constraints. Our theory provides justification for existing approaches and offers a novel, improved steering approach. Second, we offer a series of experiments that demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the methods in mitigating bias and reducing toxic generation.</description>

      <title>The AI Community Building the Future? A Quantitative Analysis of Development Activity on Hugging Face Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open model developers have emerged as key actors in the political economy of artificial intelligence (AI), but we still have a limited understanding of collaborative practices in the open AI ecosystem. This paper responds to this gap with a three-part quantitative analysis of development activity on the Hugging Face (HF) Hub, a popular platform for building, sharing, and demonstrating models. First, various types of activity across 348,181 model, 65,761 dataset, and 156,642 space repositories exhibit right-skewed distributions. Activity is extremely imbalanced between repositories; for example, over 70% of models have 0 downloads, while 1% account for 99% of downloads. Furthermore, licenses matter: there are statistically significant differences in collaboration patterns in model repositories with permissive, restrictive, and no licenses. Second, we analyse a snapshot of the social network structure of collaboration in model repositories, finding that the community has a core-periphery structure, with a core of prolific developers and a majority of isolate developers (89%). Upon removing the isolate developers from the network, collaboration is characterised by high reciprocity regardless of developers' network positions. Third, we examine model adoption through the lens of model usage in spaces, finding that a minority of models, developed by a handful of companies, are widely used on the HF Hub. Overall, activity on the HF Hub is characterised by Pareto distributions, congruent with OSS development patterns on platforms like GitHub. We conclude with recommendations for researchers, companies, and policymakers to advance our understanding of open AI development.</description>

      <title>Intersectional Unfairness Discovery</title>

Abstract: AI systems have been shown to produce unfair results for certain subgroups of population, highlighting the need to understand bias on certain sensitive attributes. Current research often falls short, primarily focusing on the subgroups characterized by a single sensitive attribute, while neglecting the nature of intersectional fairness of multiple sensitive attributes. This paper focuses on its one fundamental aspect by discovering diverse high-bias subgroups under intersectional sensitive attributes. Specifically, we propose a Bias-Guided Generative Network (BGGN). By treating each bias value as a reward, BGGN efficiently generates high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes. Experiments on real-world text and image datasets demonstrate a diverse and efficient discovery of BGGN. To further evaluate the generated unseen but possible unfair intersectional sensitive attributes, we formulate them as prompts and use modern generative AI to produce new texts and images. The results of frequently generating biased data provides new insights of discovering potential unfairness in popular modern generative AI systems. Warning: This paper contains generative examples that are offensive in nature.</description>

      <title>Resource-constrained Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Access to resources strongly constrains the decisions we make. While we might wish to offer every student a scholarship, or schedule every patient for follow-up meetings with a specialist, limited resources mean that this is not possible. Existing tools for fair machine learning ignore these key constraints, with the majority of methods disregarding any finite resource limitations under which decisions are made. Our research introduces the concept of "resource-constrained fairness" and quantifies the cost of fairness within this framework. We demonstrate that the level of available resources significantly influences this cost, a factor that has been overlooked in previous evaluations.</description>
