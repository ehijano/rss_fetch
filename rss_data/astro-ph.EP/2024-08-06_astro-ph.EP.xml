      <title>Accreting companion occurrence rates using a new method to compute emission-line survey sensitivity: Application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alpha line luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-8&lt; log MMdot MJ^2/yr &lt; -2) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Across accretion models, we find consistent accreting companion rates, with median and one-sigma credible intervals of 0.15 (+0.18, -0.10) and 0.19 (+0.23, -0.12). Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Keck-HGCA Pilot Survey II: Direct Imaging Discovery of HD 63754 B, a ~20 au Massive Companion Near the Hydrogen Burning Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the joint astrometric and direct imaging discovery, mass measurement, and orbital analysis of HD 63754 B (HIP 38216 B), a companion near the stellar-substellar boundary orbiting ~20 AU from its Sun-like host. HD 63754 was observed in our ongoing high-contrast imaging survey targeting stars with significant proper-motion accelerations between Hipparcos and Gaia consistent with wide-separation substellar companions. We utilized archival HIRES and HARPS radial velocity (RV) data, together with the host star's astrometric acceleration extracted from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA), to predict the location of the candidate companion around HD 63754 A. We subsequently imaged HD 63754 B at its predicted location using the Near Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2) in the $L'$ band at the W. M. Keck Observatory. We then jointly modeled the orbit of HD 63754 B with RVs, Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations, and our new relative astrometry, measuring a dynamical mass of ${81.9}_{-5.8}^{+6.4} M_{jup}$, an eccentricity of ${0.260}_{-0.059}^{+0.065}$, and a nearly face-on inclination of $174.81_{-0.50}^{+0.48}$ degrees. For HD 63754 B, we obtain an L' band absolute magnitude of $L' = 11.39\pm0.06$ mag, from which we infer a bolometric luminosity of $log(L_{bol}/L_{\odot})= -4.55 \pm0.08$ dex using a comparison sample of L and T dwarfs with measured luminosities. Although uncertainties linger in age and dynamical mass estimates, our analysis points toward HD 63754 B's identity as a brown dwarf on the L/T transition rather than a low-mass star, indicated by its inferred bolometric luminosity and model-estimated effective temperature. Future RV, spectroscopic, and astrometric data such as those from JWST and Gaia DR4 will clarify HD 63754 B's mass, and enable spectral typing and atmospheric characterization.</description>

      <title>The pre-perihelion evolution of the activity of comet C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) during the water ice-line crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comets, relics from the early solar system, consist of dust and ice. The ice sublimates as comets approach the Sun, ejecting dust from their nuclei seen as activity. Different volatiles sublimate at different Sun-comet distances and eject dust of unique sizes, structures, and compositions. In this study, we present new polarimetric observations of Oort-cloud comet C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) in R and I-filter domains before, during, and after its crossover of the water-ice sublimation regime at phase angles of 15.9\arcdeg, 10.5\arcdeg, and 20.0\arcdeg, respectively. Combining multiband optical imaging data covering a wide range of heliocentric distances ($\sim$14$-$2.3 au), we aim to characterize the preperihelion evolution of cometary activity as well as the properties of its coma dust. Two discontinuous brightening events were observed: at $\sim$6 au presumably associated with changes in CO-like supervolatile ice activity, and at $\sim$2.9 au when water ice took over. Particularly, the latter activation is accompanied by changes in coma morphology and color whose trends differ between the inner ($\sim$10$^3$-km) and outer ($\sim$10$^4$-km) parts of the coma. No polarimetric discontinuities on the comet were observed over the inner coma region, all epochs showing phase-angle and wavelength dependencies compatible with those of active comets observed in similar observing geometry. During this period, the underlying dust continuum overwhelmed H$\alpha$ emission at around 656.3 nm, suggesting less water ice on the comet's surface than expected. We discuss K2's coma environment by combining numerical simulations of light scattered by dust and place the observations within the context of the comet's evolution.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of Magnetic Effects on Zonal Flows in Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter and Saturn exhibit alternating east-west jet streams as seen from surface. The origin of these zonal flows has been debated for decades. The high-precision gravity measurements by Juno mission and the grand finale of Cassini mission have revealed that the zonal flows observed at the surface may extend several thousand kilometres deep and stop around the transition region from molecular to metallic hydrogen, suggesting the magnetic braking effect on zonal flows. In this study, we perform a set of magnetohydrodynamic simulations in a spherical shell with radially variable electrical conductivity to investigate the interaction between magnetic fields and zonal flows. A key feature of our numerical models is that we impose a background dipole magnetic field on the anelastic rotating convection. By varying the strength of the imposed magnetic field and the vigor of convection, we investigate how the magnetic field interacts with the convective motions and the convection-driven zonal flows. Our simulations reveal that the magnetic field tends to destroy zonal flows in the metallic hydrogen and suppress zonal flows in the molecular envelope, while the magnetic field may enhance the radial convective motions. We extract a quantitative relation between the magnetic field strength and the amplitude of zonal flows at the surface through our simulations, which roughly matches the observed magnetic field and zonal wind speed of Jupiter and Saturn. This discovery provides support from a new perspective for the scenario of deep convection-driven zonal winds which are confined to the molecular hydrogen layers in giant planets.</description>

      <title>Streaming Torque in Dust-Gas Coupled Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the migration of low-mass protoplanets embedded in dust-gas coupled protoplanetary disks. Linear calculations are performed with respect to the NSH (Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi 1986) equilibrium within a shearing sheet. We find that the dusty quasi-drift mode dominates the dynamical behaviors in close proximity to the protoplanet. This mode exhibits an extremely short radial wavelength, characterized by a dispersion relation of $ \tilde{\omega} = \left( 1 + \mu \right) \boldsymbol{W}_s \cdot \boldsymbol{k}$. The emergence of this mode leads to a wake with a short radial length-scale ahead of protoplanets, contributing to a positive torque, termed as ``Streaming Torque (ST)''. Furthermore, both Lindblad torque and corotation torque are affected by the NSH velocity. The total torque and planetary migration are contingent upon the coupling strength between dust and gas. In most scenarios, ST predominates, inducing outward migration for planets, thereby addressing the issue of rapid inward migration in their formation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Searching for Neutral Hydrogen Escape from the 120 Myr Old Sub-Neptune HIP94235b using HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIP94235 b, a 120 Myr old sub-Neptune, provides us the unique opportunity to study mass loss at a pivotal stage of the system's evolution: the end of a 100 million year (Myr) old phase of intense XUV irradiation. We present two observations of HIP94235 b using the Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) in the Ly-alpha wavelength region. We do not observe discernible differences across either the blue and red wings of the Ly-alpha line profile in and out of transit, and report no significant detection of outflowing neutral hydrogen around the planet. We constrain the rate of neutral hydrogen escaping HIP94235 b to an upper limit of 10^13 g/s, which remains consistent with energy-limited model predictions of 10^11 g/s. The Ly-alpha non-detection is likely due to the extremely short photoionization timescale of the neutral hydrogen escaping the planet's atmosphere. This timescale, approximately 15 minutes, is significantly shorter than that of any other planets with STIS observations. Through energy-limited mass loss models, we anticipate that HIP94235 b will transition into a super-Earth within a timescale of 1 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Plasma Composition of 67P/C-G at different Heliocentric Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rosetta spacecraft accompanied the comet 67P/C-G for nearly 2 years, collecting valuable data on the neutral and ion composition of the coma. The Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) provided continuous measurements of the in situ plasma density while ROSINA-COPS monitored the neutral composition. In this work, we aim to estimate the composition of the cometary ionosphere at different heliocentric distances of the comet. Lauter et al. (2020) derived the temporal evolution of the volatile sublimation rates for 50 separated time intervals on the orbit of 67P/C-G using the COPS and DFMS data. We use these sublimation rates as inputs in a multifluid chemical-hydrodynamical model for 36 of the time intervals for heliocentric distances &lt; 3 au. We compare the total ion densities obtained from our models with the local plasma density measured by the RPC instruments. We find that at the location of the spacecraft, our modeled ion densities match with the in situ measured plasma density within factors of 1 - 3 for many of the time intervals. We obtain the cometocentric distance variation of the ions H2O+ and H3O+ and the ion groups created respectively by the ionization and protonation of neutral species. We see that H3O+ is dominant at the spacecraft location for nearly all the time intervals while ions created due to protonation are dominant at low cometocentric distances for the intervals near perihelion. We also discuss our ion densities in the context of their detection by DFMS.</description>

      <title>Rossby wave instability in weakly ionized protoplanetary disks. II. radial B-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our first paper in this series, we investigate the impact of radial magnetic fields and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects - specifically, Ohmic resistivity, Hall drift, and ambipolar diffusion - on RWI unstable modes. The presence of a radial field is linked to the disk's vertical shear and vertical magnetic field. We perform radially global linear analyses and utilize the spectral code \textsc{Dedalus} to solve the matrix eigenvalue problems. Our findings reveal that radial fields exhibit behavior similar to vertical fields. In the ideal MHD limit, radial fields enhance the effect of vertical fields in reducing growth rates, with significant reductions starting at relatively weak field strengths, around $\beta \sim 10^3 - 10^4$, which are relevant to protoplanetary disks. In the non-ideal MHD limit, all three non-ideal effects, when sufficiently strong, cause the growth rates to closely resemble those observed in hydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>The GRAVITY young stellar object survey XIV : Investigating the magnetospheric accretion-ejection processes in S CrA N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dust- and gas-rich protoplanetary disks around young stellar systems play a key role in star and planet formation. While considerable progress has recently been made in probing these disks on large scales of a few tens of astronomical units (au), the central au needs to be more investigated. We aim at unveiling the physical processes at play in the innermost regions of the strongly accreting T Tauri Star S CrA N by means of near-infrared interferometric observations. The K-band continuum emission is well reproduced with an azimuthally-modulated dusty ring. As the star alone cannot explain the size of this sublimation front, we propose that magnetospheric accretion is an important dust-heating mechanism leading to this continuum emission. The differential analysis of the Hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line is in agreement with radiative transfer models combining magnetospheric accretion and disk winds. Our observations support an origin of the Br$\gamma$ line from a combination of (variable) accretion-ejection processes in the inner disk region.</description>

      <title>Breaking Giant Chains: Early-Stage Instabilities in Long-Period Giant Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital evolution is a critical process that sculpts planetary systems, particularly during their early stages where planet-disk interactions are expected to lead to the formation of resonant chains. Despite the theoretically expected prominence of such configurations, they are scarcely observed among long-period giant exoplanets. This disparity suggests an evolutionary sequence wherein giant planet systems originate in compact multiresonant configurations, but subsequently become unstable, eventually relaxing to wider orbits--a phenomenon mirrored in our own solar system's early history. In this work, we present a suite of N-body simulations that model the instability-driven evolution of giant planet systems, originating from resonant initial conditions, through phases of disk dispersal and beyond. By comparing the period ratio and normalized angular momentum distributions of our synthetic aggregate of systems with the observational census of long-period Jovian planets, we derive constraints on the expected rate of orbital migration, the efficiency of gas-driven eccentricity damping, and typical initial multiplicity. Our findings reveal a distinct inclination toward densely packed initial conditions, weak damping, and high giant planet multiplicities. Furthermore, our models indicate that resonant chain origins do not facilitate the formation of Hot Jupiters via the coplanar high-eccentricity pathway at rates high enough to explain their observed prevalence.</description>
