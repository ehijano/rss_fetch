      <title>A classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ for a prime $p\geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A map is a cellular decomposition of a closed surface. In the framework of classifying all regular maps by their supporting surface, it is an open problem to find all closed surfaces that support no regular maps. Classification of regular maps on surfaces with Euler characteristic $-p, -p^2, -p^3, -2p,$ and $-3p$ has already been done by several authors in a series of papers, which also show that surfaces with these Euler characteristic support no regular maps if the corresponding prime $p$ satisfies certain conditions. In this paper, assuming that $p\geq 5$ is a prime and $i\geq 4$, we show that the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a regular map with Euler characteristic $-p^i$ is bounded by $p^{i-1}$ unless $p\in \{5, 7, 13\}$, and we show the existence of a normal $p$-subgroup for these regular maps whenever a Sylow $p$-subgroup has order at least $\sqrt{p^i}$, laying a solid foundation for using an inductive method to completely characterize regular maps of Euler characteristic $-p^i$. Based on this, we classify all regular maps with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ for a prime $p\geq 5$ in terms of reduced presentations of their automorphism groups. Consequently, a closed surface with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ supports no regular maps if and only if $p\notin \{2,3,5,7,13\}$.</description>

      <title>Selected facts on products of two involutions in the Riordan group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An element of a group is called \emph{reversible} if it is conjugate to its inverse, and \emph{strongly reversible} if it can be expressed as a product of two involutions. We study strongly reversible elements in the Riordan group and in several of its important subgroups. We show that not every reversible element in the Riordan group is strongly reversible, and we investigate products of reversible elements in the Riordan group.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with a large normalized sum of element orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, let $\psi(G)$ be the sum of the orders of its elements, and define the corresponding normalized sum as $\psi'(G) := \psi(G)/\psi(\mathcal{C}_{|G|})$, where $\mathcal{C}_{|G|}$ is the cyclic group of the same order as $G$. Inspired by analogous criteria for the classes of soluble, supersoluble, and nilpotent groups, our main result establishes that if $\psi'(G)&gt;\psi'(D_8) = \frac{19}{43}$, then $G$ belongs to the well-understood class of groups with a modular subgroup lattice, whose structure theory allows us to readily identify all groups satisfying this bound. Moreover, the equality case is fully settled. Finally, our arguments lead to a complete description of all groups satisfying $\psi'(G)&gt; \psi'(A_4) = \frac{31}{77}$, thereby fully determining the groups covered by the supersolubility criterion of Baniasad Azad and Khosravi [Canad. Math. Bull. 65 (2022), 30--38], and thus providing a more complete answer to a corresponding conjecture of T\v{a}rn\v{a}uceanu.</description>

      <title>Skeleton Key: Subduction Classes in Finite Transformation Semigroups and Green's Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4224</link>
      <description>arXiv:1401.4224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish key connections between Green's $\cal J$- and $\cal L$-relations on a finite semigroup and the subduction relation defined on the image sets of an action of the same semigroup when it acts faithfully on a finite set. The construction of the skeleton order, the partial order on equivalence classes of the subduction relation, is shown to depend in a functorial way on transformation semigroups and surjective morphisms, and to factor through the Green's $\leq_{\cal L}$-order and $\leq_{\cal J}$-order on the semigroup and through the inclusion order on image sets. For right regular representations, the correspondence between the $\cal J$-class order and the skeleton order is one of isomorphism. Finally, we characterize the relationship between natural subsystems of a transformation semigroup, permutator groups and the $\cal H$-relation.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Structure for Many Hierarchically Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combinatorial hierarchical hyperbolicity criterion is a very useful way of constructing new hierarchically hyperbolic spaces (HHSs). We show that, conversely, HHSs satisfying natural assumptions (satisfied, for example, by mapping class groups) admit a combinatorial HHS structure. This can be useful in constructions of new HHSs, and also our construction clarifies how to apply the combinatorial HHS criterion to suspected examples. We also uncover connections between HHS notions and lattice theory notions.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Groups of the $PSL_2(q)$ Commuting Involution Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$ and a conjugacy class of involutions $X$ of $G$, we define the commuting involution graph $\mathcal{C}(G,X)$ to be the graph with vertex set $X$ and $x,y \in X$ adjacent if and only if $x \neq y$ and $xy =yx$. In this paper the automorphism group of the graph $\mathcal{C}(G,X)$ is determined when $G = PSL_2(q)$.</description>

      <title>On the abstract elementary class of acts with embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the class of acts with embeddings as an abstract elementary class. We show that the class is always stable and show that superstability in the class is characterized algebraically via weakly noetherian monoids.
  The study of these model-theoretic notions and limit models lead us to introduce parametized weakly noetherian monoids and find a characterization of them via parametrized injective acts. Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of weakly noetherian monoids via absolutely pure acts extending a classical result of ring theory.
  The paper is aimed at algebraists and model theorists so an effort was made to provide the background for both.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of systolic and Helly complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that finite (weakly) systolic and Helly complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). Furthermore, Helly complexes and 2-dimensional systolic complexes can be reconstructed by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with respect to the number of vertices of the complex. Both results can be viewed as a positive contribution to a general question of Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2025). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete analogue of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} /m \mathbb{Z}} \mathfrak{g}_i$ be a periodically graded semisimple complex Lie algebra. In this note, we give a uniform proof of the recent result by W. de Graaf and H. V. L\^e that the hyperplane arrangement determined by the restrictions of the roots of $\mathfrak{g}$ to a Cartan subspace $\mathfrak{c} \subset \mathfrak{g}_1$ coincides with the hyperplane arrangement of (complex) reflections of the little Weyl group of $\mathfrak{g} = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z} /m \mathbb{Z}} \mathfrak{g}_i$.</description>

      <title>Relations between values and zeros of irreducible characters of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove certain polynomial relations between the values of complex irreducible characters of general finite symmetric groups. We use it to find some sets of conjugacy classes such that no finite symmetric group has a complex irreducible character that vanishes at every class in the set. In particular, we show that if $n$ satisfies certain conditions, then $S_n\setminus \{1\}$ cannot be covered by the set of zeros of three irreducible characters. We also prove that the values of character of $2$-defect zero can be expressed as rational functions in $n$, and build a recursive algorithm to find these rational functions. As another application, we improve a result by A. Miller on identification of irreducible characters by checking small number of values.</description>
