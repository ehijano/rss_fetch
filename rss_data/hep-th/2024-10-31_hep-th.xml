      <title>From data to the analytic S-matrix: A Bootstrap fit of the pion scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to fit experimental data using a UV complete amplitude ansatz satisfying the constraints of Analyticity, Crossing, and Unitarity. We focus on $\pi\pi$ scattering combining both experimental and lattice data. The fit strategy requires using S-matrix Bootstrap methods and non-convex Particle Swarm Optimization techniques. Using this procedure, we numerically construct a full-fledged scattering amplitude that fits the data and contains the known QCD spectrum that couples to $\pi \pi$ states below $1.4$ GeV. The amplitude constructed agrees below the two-particle threshold with the two-loop $\chi$PT prediction. Moreover, we correctly predict the $D_2$ phase shift, the appearance of a spin three state, and the behavior of the high-energy total cross-section. Finally, we find a genuine tetraquark resonance around 2 GeV, which we argue might be detected by looking into the decays of B mesons.</description>

      <title>Spread Complexity Rate as Proper Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a precise relation between the rate of complexity of quantum states excited by local operators in two-dimensional conformal field theories and the radial momentum of particles in 3-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Similar relations have been anticipated based on qualitative models for operator growth. Here, we make this correspondence sharp with two key ingredients: the precise definition of quantum complexity given by the spread complexity of states, and the match of its growth rate to the bulk momentum measured in the proper radial distance coordinate.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the complexity of quantum field theories (QFTs) by proposing a measure of information contained in a QFT and its observables. We show that from minimal assertions, one is naturally led to measure complexity by two integers, called format and degree, which characterize the information content of the functions and domains required to specify a theory or an observable. The strength of this proposal is that it applies to any physical quantity, and can therefore be used for analyzing complexities within an individual QFT, as well as studying the entire space of QFTs. We discuss the physical interpretation of our approach in the context of perturbation theory, symmetries, and the renormalization group. Key applications include the detection of complexity reductions in observables, for example due to algebraic relations, and understanding the emergence of simplicity when considering limits. The mathematical foundations of our constructions lie in the framework of sharp o-minimality, which ensures that the proposed complexity measure exhibits general properties inferred from consistency and universality.</description>

      <title>Double Copy in AdS3 from Minitwistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double copy relates gravitational theories to the square of gauge theories. While it is well understood in flat backgrounds, its precise realisation around curved spacetimes remains an open question. In this paper, we construct a classical double copy for cohomology class representatives in the minitwistor space of hyperbolic spacetimes. We find that the realisation of a physical double copy requires that the masses of the different spinning fields are not equal, contrary to the flat space prescription. This leads to a position-space double copy for bulk-to-boundary propagators. We also show that in coordinate space, this implies the Cotton double copy for waves and warped black holes of Topologically Massive Gravity. We show that these are exact double copy relations by constructing their Kerr-Schild metrics and also analysing the Kerr-Schild double copy. Furthermore, we find that near the boundary the double copy relates the dual CFT currents.</description>

      <title>Cheshire $\theta$ terms, Aharonov-Bohm effects, and axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss unusual $\theta$ terms that can appear in field theories that allow global vortices. These `Cheshire $\theta$ terms' induce Aharonov-Bohm effects for some particles that move around vortices. For example, a Cheshire $\theta$ term can appear in QCD coupled to an axion and induces Aharonov-Bohm effects for baryons and leptons moving around axion strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-point function of protected dimension-1 operators in ABJM up to two loops in dimensional regularization. The result exhibits uniform transcendentality empirically, which we conjecture to hold at all orders. We leverage this property to streamline the reconstruction of the dimensional regularization expansion of master integrals in terms of bases of Euler sums of uniform transcendental weight.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-induced effective coupling in SYK chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum chains have recently been considered in the context of developing novel discrete realizations of holographic dualities. To advance this programme, we explore the ground states of infinite chains with large number $N$ of Majorana fermions on each site, which interact via on-site $q$-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) couplings, as well as via additional inhomogeneous hopping terms between nearest-neighbour sites. The hopping parameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach unifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a real-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots linked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between their neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the large $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description in terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we obtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that we consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of wormholes. This amounts to a local near-boundary description of the bulk geometry in the context of discrete holography.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of static black holes in anti-de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers of anti-de Sitter black holes are understood as linear response coefficients governing how the holographically dual plasma polarizes when the geometry of the space, in which the plasma lives, is deformed. So far, this picture has been applied only to black branes with plane wave perturbations. We fill the gap in the literature by performing the computation of tidal Love numbers for the four-dimensional Schwarzschild solution in global anti-de Sitter, which is dual to a conformal plasma on $S^2$. We conclude about the effect of the bulk gravitational perturbations on the boundary metric and stress tensor, responsible for the geometric polarization. The computation of the tidal Love numbers is performed in both Regge-Wheeler gauge and the Kodama-Ishibashi gauge-invariant approach. We spell out how to convert the tidal Love numbers determined in these two formalisms and find perfect agreement. We also relate the Kodama- Ishibashi formalism with the Kovtun-Starinets approach, which is particularly well suited for the holographic analysis of black branes. This allows us to compare with the tidal Love number results for black branes in anti-de Sitter, also finding agreement in the relevant regime.</description>

      <title>From Black Strings to Fundamental Strings: Non-uniformity and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the transition between black strings and fundamental strings in the presence of a compact dimension, $\mathbb{S}^1_z$. In particular, we study the Horowitz-Polchinski effective field theory in $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{S}^1_z$, with a reduction on the Euclidean time circle $\mathbb{S}_\tau^1$. The classical solution of this theory describes a bound state of self-gravitating strings, known as a ``string star'', in Lorentzian spacetime. By analyzing non-uniform perturbations to the uniform solution, we identify the critical mass at which the string star becomes unstable towards non-uniformity along the spatial circle (i.e., Gregory-Laflamme instability) and determine the order of the associated phase transition. For $3\le d&lt;4$, we argue that at the critical mass, the uniform string star can transition into a localized black hole. More generally, we describe the sequence of transitions from a large uniform black string as its mass decreases, depending on the number of dimensions $d$. Additionally, using the $SL(2)_k/U(1)$ model in string theory, we show that for sufficiently large $d$, the uniform black string is stable against non-uniformity before transitioning into fundamental strings. We also present a novel solution that exhibits double winding symmetry breaking in the asymptotically $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{S}^1_\tau\times\mathbb{S}^1_z$ Euclidean spacetime.</description>

      <title>Topological 4D gravity and gravitational defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS3 gravity as well as the Costello-Witten-Yamazaki (CWY) theory for quantum integrability, we construct a novel topological 4D gravity given by Eq(5.1) with observables based on gravitational gauge field holonomies. The field action $S^{grav}_{4D}$ of this gravity has a gauge symmetry $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ and reads also as the difference $S^{CWY_{L}}_{4D}-S^{CWY_{R}}_{4D}$ with 4D Chern-Simons field actions $S^{CWY_{L/R}}_{4D}$ given by left/right CWY theory Eq(3.9). We also use this 4D gravity derivation to build observables describing gravitational topological defects and their interactions. We conclude our study with few comments regarding quantum integrability and the extension of AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ correspondence with regard to the obtained topological 4D gravity.</description>

      <title>Carroll limit of one-loop effective action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Carroll magnetic limit of a one-loop scalar effective action. We work on general static backgrounds and compute both divergent and finite parts of the effective action in this limit. We show, that the divergent part can be removed by adding local counterterms. The finite part is related to an effective action in a lower dimensional theory which however does not coincide in general with the one obtained by a Carroll limit in the classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds from momentum-space entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical theories have a limited regime of validity and hence must be accompanied by a breakdown diagnostic to establish when they cease to be valid as parameters are varied. For perturbative theories, estimates of the first neglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp bounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics, it is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such a diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime, where scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use the growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for perturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily used in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit. More in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density operator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an effective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it perturbatively. Constraints on the theory's regime of validity are then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.
  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial waves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences: purity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no partial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field theories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in inflationary models. Importantly, our bounds make no reference to time evolution and in de Sitter they depend exclusively on scale-invariant ratios of the physical kinematics.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Factorisation of the Hilbert Space for Two-Sided Black Holes in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hilbert space factorisation problem of two-sided black holes in high dimensions. We demonstrate that the Hilbert space of two-sided black holes can be factorized into the tensor product of two one-sided bulk Hilbert spaces when the effect of non-perturbative replica wormholes is taken into account. We further interpret the one-sided bulk Hilbert space as the Hilbert space of a one-sided black hole. Therefore, since the Hilbert space of a two-sided black hole can be obtained from the tensor product of two single-sided black hole Hilbert spaces, we consider this as an embodiment of the ER=EPR conjecture, and we show when the entanglement between the two single-sided black holes is sufficiently strong, the (Lorentzian) geometry of a two-sided black hole will emerge.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as a quantum frictional effect on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe. Consequently, this study validates the consistency of our method for constructing meaningful physical quantities in quantum inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

Abstract: Using a renormalization-inspired perturbation expansion we show that oscillons in a generic field theory in (1+1)-dimensions arise as dressed Q-balls of a universal (up to the leading nonlinear order) complex field theory. This theory reveals a close similarity to the integrable complex sine-Gordon model which possesses exact multi-$Q$-balls. We show that excited oscillons, with characteristic modulations of their amplitude, are two-oscillons bound states generated from a two $Q$-ball solution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries II. Coulomb Gas Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a suite of the most recent cosmological observations to test models of dynamical dark energy motivated by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on hilltop quintessence scenarios, able to satisfy theoretical constraints from quantum gravity. We discuss their realisation based on axions, their supersymmetric partners, and Higgs-like string constructions. We also examine a specific parameterisation for dynamical dark energy suitable for hilltop quintessence. We then perform an analysis based on Markov Chain Monte-Carlo to assess their predictions against CMB, galaxy surveys, and supernova data. We show to what extent current data can distinguish amongst different hilltop set-ups, providing model parameter constraints that are complementary to and synergetic with theoretical bounds from quantum gravity conjectures, as well as model comparisons across the main dark energy candidates in the literature. However, all these constraints are sensitive to priors based on theoretical assumptions about viable regions of parameter space. Consequently, we discuss theoretical challenges in refining these priors, with the aim of maximizing the informative power of current and forthcoming cosmological datasets for testing dark energy scenarios in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity Effects of Ultralight Boson Clouds Formed by Black Hole Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillating clouds of ultralight bosons can grow around spinning black holes through superradiance, extracting energy and angular momentum, and eventually dissipating through gravitational radiation. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA can thus probe the existence of ultralight bosons. In this study, we use fully general-relativistic solutions of the black hole-boson cloud systems to study the self-gravity effects of scalar and vector boson clouds, making only the simplifying assumption that the spacetime is axisymmetric (essentially corresponding to taking an oscillation average). We calculate the self-gravity shift in the cloud oscillation frequency, which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal, finding that this effect can be up to twice as large in the relativistic regime compared to non-relativistic estimates. We use this to improve the superrad waveform model, and estimate that this reduces the theoretical phase error to a few cycles over the characteristic timescale of the gravitational wave emission timescale for the louder vector boson signals. We also perform an analysis of the spacetime geometry of these systems, calculating how the cloud changes the innermost stable circular orbit and light-ring around the black hole.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled teleparallel scalar field reconstruction of matter bounce scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleparallel description of gravity theories where the gravity is mediated through the tetrad field and consequent torsion provide an alternative route to explain the late time cosmic speed up issue. Generalization of the teleparallel gravity theory with different functional forms of the torsion scalar $T$ leads to $f(T)$ gravity. The role of scalar field played in addressing issues in cosmology and astrophysics has developed an interest in the inclusion of a scalar field along with an interaction potential in the action. Such a generalized gravity theory is dubbed as $f(T,\phi)$ theory. We have explored such a gravity theory to reconstruct the interaction potential of the scalar field required for an extended matter bounce scenario. The cosmological implications of the reconstructed scalar field potential are studied considering two viable and well known functional forms of $f(T,\phi)$. The energy conditions of these model are discussed to assess the viability of the cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Flavor Patterns of Fundamental Particles from Quantum Entanglement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB Tensor Modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition in the post-inflationary universe can nearly mimic the characteristic shape and power of inflationary predictions across a range of observable angular scales. Although phase transitions arise from subhorizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on superhorizon scales. Thus, while B-mode power is suppressed on these large scales, it is not necessarily negligible. For viable phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude at multipole moments around the recombination peak can be comparable to nearly all single-field inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. This approximate degeneracy can be broken if a signal is measured at different angular scales, since the inflationary power spectrum is nearly scale invariant while the phase transition predicts a distinct suppression of power on large scales.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity theory perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We provide a quantum algorithm for computing the frame potential and show that 1. exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard, 2. for state vectors, it is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete to decide whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values, if the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits, and 3. both for state vectors and unitaries, it is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. As the frame potential is closely related to the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), our result implies that computing the OTOCs with exponential accuracy is also hard. Second, we address promise problems to decide whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design and show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this is the case even if a given set is promised to be either exponentially close to or worse than constant away from a $1$-design. Our results illustrate the computationally hard nature of unitary and state designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear response of a Schwarzschild black hole to an external quadrupolar perturbation is studied in analogy to a mechanical electrodynamical system, with the goal to describe the gravitational polarizability. Its causality properties imply dispersion relations that relate fluctuation and dissipative properties. We review and combine results obtained via the Regge-Wheeler equation on one side and a perturbative, worldline effective field theory description on the other, obtaining a consistent description of the dispersion relations for the gravitational polarizability of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the classical part of the 2-point correlation function of the black hole multipole depends on the boundary conditions of the space-time the black hole is immersed in, which is relevant for the dispersion relations considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric spacetime perturbations induced by a neutral scalar in the near-horizon region of extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. For the unperturbed black hole, the near-horizon region is given by another exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, namely the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Our aim is to extend this connection beyond the background level and identify perturbations of a Bertotti-Robinson spacetime as near-horizon perturbations of an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We explain that explicit identification of the perturbative solutions to the two different backgrounds can only work in appropriate gauges. For this reason, we first solve the two perturbation problems in the most general spherically symmetric gauges and then find the necessary gauge conditions for matching the Reissner-Nordstrom and Bertotti-Robinson perturbative solutions in the near-horizon limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the chiral transition for the quark condensate and the melting of scalar and vector mesons in two-flavor holographic QCD. This is done by extending the improved holographic soft wall models proposed in [1] to finite temperature, by means of introducing an asymptotically AdS black brane. We find that the chiral transition is second order in the chiral limit and a crossover for physical quark masses, as expected in two-flavor QCD. We investigate the melting of vector and scalar mesons in the deconfined plasma through the calculation of hadronic spectral functions. Fixing the model parameters by the meson spectrum at zero temperature, we find that the mesons melt at temperatures between $90$ and $110$ MeV and the chiral transition occurs around $129$ MeV. We also provide a prediction for the hydrodynamic diffusion constant associated with a flavor current in the deconfined plasma.</description>

      <title>Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$.
  We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.</description>

Abstract: Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5%$-$10% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We establish a universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory: new results from post-Newtonian and self-force theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the (displacement) gravitational wave memory due to a quasicircular inspiral of two black holes using a variety of perturbative techniques. Within post-Newtonian theory, we extend previous results for non-spinning binaries to 3.5PN order. Using the gravitational self-force approach, we compute the memory at first order in the mass ratio for inspirals into a Kerr black hole. We do this both numerically and via a double post-Newtonian--self-force expansion which we carry out to 5PN order. At second order in the self-force approach, near-zone calculations encounter an infrared divergence associated with memory, which is resolved through matching the near-zone solution to a post-Minkowskian expansion in the far zone. We describe that matching procedure for the first time and show how it introduces nonlocal-in-time memory effects into the two-body dynamics at second order in the mass ratio, as was also predicted by recent 5PN calculations within the effective field theory approach. We then compute the gravitational-wave memory through second order in the mass ratio (excluding certain possible memory distortion effects) and find that it agrees well with recent results from numerical relativity simulations for near-comparable-mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Progress on Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarise highlights from an ongoing research programme that aims, in the long run, at the ambitious goal of building a realistic, complete holographic composite-Higgs model. This contribution focuses on vacuum misalignment, by showing how to unify its description, as a phenomenon arising from weak coupling considerations, in the holographic description of a strongly coupled field theory in terms of a dual gravity theory. This is achieved by a non-trivial treatment of boundary-localised terms in the gravity action. The gravity backgrounds considered are completely regular and smooth. We provide numerical examples showing that the mass spectrum of particles in the four-dimensional theory is free of pathologies, and that a small hierarchy arises naturally, between the light states that, in this simplified set up, are analogous to the standard-model particles, and all the other, new composite states emerging in the strongly coupled theory.</description>

      <title>Integral quantization based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework of integral quantization applied to the motion of spinless particles in the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The proposed scheme is based on coherent states generated by the action of the Heisenberg-Weyl group and has been motivated by the Hamiltonian description of the geodesic motion in General Relativity. We believe that this formulation should also allow for a generalization to the motion of test particles in curved spacetimes. A key element in our construction is the use of suitably defined positive operator-valued measures. We show that this approach can be used to quantize the one-dimensional nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator, recovering the standard Hamiltonian as obtained by the canonical quantization. Our formalism is then applied to the Hamiltonian associated with the motion of a relativistic particle in the Minkowski spacetime. A direct application of our model, including a computation of transition amplitudes between states characterized by fixed positions and momenta, is postponed to a forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Divergent Energy-Momentum Fluxes In Nonlocal Gravity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the second order perturbations of the Deser-Woodard II (DWII), Vardanyan-Akrami-Amendola-Silvestri (VAAS) and Amendola-Burzilla-Nersisyan (ABN) nonlocal gravity models in an attempt to extract their associated gravitational wave energy-momentum fluxes. In Minkowski spacetime, the gravitational spatial momentum density is supposed to scale at most as $1/r^{2}$, in the $r \rightarrow \infty$ limit, where $r$ is the observer-source spatial distance. The DWII model has a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $1/r$; though this can be avoided when we set to zero the first derivative of its distortion function at the origin. Meanwhile, the ABN model also suffers from a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $r^{2}$. The momentum density from the VAAS model was computed on a cosmological background expressed in a Fermi-Normal-Coordinate system, and was found to scale as $r$. For generic parameters, therefore, none of these three Dark Energy models appear to yield well-defined gravitational wave energies, as a result of their nonlocal gravitational self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Measurement-invisible quantum correlations in scrambling dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Error Threshold of SYK Codes from Strong-to-Weak Parity Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are fundamentally linked to quantum phases of matter: the degenerate ground state manifold corresponds to the code space, while topological excitations represent error syndromes. Building on this concept, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, characterized by its extensive quasi-ground state degeneracy, serves as a constant rate approximate QEC code. In this work, we study the impacts of decoherence on the information-theoretic capacity of SYK models and their variants. Such a capacity is closely tied to traversable wormholes via its thermofield double state, which theoretically enables the teleportation of information across a black hole. We calculate the coherent information in the maximally entangled quasi-ground state space of the SYK models under the fermion parity breaking and parity conserving noise. Interestingly, we find that under the strong fermion parity symmetric noise, the mixed state undergoes the strong to weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of fermion parity, which also corresponds to the information-theoretic transition. Our results highlight the degradation of wormhole traversability in realistic quantum scenarios, as well as providing critical insights into the behavior of approximate constant-rate QEC codes under decoherence.</description>

      <title>Resurgence for the non-conformal Bjorken flow with Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider resurgence for the nonconformal Bjorken flow with Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics on the extended relaxation-time approximation. We firstly consider full formal transseries expanded around the equilibrium and then construct the resurgent relation by looking to the structure of Borel transformed ODEs. We form a conjecture of the resurgent relation based on the considerations that Stokes constants constituting of the resurgent relation originate only from singularities of dissipative variables on the Borel plane and that the other variables such as temperature and chemical potential become Borel nonsummable through nonlinear terms with the dissipative variables. We numerically check the conjecture for fundamental variables by explicitly evaluating values of the dominant Stokes constant depending on initial conditions and a particle mass. We also make comments on some issues related to transseries structure and resurgence such as the case of broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the massless case, generalized relaxation-time, and attractor solution.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Stable Envelopes for Certain Non-Symplectic Varieties and Dynamical $R$-Matrices for Superspin Chains from the Bethe/Gauge Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Aganagic-Okounkov's theory of elliptic stable envelopes, and its physical realization in Dedushenko-Nekrasov's and Bullimore-Zhang's works, to certain varieties without holomorphic symplectic structure or polarization. These classes of varieties include, in particular, classical Higgs branches of 3d $\mathcal N=2$ quiver gauge theories. The Bethe/gauge correspondence relates such a gauge theory to an anisotropic/elliptic superspin chain, and the stable envelopes compute the $R$-matrix that solves the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (dYBE) for this spin chain. As an illustrative example, we solve the dYBE for the elliptic $\mathfrak{sl}(1|1)$ spin chain with fundamental representations using the corresponding 3d $\mathcal N=2$ SQCD whose classical Higgs branch is the Lascoux resolution of a determinantal variety. Certain Janus partition functions of this theory on $I \times \mathbb E$ for an interval $I$ and an elliptic curve $\mathbb E$ compute the elliptic stable envelopes, and in turn the geometric elliptic $R$-matrix, of the anisotropic $\mathfrak{sl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Furthermore, we consider the 2d and 1d reductions of elliptic stable envelopes and the $R$-matrix. The reduction to 2d gives the K-theoretic stable envelopes and the trigonometric $R$-matrix, and a further reduction to 1d produces the cohomological stable envelopes and the rational $R$-matrix. The latter recovers Rim\'anyi-Rozansky's results that appeared recently in the mathematical literature.</description>

Abstract: We develop the thermal shadow formalism to study the conformal blocks decomposition in $D$-dimensional conformal field theory on $\mathbb{S}_{\beta}^{1} \times \mathbb{S}^{D-1}$, where the temperature is $T = \beta^{-1}$. It is demonstrated that both the 1-point thermal ($T\neq 0$) conformal blocks and the 4-point plane ($T=0$) conformal blocks are defined by the same 4-point conformal integral. It is shown that up to power prefactors the 1-point thermal conformal block is given by the fourth Appell function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider running coupling constant in holographic model with external magnetic field supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action. We obtain a significant dependence of the running coupling constant $\alpha$ on chemical potential, temperature and magnetic field. We use the boundary condition that ensures the agreement with lattice calculations of string tension between quarks at zero chemical potential. The location of the 1st order phase transitions in $(\mu, T)$-plane does not depend on the dilaton boundary conditions. We observe that running coupling $\alpha$ decreases with increasing magnetic field for the fixed values of chemical potential and temperature. At the 1st order phase transitions the functions $\alpha$ undergo jumps depending on temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We study the superconformal index of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories on $S^1\times_{\omega} S^2$ in the Cardy-like limit where the radius of the $S^1$ is much smaller than that of the $S^2$. We show that the first two leading terms in this Cardy-like expansion are dictated by the Bethe Ansatz formulation of the topologically twisted index of the same theory. We apply this relation to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic superconformal field theories describing the low-energy dynamics of $N$ M2-branes and derive closed form expressions, valid to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion, for the two leading terms in the Cardy-like expansion of the superconformal index. We also discuss the implications of our results for the entropy of supersymmetric Kerr-Newman black holes in AdS$_4$ and the four-derivative corrections to 4d gauged supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our proposal in arXiv:2405.06629, we present in detail the construction of the extended phase space for Yang-Mills at null infinity, containing the asymptotic symmetries and the charges responsible for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems at all orders. The generality of the procedure allows it to be directly applied to the computation of both tree and loop-level soft limits. We also give a detailed study of Yang-Mills equations under the radial expansion, giving a thorough construction of the radiative phase space for decays compatible with tree-level amplitudes for both light-cone and radial gauges. This gives rise to useful recursion relations at all orders between the field strength and the vector gauge coefficients. We construct the sub$^n$-leading charges recursively, and show a hierarchical truncation such that each charge subalgebra is closed, and their action in the extended phase space is canonical. We relate these results with the infinite-dimensional algebras that have been recently introduced in the context of conformal field theories at null infinity. We also apply our method to the computation of non-universal terms in the sub-leading charges arising in theories with higher derivative interaction terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make a general Killing spinor analysis of a particular $D=3, \, N=4$ gauged supergravity that comes from a consistent S$^3$ reduction of $D=6, \, N=(1,0)$ supergravity coupled to a single chiral tensor multiplet. We then focus on its supersymmetric solutions with a null Killing vector and find three new ones. Two of these, namely the null warped AdS$_3$ (also known as the Schr\"odinger spacetime) and the charged domain wall solutions, admit non-trivial gauge fields which give rise to rotating solutions in 6-dimensions. The uplift of the first one produces an interesting AdS$_3 \times$S$^3$ background with a non-trivial rotation in the $U(1)$ fiber direction of the S$^3$ which retains the Schr\"odinger scale invariance that the seed solution has. The second one leads to the well-known rotating dyonic string solution. Finally, the uplift of the third one, which is a domain wall solution with no gauge fields, results in a distribution of dyonic strings.</description>

In the present work, we begin with a systematic study of such corrections in the context scalar toy models whose perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction enjoys an intrinsic definition in terms of cosmological polytopes, focusing on one-loop graphs. Owing to the underlying twisted period integral representation they admit, their combinatorial structure along with their vector space structure, emerging from polynomial ideals algebra and intersection theory, are exploited to set-up and analyse the differential equations that the two- and three-site one-loop corrections have to satisfy upon variation of the external kinematic variables. We find that, while the two-site contribution can be written in terms of multiple-polylogarithms, this is no longer true for the three-site case, for which elliptic structures appear. As a non-trivial check, we consider the scattering amplitude limit, recovering the known result in terms of polylogarithms only.</description>

Abstract: Generating functions of BPS indices, counting states of D4-D2-D0 black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identified with rank 0 Donaldson- Thomas invariants, are examples of mock modular forms. They have a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three different types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their derivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which in turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <title>Strings and membranes from $\mathcal{A}$-theory five brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{A}$-theory takes U-duality symmetry as a guiding principle, with the SL(5) U-duality symmetry being described as the world-volume theory of a 5-brane. Furthermore, by unifying the 6-dimensional world-volume Lorentz symmetry with the SL(5) spacetime symmetry, it extends to SL(6) U-duality symmetry. The SL(5) spacetime vielbein fields and the 5-brane world-volume vielbein fields are mixed under the SL(6) U-duality transformation. We demonstrate that consistent sectionings of the SL(6) $\mathcal{A}$5-brane world-volume Lagrangian yield Lagrangians of the $\mathcal{T}$-string with O(D,D) T-duality symmetry, the conventional string, the ${\cal M}$5-brane with GL(4) duality symmetry, and the non-perturbative M2-brane in supergravity theory. The GL(4) covariant Lagrangian of the ${\cal M}$5-brane derived in this manner is a new, perturbatively quantizable theory.</description>

Abstract: Higher Forms Symmetries (HFS) of a closed bosonic M2-brane theory formulated from the world-volume perspective on a compactified target space $\mathcal{M}_9 \times T^2$ are obtained. We show that the cancellation of the 't Hooft anomaly present in the theory is related to a 3-form flux with 1-gerbe structure associated to the world-volume flux quantization condition. A Wilson surface is naturally defined on the topological operator that characterize the holonomy of the M2-brane. The projection of the flux quantization condition onto the spatial part of the worldvolume, leads to a flux quantization on the M2-brane. The topological operators realise discrete symmetries associated with the winding and the flux/monopole condition. The algebra of operators is well defined.</description>

      <title>Stringy K\"ahler moduli, mutation and monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.10891v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives the first description of derived monodromy on the stringy K\"ahler moduli space (SKMS) for a general irreducible flopping curve C in a 3-fold X with mild singularities. We do this by constructing two new infinite helices: the first consists of sheaves supported on C, and the second comprises vector bundles in a tubular neighbourhood. We prove that these helices determine the simples and projectives in iterated tilts of the category of perverse sheaves, and that all objects in the first helix induce a twist autoequivalence for X. We show that these new derived symmetries, along with established ones, induce the full monodromy on the SKMS.
  The helices have many further applications. We (1) prove representability of noncommutative deformations of all successive thickenings of a length l flopping curve, via tilting theory, (2) control the representing objects, characterise when they are not commutative, and their central quotients, and (3) give new and sharp theoretical lower bounds on Gopakumar-Vafa invariants for a curve of length l. When X is smooth and resolves an affine base, we furthermore (4) prove that the second helix classifies all tilting reflexive sheaves on X, and thus that (5) all noncommutative crepant resolutions arise from tilting bundles on X.</description>

Abstract: Regarding the proximity of dark energy scale and neutrino mass, one can get new insight into the probe signatures of vector field dark energy component on neutrino flavor conversion. A vector field is assumed to be conformally coupled to various matter components through a screening paradigm. We show how the oscillation probabilities evolve differently with a finite-size matter density like the Sun for different values of relevant model parameters. Considering existing neutrino flavor conversion data, we point out how this non-standard coupling affects neutrino fluxes and also we compute the discrepancy in the total flux of solar electron-neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders, which include SPT orders and symmetry breaking orders as special cases. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

      <title>Arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum cosmology and group field theory, predict the resolution of the initial cosmological singularity via a bounce: a regular spacetime region that connects the expanding branch of the universe to a contracting branch. The cosmological arrow of time, which by definition points in the direction of cosmic expansion, is reversed at the bounce. Nonetheless, it is still possible to discriminate between the two branches by considering different arrows, as defined for instance by the growth of perturbations. After reviewing general aspects of the time arrow problem in cosmology, we examine the properties of different arrows of time in bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the loop quantum cosmology bounce as a case study. These issues are examined in detail for an exact solution to the effective Friedmann equations of loop quantum cosmology with pressureless dust and a cosmological constant, which is a simplified version of the $\Lambda$CDM bounce scenario.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes generated by fast-roll mechanism in non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized non-canonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in the field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during a FR stage increases in comparison with a slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBH production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-\gamma}$. The spectral index $\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in the radiation-dominated (RD) era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales are illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analytical investigation of the bound and unbound motion of magnetized particles orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, which includes all conceivable types of bounded and unbounded orbits. In particular, for planetary orbits, we perform a comparative analysis of our findings with the observed position of the S2 star carrying magnetic dipole moment around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We found maximum and minimum values for the parameter of magnetic interaction between the magnetic dipole of the star and the external magnetic field, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the S2 star. As a result, we obtain estimations of the magnetic dipole of the star in order of $10^6 \rm \ G\cdot cm^{3}$. Additionally, we explore deflecting trajectories akin to gravitational Rutherford scattering. In obtaining the solutions for the orbital equations, we articulate the elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions, and our study is augmented by illustrative figures and simulations.</description>

      <title>Corrected Thermodynamics and Stability of Magnetic charged AdS Black Holes surrounded by Quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the corrected thermodynamics of non-linear magnetic charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes surrounded by quintessence, incorporating thermal fluctuations and deriving the corrected thermodynamic potentials. We analyze the effects of corrections due to thermal fluctuations on various thermodynamic potentials, including enthalpy, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy. Our results show significant impacts on smaller black holes, with first-order corrections destabilizing them, while second-order corrections enhance stability with increasing parameter values. The specific heat analysis further elucidates the stability criteria, indicating that the large black holes ensure stability against phase transitions. However, the thermal fluctuations do not affect the physical limitation points as well as the second-order phase transition points of the black hole. Our findings highlight the intricate role of thermal fluctuations in black hole thermodynamics and their influence on stability, providing deeper insights into the behaviour of black holes under corrected thermodynamic conditions.</description>

Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, making possible IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD Axions in light of String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to a quantum abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass. The issue of the gauge coupling unification is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Interacting hypersurfaces and multiple scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to construct ghost-free multiple scalar-tensor theories. The key idea is to use the geometric quantities of hypersurfaces defined by the scalar fields, rather than the covariant derivatives of scalar fields or spacetime curvature, to build the theory. This approach has proven effective in developing ghost-free scalar-tensor theories in the single-field case. When multiple scalar fields are present, each field specifies a foliation of spacelike hypersurfaces, on which we can define the normal vector, induced metric, extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures, as well as extrinsic (Lie) and intrinsic (spatial) derivatives, respectively. By employing these hypersurface geometric quantities as foundational elements, we construct the Lagrangian for interacting hypersurfaces that describes a multiple scalar-tensor theory. Given that temporal (Lie) and spatial derivatives are separated, it becomes relatively easier to control the order of time derivatives, thus helping to avoid ghost-like or unwanted degrees of freedom. In this work, we use bi-scalar-field theory as an example, focusing on polynomial-type Lagrangians. We construct monomials of hypersurface geometric quantities up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the number of derivatives in each monomial. Additionally, we present the correspondence between expressions in terms of hypersurface quantities and those in covariant bi-scalar-tensor theory. Through a cosmological perturbation analysis of a simple model, we demonstrate that the theory propagates two tensor and two scalar degrees of freedom at the linear order in perturbations, thereby remaining free from any extra degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Scalar one-loop tensor power spectrum during single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>

      <title>Charged superradiant instability in a spherical regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately $\text{Im} (M \omega) \sim 10^{-3}$. This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherically regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Scalar Mass against Loop Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the renormalized loop corrections to the scalar mass are suppressed if the field in the loop is heavy. Here, treating the renormalized mass is important, as it is the only observable. This means that the physics of a low-energy scalar field is insensitive to that of ultraviolet.</description>

      <title>Is the finite temperature effective potential, effective for dynamics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the applicability of the finite temperature effective potential in the equation of motion of a homogeneous "misaligned" scalar condensate $\varphi$, and find important caveats that severely restrict its domain of validity: i:) the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is in general not warranted, ii:) we show a direct relation between the effective potential and the thermodynamic entropy density $\mathcal{S}= - \partial V_{eff}(T,\varphi)/\partial T$, which entails that for a dynamical $\varphi(t)$ the entropy becomes a non-monotonic function of time, iii:) parametric instabilities in both cases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking lead to profuse particle production with non-thermal distribution functions, iv:) in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking spinodal instabilities yield a complex effective potential, internal energy and entropy, an untenable situation in thermodynamics. All these caveats associated with dynamical aspects, cannot be overcome by finite temperature equilibrium resummation schemes. We argue that the dynamics of the condensate leads to decoupling and freeze-out from (LTE), and propose a closed quantum system approach based on unitary time evolution. It yields the correct equations of motion without the caveats of the effective potential, and provides a fully renormalized and thermodynamically consistent framework to study the dynamics of the "misaligned" condensate, with real and conserved energy and entropy amenable to numerical study. The evolution of the condensate leads to profuse stimulated particle production with non-thermal distribution functions. Possible emergent asymptotic non-thermal states and eventual re-thermalization are conjectured.</description>
