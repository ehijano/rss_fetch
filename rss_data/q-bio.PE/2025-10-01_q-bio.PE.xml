      <title>Mathematical Framework for Epidemic Dynamics: Optimal Control and Global Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops and analyzes an extended Susceptible, Infected, Hospitalized and Recovered (SIHR) model incorporating time dependent control functions to capture preventive measures (e.g., distancing, mask use) and resource limited therapeutic interventions. This formulation provides a realistic mathematical framework for modeling public health responses beyond classical uncontrolled epidemic models. The control design is integrated into the model via an optimal control framework, solved numerically using the Forward Backward Sweep method, enabling the exploration of intervention strategies on epidemic dynamics, including infection prevalence, hospitalization burden, and the effective reproduction number. To assess the robustness of these strategies under uncertainty, we employ Polynomial Chaos Expansion combined with Sobol sensitivity indices, quantifying the influence of key epidemiological parameters (transmission, recovery, hospitalization rates) on model outcomes. Numerical simulations, calibrated to Djiboutian COVID 19 data, show that combined preventive and therapeutic interventions substantially mitigate epidemic burden, though their effectiveness depends critically on transmission related uncertainties. The originality of this work lies in combining optimal control theory with global sensitivity analysis, thus bridging numerical methods, optimization, and epidemic modeling. This integrated approach offers a general mathematical framework for designing and evaluating control strategies in infectious disease outbreaks, with applications to low resource settings and beyond.</description>

      <title>Continuum models describing probabilistic motion of tagged agents in exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice-based random walk models are widely used to study populations of migrating cells with motility bias and proliferation. Crowding is typically represented by volume exclusion, where each lattice site can be occupied by at most one agent and conflicting moves are aborted. This framework enables simulations that yield both population-level spatiotemporal agent density profiles and individual agent trajectories, comparable to experimental cell-tracking data. Previous continuum models for tagged-agent trajectories captured trajectory information only, and overlooked any measure of variability. This is an important limitation since trajectory data is inherently variable. To address this limitation, here we derive partial differential equations for the probability density function of tagged-agent trajectories. This continuum description has a clear physical interpretation, agrees well with distributional data from stochastic simulations, reveals the role of stochasticity in different contexts, and generalises to multiple subpopulations of distinct agents.</description>

      <title>What does the tree of life look like as it grows? Evolution and the multifractality of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By unifying three foundational principles of modern biology, we develop a mathematical framework to analyze the growing tree of life. Contrary to the static case, where the analogy between phylogenetic trees and the tree that grows in soil is drawn, our framework shows that the living tree of life is analogous to a Cantor dust where each branch is a distinct fractal curve. The system as a whole is therefore multifractal in the sense that it consists of many unique fractals. The three foundational principles for the mathematical framework are that phylogeny is nested, phylogeny is dualistic (i.e., transitive between singularities and populations), and phylogeny is stochastic. Integrating these three principles, we model the dynamic (i.e., living) tree of life as a random iterated function system that generates unique convexly related sequences of branching random variables (visualized in Animation 1). The multifractal nature of this dynamic tree of life implies that, for any two living entities, the time interval from their last common ancestor to the present moment is a distinct fractal curve for each. Thus, the length of a time interval along each distinct branch is unique, so that time is also multifractal and not an ultrametric on the tree of life.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations in SIS processes on regular random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In network-based SIS models of infectious disease transmission, infection can only occur between directly connected individuals. This constraint naturally gives rise to spatial correlations between the states of neighboring nodes, as the infection status of connected individuals becomes interdependent. Although mean-field approximations are commonly invoked to simplify disease forecasting on networks, they fail to account for these correlations by assuming that infectious individuals are well-mixed within a population, leading to inaccurate predictions of infection numbers over time. As such, the development of mathematical frameworks that account for spatially correlated infections is of great interest, as they offer a compromise between accurate disease forecasting and analytic tractability. Here, we use existing corrections to mean-field theory on the regular lattice to construct a more general framework for equivalent corrections on regular random graph topologies. We derive and simulate a system of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the spatial correlation function at various geodesic distances on random networks, and use solutions to this hierarchy of ordinary differential equations to predict the global infection density as a function of time, finding good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations. Our results constitute a substantial development on existing corrections to mean-field theory for infectious individuals in SIS processes and provide an in-depth characterization of how structural randomness in networks affects the dynamical trajectories of infectious diseases on networks.</description>

      <title>$K$-Branching Random Walk with Noisy Selection: Large Population Limits and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a variant of the Noisy $K$-Branching Random Walk, a population model that evolves according to the following procedure. At each time step, each individual produces a large number of offspring that inherit the fitness of their parents up to independent and identically distributed fluctuations. The next generation consists of a random sample of all the offspring so that the population size remains fixed, where the sampling is made according to a parameterized Gibbs measure of the fitness of the offspring. Our model interpolates between classical models of fitness waves and exhibits a novel phase transition in the propagation of the wave. By employing a stochastic Hopf-Cole transformation, we show that as we increase the population size, the random dynamics of the model can be described by deterministic operations acting on the limiting population densities. We then show that for fitness fluctuations with exponential tails, these operations admit a unique traveling wave solution with local stability. The traveling wave solution undergoes a phase transition when changing selection pressure, revealing a complex interaction between evolution and natural selection.</description>
