      <title>A new succinct proof on the equivalence of the Nernst equation and the vanishing heat capacity at absolute zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By starting from the Euler chain rule of three thermodynamic quantities, it is proved that both the Nernst equation and the vanishing heat capacity at absolute zero temperature are mutually deducible and equivalent. Simultaneously, it is pointed out that the conclusions of the relevant literature are worthy of discussion.</description>

      <title>Comment on the paper "Exact decay of the persistence probability in the Airy$_1$ process" by Ferrari and Liu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that the non-trivial function obtained by Ferrari and Liu for the persistence probability of the Airy$_1$ process has a strikingly similar form as a large deviation function found earlier by the author for current fluctuations of the totally asymmetric exclusion process with periodic boundaries conditioned on flat initial and final states. A proposed explanation for this observation, which relates similar yet clearly distinct quantities, is that both results pertain to conditioning on the same kind of rare events where a current larger than typical is maintained throughout the system.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling in time-crystalline matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the universal behavior linked to the Goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry in many-body systems, in which the order parameter traces out a limit cycle. We show that this universal behavior is closely tied to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang physics, which can strongly affect the scaling properties in all dimensions. Our work predicts the relevance of KPZ in numerous systems such as nonreciprocal phases in active matter, active magnets, driven-dissipative quantum systems, and synchronization of oscillators.</description>

      <title>Self Organized Critical Dynamic on the Sierpinski Carpet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organized criticality is a dynamical system property where, without external tuning, a system naturally evolves towards its critical state, characterized by scale-invariant patterns and power-law distributions. In this paper, we explored a self-organized critical dynamic on the Sierpinski carpet lattice, a scale-invariant structure whose dimension is defined as a power-law with a non-integer exponent, i.e. a fractal. To achieve this, we proposed an Ising-BCP (bond-correlated percolation) model as the foundation for investigating critical dynamics. Within this framework, we outlined a feedback mechanism for critical self-organization and followed an algorithm for its numerical implementation. The results obtained from the algorithm demonstrated enhanced efficiency when driving the Sierpinski carpet towards critical self-organization compared to a two-dimensional lattice. This efficiency was attributed to the iterative construction of the lattice and the distribution of spins within it. The key outcome of our findings is a novel dependence of self-organized criticality on topology for this particular model, which may have several applications in fields regarding information transmission.</description>

      <title>Optimizing power and efficiency of a single spin heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of a single spin in the presence of a time-varying magnetic field utilizing Glauber dynamics. We engineer the system to function as an engine by changing the magnetic field according to specific protocols. Subsequently, we analyze the engine's performance using various protocols and stochastic thermodynamics to compute average values of crucial quantities for quantifying engine performance. In the longtime limit of the engine cycle, we derive exact analytical expressions for work, heat, and efficiency in terms of a generalized protocol. We then analyze the model in terms of optimization of efficiency and power. Additionally, we use different protocols and employ a gradient descent algorithm to best fit those to obtain optimal efficiency and then optimal power for a finite cycle time. All the protocols converge to the piece-wise constant protocol during efficiency optimization. We then explore a more general approach using the variational principle to determine the optimal protocols for optimizing power and efficiency. During the optimization process for both power and efficiency, the net entropy production decreases, which enhances the engine's performance. This approach demonstrates the superior optimization of efficiency and power in this system compared to the gradient descent algorithm.</description>

      <title>Density-dependent stochastic resetting: a large deviations framework for achieving target distributions over networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for designing density-dependent stochastic resetting protocols to regulate distributions of random walkers on networks. Resetting mechanisms that depend on local densities induce correlations in otherwise non-interacting walkers. Our framework allows for the study of both transient trajectories and stationary properties and identifies resetting protocols that maximise the likelihood of homogeneous and, more generally, rare configurations of random walkers.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Response Relations for State Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for fluctuations. We further demonstrate their applicability for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov networks, use them to explain the physical origin of positive and negative correlations of occupation times in a double quantum dot device, and discuss their relevance for model inference.</description>

      <title>Separate length scale for coarsening and for fractal formation by persistent sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first example where length scale for the growth of ordered regions and the correlation length for the two point correlations of persistent sites scale differently with time. We do so by studying a global spin exchange dynamics in one dimension where a selected spin interacts with its two nearest domains. We found domain growth exponent $z=2.47\pm 0.03$ and the persistence exponent $\theta=0.445\pm0.002$, making $z\theta &gt; d=1$. Unlike any previous study, we found correlation length of two point correlation of persistent sites grows in a power law with exponent $\zeta=1.00\pm 0.03$ by studying the fractal structure created by the persistent sites at the different stages of the dynamics and shown that fractal dimension is not related with any growth exponents.</description>

      <title>Defects in the long-range O(N) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of extended excitations in the long-range O(N) model. We focus on line and surface defects and we discuss the challenges of a naive generalization of the simplest defects in the short-range model. To face these challenges we propose three alternative realizations of defects in the long-range model. The first consists in introducing an additional parameter in the perturbative RG flow or, equivalently, treating the non-locality of the model as a perturbation of the local four-dimensional theory. The second is based on the introduction of non-local defect degrees of freedom coupled to the bulk and it provides some non-trivial defect CFTs also in the case of a free bulk, i.e. for generalized free field theory. The third approach is based on a semiclassical construction of line defects. After finding a non-trivial classical field configuration we consider the fluctuation Lagrangian to obtain quantum corrections for the defect theory.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity for the planar limit of holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity is a fundamental characteristic of states within a quantum system. Its use is however mostly limited to bosonic systems, inhibiting its present applicability to supersymmetric theories. This is also relevant to its application to the AdS/CFT correspondence. To address this limitation, we extend the framework of spread complexity beyond bosonic systems to include fermionic and supercoherent states. This offers a gateway to compute spread complexity analytically for any semiclassical system governed by a Hamiltonian associated with a Lie (super)algebra. This requires extending the Krylov chain to a Krylov path in a higher-dimensional lattice. A detailed analysis of supercoherent states within the super Heisenberg-Weyl and OSp$(2|1)$ algebras elucidates distinct contributions from bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom to the complexity. This generalisation allows us to access the semiclassical regime of the planar limit of the holographic correspondence. We then compute the spread complexity of large charge superstring states on the gravity side, which are equivalent to the dual gauge states. The resulting complexity leads to Krylov paths capturing the geometry in which the string propagates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised classification of disordered phases in an oppositely charged colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify disordered phases in a system of oppositely charged colloids. In this system, the interplay between Coulomb and van der Waals interactions leads to transitions in local structures, while the global structure remains disordered. Our method involves representing the local structures of the system as high-dimensional vectors and applying principal component analysis to identify distinct features of each phase. We demonstrate that our method results in a reasonable classification of disordered phases, which is consistent with that obtained from radial distribution functions. The interpretability of the method reveals the key characteristics of each phase and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the unconventional phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling and magnetization temperature dependence in cubic ferromagnetic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in spintronics have drawn renewed attention to the spin dynamics of cubic ferromagnetic crystals EuO and EuS. These ferromagnets have the simplest possible magnetic structure, making them the most suitable systems for testing various theoretical models of magnetic materials. A commonly used Wess mean-field approximation (MFA) provides only a qualitative description of magnetization temperature dependence $M(T)$. We develop a consistent theory for $M(T)$, based on the perturbation diagrammatic technique for spin operators, leading to an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental dependence of $M(T)$ for EuO and EuS throughout the entire temperature range from $T=0$ to Curie temperature $T_{_{C}}$. In particular, our theoretical dependence $M(T)$ demonstrates an anomalous scaling behavior $ M(T)\propto (T_{_{C}}-T)^\beta$ with the scaling index $\beta\approx 1/3$ in a wide range of temperatures, in agreement with the experimentally observed scaling in EuO and EuS. This scaling index is principally different from the scaling index $\beta=1/2$ predicted by the MFA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of interfaces are key to understand the physics of matter. However, the study of quantum interface dynamics has remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we use large-scale Tree Tensor Network simulations to identify the dynamical signature of an interface roughening transition within the ferromagnetic phase of the 2D quantum Ising model. For initial domain wall profiles we find extended prethermal plateaus for smooth interfaces, whereas above the roughening transition the domain wall decays quickly. Our results can be readily explored experimentally in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and magic spreading under ergodic quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state complexity metrics, such as anticoncentration and magic, offer key insights into many-body physics, information scrambling, and quantum computing. Anticoncentration and equilibration of magic under dynamics of random quantum circuits occur at times scaling logarithmically with system size, a prediction that is believed to extend to more general ergodic dynamics. This work challenges this idea by examining the anticoncentration and magic spreading in one-dimensional ergodic Floquet models and Hamiltonian systems. Using participation and stabilizer entropies to probe these resources, we reveal significant differences between the two settings.Floquet systems align with random circuit predictions, exhibiting anticoncentration and saturation of magic at time scales that increase logarithmically with system size. In contrast, Hamiltonian dynamics deviate from the random circuit predictions and require times scaling approximately linearly with system size to achieve saturation of participation and stabilizer entropies, which remain smaller than that of the typical quantum states even in the long-time limit. Our findings establish the phenomenology of participation and entropy growth in ergodic many-body systems and emphasize the role of energy conservation in constraining anticoncentration and magic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on the percolation cluster: Waiting time distribution in side-branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the simplest model of transport of interacting particles in a disordered medium, we consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) in which particles with hard-core interactions perform biased random walks, on the supercritical percolation cluster. In this process, the long time trajectory of a marked particle consists of steps on the backbone, punctuated by time spent in side-branches. We study the probability distribution in the steady state of the waiting time $T_w$ of a randomly chosen particle, in a side-branch since its last step along the backbone. Exact numerical evaluation of this on a single side-branch of length $L=$ $1$ to $9$ shows that for large fields, the probability distribution of $\log T_w $ has multiple well separated peaks. We extend this result to a regular comb, and to the ASEP on the percolation cluster. We show that in the steady state, the fractional number of particles that have been in the same side-branch for a time interval greater than $T_w$ varies as $exp( - c \sqrt{\log T_w})$ for large $T_w$, where $c$ depends only on the bias field. However, these long timescales are not reflected in the eigenvalue spectrum of the Markov evolution matrix. The system shows dynamical heterogeneity, with particles segregating into pockets of high and low mobilities.</description>

      <title>Quasicondensation and off-diagonal long-range order of hard-core bosons during a free expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasicondensation in one dimension is known to occur for equilibrium systems of hard-core bosons (HCBs) at zero temperature. This phenomenon arises due to the off-diagonal long-range order in the ground state, characterized by a power-law decay of the one-particle density matrix $g_1(x,y)\sim |x-y|^{-1/2}$, a well-known outcome of Luttinger liquid theory. Remarkably, HCBs, when allowed to freely expand from an initial product state (i.e., characterized by initial zero correlation), exhibit quasicondensation and demonstrate the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order during nonequilibrium dynamics. This phenomenon has been substantiated by numerical and experimental investigations in the early 2000s. In this work, we revisit the dynamical quasicondensation of HCBs, providing a fully analytical treatment of the issue. In particular, we derive an exact asymptotic formula for the equal-time one-particle density matrix by borrowing ideas from the framework of quantum Generalized Hydrodynamics. Our findings elucidate the phenomenology of quasicondensation and of dynamical fermionization occurring at different stages of the time evolution, as well as the crossover between the two.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>

Abstract: The theory of causal emergence (CE) with effective information (EI) posits that complex systems can exhibit CE, where macro-dynamics show stronger causal effects than micro-dynamics. A key challenge of this theory is its dependence on coarse-graining method. {In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this. By applying singular value decomposition(SVD) to Markov dynamics, we find that the essence of CE lies in the presence of redundancy, represented by the irreversible and correlated information pathways. Therefore, CE can be quantified as the potential maximal efficiency increase for dynamical reversibility or information transmission. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the approximate dynamical reversibility and EI, establishing an equivalence between the SVD and EI maximization frameworks for quantifying CE, supported by theoretical insights and numerical examples from Boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks. Importantly, our SVD-based CE framework is independent of specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the fundamental characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parametrically long lifetime of superdiffusion in non-integrable spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superdiffusion is surprisingly easily observed even in systems without the integrability underpinning this phenomenon. Indeed, the classical Heisenberg chain -- one of the simplest many-body systems, and firmly believed to be non-integrable -- evinces a long-lived regime of anomalous, superdiffusive spin dynamics at finite temperature. Similarly, superdiffusion persists for long timescales, even at high temperature, for small perturbations around a related integrable model. Eventually, however, ordinary diffusion is believed to be asymptotically restored. We examine the timescales governing the lifetime of the superdiffusive regime, and argue that it diverges algebraically fast -- both in deviation from the integrable limit, and at low temperature, where we find $t^* \sim T^{-\zeta}$ with an exponent possibly as large as $\zeta = 8$. This can render the crossover to ordinary diffusion practically inaccessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium. However, this explanation lacks a rigorous description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations of a self-interacting diffusion on a ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the average speed or current of a self-interacting diffusion (SID) on a ring, mimicking the non-Markovian behaviour of an agent influenced by its own path. We derive the SID's phase diagram, showing a delocalisation-localisation phase transition from self-repelling to self-attracting. Current fluctuations are analysed using: (i) an adiabatic approximation, where the system reaches its stationary distribution before developing current fluctuations, and (ii) an original extension of level 2.5 large deviations for Markov processes combined with perturbation theory. Both methods provide lower bounds to current fluctuations, with the former tighter than the latter in all localised regimes, and both equally tight in the self-repelling region. Both methods accurately estimate the asymptotic variance and suggests a phase transition at the onset of the localised regime.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for Markovian systems based on coarse-grained observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most experiments can only detect a set of coarse-grained clusters of a molecular system, while the internal microstates are often inaccessible. Here, based on an infinitely long coarse-grained trajectory, we obtain a set of sufficient statistics which extracts all statistic information of coarse-grained observations. Based on these sufficient statistics, we set up a theoretical framework of parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for a general Markovian system with an arbitrary number of microstates and arbitrary coarse-grained partitioning. Our framework can identify whether the sufficient statistics are enough for empirical estimation of all unknown parameters and we can also provide a quantitative criterion that reveals nonequilibrium. Our nonequilibrium criterion generalizes the one obtained [J. Chem. Phys. 132:041102 (2010)] for a three-state system with two coarse-grained clusters, and is capable of detecting a larger nonequilibrium region compared to the classical criterion based on autocorrelation functions.</description>

      <title>Forces from coarse-graining nonequilibrium degrees of freedom: exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relaxation dynamics of a tracer in a harmonic trap coupled to a non-equilibrium bath particle in stationary state, finding qualitative differences compared to the well known equilibrium case. These can be attributed to an additional position and time dependent force acting on the tracer, emerging when averaging the bath degree in the non-equilibrium stationary state conditioned to a certain tracer position. Specifically, we provide analytical results for an overdamped tracer coupled linearly to a bath particle in different nonequilibrium scenarios, namely, subjected to a different temperature than the tracer, or to active noise with Gaussian or non-Gaussian fluctuations. For the case of different temperatures, the conditioned tracer-bath force can be as large in magnitude as the force from the trapping potential. For an active bath particle with memory, even the bath noise takes a finite average under conditioning of the tracer. Further, if the noise of the bath particle is non-Gaussian, the relaxation function of the tracer can be non-monotonic as a function of time. We also compute the \emph{pinned relaxation}, proposing that measurement and comparison of conditioned and pinned relaxation allows determination of the non-equilibrium forces in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an analytic approach for the steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on locally tree-like graphs. It is based on the definition of a probability distribution for infinite edge trajectories in terms of infinite matrix products. For homogeneous ensembles on regular graphs, the distribution is parametrized by a single $d\times d\times r^2$ tensor, where $r$ is the number of states per variable and $d$ is the matrix-product bond dimension. While the approach becomes exact in the large-$d$ limit, it usually produces extremely accurate results even for small $d$. The $d^2r^2$ parameters are found by solving a fixed point equation, for which we provide an efficient belief-propagation procedure. We apply it to a variety of models, including Ising-Glauber dynamics with symmetric and asymmetric couplings and the SIS model. Even for small $d$, the results are compatible with Monte Carlo estimates and accurately reproduce known exact solutions. The method gives access to accurate temporal correlations which, in some regimes, may be virtually impossible to estimate by sampling.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) and kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) provide tradeoff relations between measurement precision and thermodynamic cost such as entropy production and activity. Conventionally, these relations are derived using the Cram\'er-Rao inequality, which involves an auxiliary perturbation in deterministic differential equations governing the time evolution of the system's probability distribution. In this study, without relying on the previous formulation based on deterministic evolving equation, we demonstrate that all previously discovered uncertainty relations can be derived solely through the stochastic representation of the same dynamics. For this purpose, we propose a unified method based on stochastic representations for general Markovian dynamics. Extending beyond classical systems, we apply this method to Markovian open quantum systems by unraveling their dynamics, deriving quantum uncertainty relations that are physically more accessible and tighter in regimes where quantum effects play a significant role. This fully establishes uncertainty relations for both classical and quantum systems as intrinsic properties of their stochastic nature.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models: SU($N$) magnetic $\eta$ pairing, weak ergodicity breaking, and partial integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct exact eigenstates of multicomponent Hubbard models in arbitrary dimensions by generalizing the $\eta$-pairing mechanism. Our models include the SU($N$) Hubbard model as a special case. Unlike the conventional two-component case, the generalized $\eta$-pairing mechanism permits the construction of eigenstates that feature off-diagonal long-range order and magnetic long-range order. These states form fragmented fermionic condensates due to a simultaneous condensation of multicomponent $\eta$ pairs. While the $\eta$-pairing states in the SU(2) Hubbard model are based on the $\eta$-pairing symmetry, the exact eigenstates in the $N$-component system with $N\geq 3$ arise not from symmetry of the Hamiltonian but from a spectrum generating algebra defined in a Hilbert subspace. We exploit this fact to show that the generalized $\eta$-pairing eigenstates do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and serve as quantum many-body scar states. This result indicates a weak breakdown of ergodicity in the $N$-component Hubbard models for $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we show that these exact eigenstates constitute integrable subsectors in which the Hubbard Hamiltonian effectively reduces to a non-interacting model. This partial integrability causes various multicomponent Hubbard models to weakly break ergodicity. We propose a method of harnessing dissipation to distill the integrable part of the dynamics and elucidate a mechanism of non-thermalization caused by dissipation. This work establishes the coexistence of off-diagonal long-range order and SU($N$) magnetism in excited eigenstates of the multicomponent Hubbard models, which presents a possibility of novel out-of-equilibrium pairing states of multicomponent fermions. These models unveil a unique feature of quantum thermalization of multicomponent fermions, which can experimentally be tested with cold-atom quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: The jump unravelling of a quantum master equation decomposes the dynamics of an open quantum system into abrupt jumps, interspersed by periods of coherent dynamics when no jumps occur. Such open quantum systems are ubiquitous in quantum optics and mesoscopic physics, hence the need for efficient techniques for their stochastic simulation. Numerical simulation techniques fall into two main categories. The first splits the evolution into small timesteps and determines stochastically for each step if a jump occurs or not. The second, known as Monte Carlo Wavefunction simulation, is based on the reduction of the norm of an initially pure state in the conditional no-jump evolution. It exploits the fact that the purity of the state is preserved by the finest unraveling of the master equation. In this work, we present an alternative method for the simulation of the quantum jump unraveling, inspired by the classical Gillespie algorithm. The method is particularly well suited for situations in which a large number of trajectories is required for relatively small systems. It allows for non-purity-preserving dynamics, such as the ones generated by partial monitoring and channel merging. We describe the algorithm in detail and discuss relevant limiting cases. To illustrate it, we include four example applications of increasing physical complexity and discuss the performance of the algorithm across regimes of interest for open quantum systems simulation. Publicly available implementations of our code are provided in Julia and Mathematica.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystallization through vapor deposition is ubiquitous, and is inevitably influenced by impurities, which often impact the local structure. Interestingly, the effect of immobilizing some of the depositing particles themselves, which would still preserve local structural symmetry, remains largely unexplored. Herein, we perform colloidal vapor deposition on a substrate with a few pinned ad-colloids, termed "mobility impurities". Through thermodynamic and kinematic measurements, we demonstrate that these pinned ad-colloids, even though they share identical geometry and interaction with depositing particles, are disfavored as nucleation centers. We reveal that entropic contributions, rather than energetic ones, govern nucleation physics in the presence of mobility impurities. Moreover, tuning the mobility of colloids on the substrate adjusts the nucleation likelihood at pinned sites. In later stages of growth, pinning induces mode localization and alters the thin film's vibrational spectrum. Our work, thus, underscores the potential of strategically incorporating mobility impurities to engineer material properties.</description>

Abstract: The classical XY model has been consistently studied since it was introduced more than six decades ago. Of particular interest has been the two-dimensional spin model's exhibition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This topological phenomenon describes the transition from bound vortex-antivortex pairs at low temperatures to unpaired or isolated vortices and anti-vortices above some critical temperature. In this work we propose a novel machine learning based method to determine the emergence of this phase transition. An autoencoder was used to map states of the XY model into a lower dimensional latent space. Samples were taken from this latent space to determine the thermal average of the vortex density which was then used to determine the critical temperature of the phase transition.</description>
