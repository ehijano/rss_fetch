      <title>Navier-Stokes-driven analysis of mean and fluctuating wall shear stress in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Navier-Stokes-driven analysis of the mean and fluctuating wall shear stress (WSS) applied to turbulent channel flow data from direct numerical simulations at friction Reynolds numbers up to $Re_\tau\approx 2000$. Starting from the streamwise momentum equation, we derive exact integral equations that relate the square plane-average and the square fluctuating WSS to wall-normal integrals of terms combining shear with acceleration, shear with pressure-radient, and shear with viscous diffusion. The square plane-average WSS can be well approximated by the product of plane-average shear and plane-average acceleration integrated over the buffer layer with corrections from the mean pressure gradient which diminish as the reciprocal of the Reynolds number. The square fluctuating WSS is similarly well approximated by the shear-acceleration and shear-pressure-gradient covariances integrated over the buffer layer, but the latter increases in magnitude with Reynolds number and is therefore not negligible. The acceleration fluctuations around the plane-average acceleration consist of a local Eulerian fluctuating acceleration, an advective acceleration and a term which gives rise a turbulence production contribution to the shear-acceleration covariance. By Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis the Eulerian acceleration and the streamwise mean advection part of the advective acceleration cancel each other. The shear-acceleration covariance is characterised by a near-wall peak which results from turbulence production and, more specifically, sweeps.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Physics Informed Neural Network Solver for the Navier Stokes Equations Across Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics informed neural networks provide a meshfree framework for solving partial differential equations by embedding governing physical laws directly into the training process. However, most PINNs developed for fluid dynamics remain restricted to fixed flow parameters, requiring retraining for each new condition and limiting their usefulness as general purpose solvers. In this work, we develop a parameterized PINNs formulation for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in which the Reynolds number (Re) is treated as an explicit network input, enabling a single trained model to represent a continuous family of flow solutions. The approach is demonstrated using the 2D lid driven cavity flow as a canonical benchmark. For low Re, where the flow is laminar and diffusion dominated, pure PINNs trained solely using the governing equations and boundary conditions accurately reproduce velocity and pressure fields across a wide range of Re, including cases not explicitly sampled during training. As the Re increases and the flow becomes increasingly convection dominated, the predictive accuracy of pure PINNs deteriorates due to stiffness and optimization imbalance. To address this limitation, a hybrid framework is introduced that combines transfer learning with sparse supervision from high fidelity CFD data. The resulting parameterized PINNs model accurately captures the Re dependence of the flow over both interpolation and limited extrapolation regimes while requiring CFD data only over a narrow subset of the parameter space. Detailed comparisons with OpenFOAM simulations demonstrate strong agreement in velocity profiles, and pressure fields. The results show that incorporating governing parameters directly into PINNs enables the construction of parametric Navier Stokes solvers, offering a promising route toward efficient reduced order modeling and data assisted simulation of fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Turbulence teaches equivariance to neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the rotational nature of turbulence affects learned mappings between quantities governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. By varying the degree of anisotropy in a turbulence dataset, we explore how statistical symmetry affects these mappings. To do this, we train super-resolution models at different wall-normal locations in a channel flow, where anisotropy varies naturally, and test their generalization. By evaluating the learned mappings on new coordinate frames and new flow conditions, we find that coordinate-frame generalization is a key part of the generalization problem. Turbulent flows naturally present a wide range of local orientations, so respecting the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations improves generalization to new flows. Importantly, turbulence's rotational structure can embed these symmetries into learned mappings -- an effect that strengthens with isotropy and dataset size. This is because a more isotropic dataset samples a wider range of orientations, more fully covering the rotational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. The dependence on isotropy means equivariance error is also scale-dependent, consistent with Kolmogorov's hypothesis. Therefore, turbulence provides its own data augmentation (we term this implicit data augmentation). We expect this effect to apply broadly to learned mappings between tensorial flow quantities, making it relevant to most machine learning applications in turbulence.</description>

      <title>Topology- and Geometry-Exact Coupling for Incompressible Fluids and Thin Deformables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a topology-preserving discretization for coupling incompressible fluids with thin deformable structures, achieving guaranteed leakproofness through preservation of fluid domain connectivity. Our approach leverages a stitching algorithm applied to a clipped Voronoi diagram generated from Lagrangian fluid particles, in order to maintain path connectivity around obstacles. This geometric discretization naturally conforms to arbitrarily thin structures, enabling boundary conditions to be enforced exactly at fluid-solid interfaces. By discretizing the pressure projection equations on this conforming mesh, we can enforce velocity boundary conditions at the interface for the fluid while applying pressure forces directly on the solid boundary, enabling sharp two-way coupling between phases. The resulting method prevents fluid leakage through solids while permitting flow wherever a continuous path exists through the fluid domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on diverse scenarios including flows around thin membranes, complex geometries with narrow passages, and deformable structures immersed in liquid, showcasing robust two-way coupling without artificial sealing or leakage artifacts.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Saturation of the Acoustic Resonant Drag Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant drag instabilities (RDIs) are a novel type of dust/fluid instability relevant to a diverse range of astrophysical environments. They are driven by a resonant interaction between streaming dust and waves in a background medium, which results in dust density fluctuations and amplification of the waves. This broad class of instabilities includes recently-proposed modes incorporating acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, as well as the well-studied disk streaming instability. As the study of RDIs is at an early stage, their evolution beyond the linear regime is not well understood. In order to make inroads into the nonlinear theory of RDIs, we performed simulations of the simplest case, the acoustic RDI, in which sound waves in a gas are amplified by interaction with supersonically streaming dust. This particular instability is of interest both due its potential relevance in various poorly ionized environments, and due to its resemblance to the fast magnetosonic RDI. We find that the nonlinear growth and saturation of the instability are characterized by a balance between time scales of instability growth and turbulent eddy turnover. The simulations demonstrate a saturated state possessing an anisotropic outer forcing range in which this balance is maintained, and suggest the presence of an isotropic turbulent inertial range below this scale. By presenting a model for the nonlinear growth and saturated state of the acoustic RDI, this work provides a framework for further study of the nonlinear behavior of this and other RDIs.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Structure of the Advection--Diffusion Spectrum in Mixed Phase Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the spectral structure of the two-dimensional advection-diffusion operator in flows with mixed phase space at very large Peclet number. Using Fourier discretization combined with symmetry reduction and Krylov-Arnoldi methods, we compute on the order of one hundred leading eigenpairs reliably in the asymptotic, weak-diffusion regime. While the principal eigenvalue is asymptotically diffusive and localized on the largest regular region, the broader spectrum exhibits a rich organization controlled by local Lagrangian phase-space geometry. In particular, exponential mixing in chaotic regions rapidly suppresses correlations, whereas algebraic mixing in integrable regions generates long-lived coherent structures that dominate the slow and intermediate parts of the spectrum. We identify three distinct classes of eigenmodes: advective modes associated with transport on invariant tori, diffusive modes and, within the duffusive branch, tunneling modes arising from weak coupling between dynamically separated regular regions. Drawing on a semiclassical analogy, we assign quantum-number-like labels to these families and predict the appearance, scaling, and ordering of their sub-spectra directly from the Hamiltonian phase-space structure. The coexistence of these families implies that no uniform control of the spectral gap exists across the full spectrum: although the slowest mode is diffusive, arbitrarily small gaps arise between competing families at higher mode numbers. As a result, finite-time advection-diffusion dynamics is generically governed by persistent modal competition rather than single-mode dominance, even at asymptotically large Peclet number.</description>

      <title>Coupled Integral PINN for Discontinuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) solve forward PDEs by minimizing residual losses from the governing equations with initial and boundary conditions, but they often struggle with discontinuities such as shocks. In contrast, finite volume methods (FVM) handle discontinuities by enforcing integral conservation, which admits weak solutions. Motivated by this, we propose a Coupled Integral PINN (CI-PINN) that augments a standard PINN with an auxiliary network for integral potentials and coupled integral constraints. This improves robustness near shocks while avoiding meshing and the numerical flux integration/reconstruction used in classical schemes. We validate CI-PINN on forward benchmarks including Burgers, Buckley--Leverett, the Euler system, and the Shallow-Water equations.</description>

      <title>Spatial dynamics of flexible nano-swimmers under a rotating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-nano-robotic swimmers have promising potential for future biomedical tasks such as targeted drug delivery and minimally-invasive diagnosis. An efficient method for controlled actuation of such nano-swimmers is applying a rotating external magnetic field, resulting in helical corkscrew-like locomotion. In previous joint work, we presented fabrication and actuation of a simple magnetic nano-swimmer composed of two nano-rods connected by a short elastic hinge. Experiments under different actuation frequencies result in different motion regimes. At low frequencies, in-plane tumbling; at higher frequencies, moving forward in a spatial helical path in synchrony with the rotating magnetic field; in further frequency increase, asynchronous swimming is obtained. In this work, we present mathematical analysis of this nano-swimmer motion. We consider a simple two-link model and explicitly formulate and analyze its nonlinear dynamic equations, and reduce them to a simpler time-invariant system. For the first time, we obtain explicit analytic solutions of synchronous motion under simplifying assumptions, for both solutions of in-plane tumbling and spatial helical swimming. We conduct stability analysis of the solutions, presenting stability transitions and bifurcations for the different solution branches. Furthermore, we present analysis of the influence of additional effects, as well as parametric optimization of the swimmer's speed. The results of our theoretical study are essential for understanding the nonlinear dynamics of experimental magnetic nano-swimmers for biomedical applications, and conducting practical optimization of their performance.</description>

      <title>Advection selects pattern in multistable emulsions of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (1) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (2) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (3) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</description>
