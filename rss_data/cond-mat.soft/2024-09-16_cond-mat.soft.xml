      <title>Segregation, Finite Time Elastic Singularities and Coarsening in Renewable Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material renewability in active living systems, such as in cells and tissues, can drive the large-scale patterning of forces, with distinctive phenotypic consequences. This is especially significant in the cell cytoskeleton, where multiple species of myosin bound to actin, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual turnover, that result in patterned force channeling. Here we study the dynamical patterning of stresses that emerge in a hydrodynamic model of a renewable active actomyosin elastomer comprising two myosin species. We find that a uniform active contractile elastomer spontaneously segregates into spinodal stress patterns, followed by a finite-time collapse into tension carrying singular structures that display self-similar scaling and caustics. These singular structures move and merge, and gradually result in a slow coarsening dynamics in one dimension. In addition, the nonreciprocal nature of the underlying dynamics gives rise to exceptional points that are associated with a variety of travelling states -- from peristalsis to swap and trains of regular and singular stress patterns, that may coexist with each other. Both the novel segregation and excitability are consequences of time reversal symmetry breaking of the underlying active dynamics. We discuss the implications of our findings to the emergence of stress fibers and the spatial patterning of myosin.</description>

      <title>Polydisperse polymer fractionation between phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer mixtures fractionate between phases depending on their molecular weight. Consequently, by varying solvent conditions, a polydisperse polymer sample can be separated between phases so as to achieve a particular molecular weight distribution in each phase. In principle, predictive physics-based theories can help guide separation design and interpret experimental fractionation measurements. Even so, applying the standard Flory-Huggins model can present a computational challenge for mixtures with many polymeric components of different length, particularly for scarce components at the tails of a distribution. Here, we apply our recently-derived exact analytical solution of multi-component Flory-Huggins theory for polydisperse polymers to understand the principles of polymer fractionation for common molecular weight distributions. Our method reveals that polymer fractionation is highly sensitive to the shape, and in particular the tails, of this distribution. Our results highlight the need for considering the full molecular weight distribution in phase coexistence calculations.</description>

      <title>One-way catalysis: Insights from a solvable lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalysts speed up chemical reactions with no energy input and without being transformed in the process, therefore leaving equilibrium constants unchanged. Some catalysts, however, are much more efficient at accelerating one direction of a reaction. How is such an asymmetry consistent with chemical equilibrium, where as many forward and reverse reactions must occur? We use the rigorous framework of a simple but exactly solvable lattice model to study this question in the context of a strictly one-way catalyst, which can only accelerate one way of a reaction. The model illustrates a mathematical relationship between asymmetric transition rates, which underlie directional catalysis, and symmetric transition fluxes, which underlie chemical equilibrium. The degree of directionality generally depends on the catalytic mechanism and we compare different mechanisms to show how they can obey different scaling laws. The results showcase the ability of simple physical models to address fundamental questions in catalysis.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Filaments Recycled from Fishing Gear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic pollution, mainly from lost fishing gear composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), poses a significant environmental obstacle. This study evaluates the potential of recycling PP from fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fiber (GF) in the form of 3D printer filaments as a way to reduce/prevent ocean plastic. Two materials, one virgin (vPP-GF) and one made up of recycled polypropylene and virgin glass fibers (rPP-GF), were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry, tensile, and Charpy impact tests. From the results, it was found that rPP-GF often outperformed vPP-GF. rPP-GF had a higher melting and crystallization point, likely a higher crystallinity, and could withstand a higher tensile stress, while vPP-GF could withstand a higher tensile strain. Further analysis revealed the potential presence of HDPE within the rPP-GF composite, which was not reported by the manufacturer. This significantly affected the Charpy test and made it difficult to draw conclusions from the resulting data. Nevertheless, their comparability in terms of mechanical and material properties indicates the strong potential of recycling polypropylene fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fibers to extend their lifespan and reduce ocean plastic.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in Semidilute Polyelectrolyte Solutions and Complex Coacervates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that hydrodynamics in dense polyelectrolyte (PE) solutions, such as semidilute PE solutions and PE complex coacervates, is heavily screened and inconsequential. Here, using mesoscale molecular dynamics that explicitly accounts for hydrodynamics, we show that segmental dynamics in the subdiffusive regime show strong signatures of hydrodynamic interactions that persist well beyond the correlation length of semidilute PE solutions with moderately short chains. The strong hydrodynamic effects are also observed in coacervate systems containing moderately short chains, even with PE concentration as high as $30\%$. Our work fills a gap in the existing simulation literature on dense PE solutions and hints at the importance of hydrodynamics in the transport and rheological properties in broader polymer/polyelectrolyte solution systems.</description>

      <title>Liquid crystal torons in Poiseuille-like flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) simulations of the structure of liquid crystal (LC) torons, topologically protected distortions of the LC director field, under material flows are rare but essential in microfluidic applications. Here, we show that torons adopt a steady-state configuration at low flow velocity before disintegrating at higher velocities, in line with experimental results. Furthermore, we show that under partial slip conditions at the boundaries, the flow induces a reversible elongation of the torons, also consistent with the experimental observations. These results are in contrast with previous simulation results for 2D skyrmions under similar flow conditions, highlighting the need for a 3D description of this LC soliton in relation to its coupling to the material flow. These findings pave the way for future studies of other topological solitons, like hopfions and heliknotons, in flowing soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Extrapolative ML Models for Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models have been progressively used for predicting materials properties. These models can be built using pre-existing data and are useful for rapidly screening the physicochemical space of a material, which is astronomically large. However, ML models are inherently interpolative, and their efficacy for searching candidates outside a material's known range of property is unresolved. Moreover, the performance of an ML model is intricately connected to its learning strategy and the volume of training data. Here, we determine the relationship between the extrapolation ability of an ML model, the size and range of its training dataset, and its learning approach. We focus on a canonical problem of predicting the properties of a copolymer as a function of the sequence of its monomers. Tree search algorithms, which learn the similarity between polymer structures, are found to be inefficient for extrapolation. Conversely, the extrapolation capability of neural networks and XGBoost models, which attempt to learn the underlying functional correlation between the structure and property of polymers, show strong correlations with the volume and range of training data. These findings have important implications on ML-based new material development.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric nematic phase in the system of perfectly aligned cyllindrically symmetric rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental discovery of ferroelectric and splay nematic phases has sparked interest in comprehending the crucial molecular features necessary to stabilize these innovative structures. This study advances the ongoing discourse by investigating the significance of both molecular elongation and the distribution of molecular dipoles along the main molecular axis. Using Density Functional Theory, we have established that a molecular shape characterized by cylindrical symmetry and the presence of strong parallel dipoles along the symmetry axis can lead to the self-assembly of a ferroelectric nematic, which is more stable than the conventional uniaxial nematic phase. Additionally, we provide criteria for achieving an optimal dipole distribution along the molecular axis.</description>

      <title>Understanding Polymer-Colloid Gels: A Solvent Perspective Using Low-Field NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work emphasizes the relevance of low-field NMR relaxometry to investigate colloid-polymer hydrogels by probing water dynamics across a wide range of formulations between $\rm 10^{\circ}C$ and $\rm 80^{\circ}C$. By examining the temperature dependence of the transverse relaxation time $T_2$, we demonstrate a clear link between the NMR response and the rheological behavior of the hydrogels. In particular, we show that NMR relaxometry targeting the solvent provides reliable insights into the hydrogel microstructure and allows the detection of phase transitions and aging processes. Our findings suggest that this solvent-focused technique could greatly benefit the soft matter community, complementing other experimental methods in the study of gels.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the question of what instantaneous normal modes tell us about liquid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration and the inevitable frequent atomic rearrangements have long obstructed the achievement of a complete atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties, a challenge that continues to be unresolved. The instantaneous normal mode (INM) approach, based on the diagonalization of the potential energy Hessian matrix in instantaneous liquid configurations, has been shown to be a promising starting point to predict thermodynamic and dynamical properties of liquids but presents several conceptual difficulties that remain to be addressed. More in general, due to the inability of capturing anharmonic effects, what INMs can tell us about liquid dynamics remains an open question. In this work, we provide a general set of ``experimental facts'' by performing a comprehensive INM analysis of several simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N$_2$, CS$_2$, Ga and Pb, in a large range of temperatures from the solid to the gas phase. We first study the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the density of state function obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. Secondly, we analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and of the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS, in search of possible universal behaviors. We then explore the connection between INMs and other properties of liquids including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. Moreover, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperature upon approaching the solid phase, revealing the existence of a large fraction of unstable modes also in crystalline solids. Finally, we verify the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and reveal its complex behavior upon dialing temperature that challenges the existing theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-RNA with parallel aligned single-strands and periodic base sequence as a new universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a field theory for RNA-like polymers with periodic base sequence GCGCG..., where only single-strands aligned in the same direction form double strands. The field theory is derived from a lattice model that incorporates excluded volume effects, base sequence, and temperature dependent renaturation/denaturation.
  The artificial directionality leads to a novel universality class, not related to conventional branched polymers and Lee-Yang field theory. This universality class is unstable against natural pairing, where oppositely aligned single-strands form double strands. The denaturation/renaturation transition is a continuous crossover between two $\varphi_{n=0}^{4}$ critical points and the critical point of the new universality class.</description>

      <title>Efficient transport controlled by biharmonic frictional driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dry friction has been proposed as a rectifying mechanism allowing mass transport over a vibrating surface, even when vibrations are horizontal and unbiased. It has been suggested that the drift velocity will always saturate when the energy of the input oscillation increases, leading to a vanishing efficiency that would hinder the applicability of this phenomenon. Contrary to this conjecture, in this work we experimentally demonstrate that, by carefully controlling the forcing oscillations, this system can maintain a finite transport efficiency for any input energy. A minimal friction model explains the observed dependencies of the drift velocity on the signal parameters in the case of biharmonic base oscillations, which can be extended to obtain efficiency estimates for any periodic excitation.</description>

      <title>Role of kinematic constraints in the time reversal symmetry breaking of a model active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active-matter systems are inherently out-of-equilibrium and perform mechanical work by utilizing their internal energy sources. Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) is a hallmark of such dissipative non-equilibrium dynamics. We introduce a robust, experimentally accessible, noninvasive, quantitative measure of BTRS in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in collision events, demonstrated in our novel artificial active matter, comprised of battery-powered spherical rolling robots whose energetics in different modes of motion can be measured with high precision. Our dimensionless measure characterizes how dissipation and internal energetics are influenced by kinematic constraints from interactions with the environment. We propose this measure of BTRS as an empirical estimate of the distance from equilibrium. An energetic insight into this departure of active matter from equilibrium comes from our demonstration of a non-trivial fluctuation symmetry, which reveals a potentially universal thermodynamic characteristic of active energetics. As a many-body consequence of BTRS in our experimental active system, we demonstrate the emergence of activity-induced herding, which has no equilibrium analogue.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geometric Control of Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active matter represents a class of non-equilibrium systems that constantly dissipate energy to produce directed motion. The thermodynamic control of active matter holds great potential for advancements in synthetic molecular motors, targeted drug delivery, and adaptive smart materials. However, the inherently non-equilibrium nature of active matter poses a significant challenge in achieving optimal control with minimal energy cost. In this work, we extend the concept of thermodynamic geometry, traditionally applied to passive systems, to active matter, proposing a systematic geometric framework for minimizing energy cost in non-equilibrium driving processes. We derive a cost metric that defines a Riemannian manifold for control parameters, enabling the use of powerful geometric tools to determine optimal control protocols. The geometric perspective reveals that, unlike in passive systems, minimizing energy cost in active systems involves a trade-off between intrinsic and external dissipation, leading to an optimal transportation speed that coincides with the self-propulsion speed of active matter. This insight enriches the broader concept of thermodynamic geometry. We demonstrate the application of this approach by optimizing the performance of an active monothermal engine within this geometric framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A point force acting on a Brinkman fluid in confinement is always counterbalanced by the force on the porous medium, the force on the walls and the stress at open boundaries. We discuss the distribution of those forces in different geometries: a long pipe, a medium with a single no-slip planar boundary, a porous sphere with an open boundary and a porous sphere with a no-slip wall. We determine the forces using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and additionally validate the results with explicit analytical flow solutions. We discuss the relevance of our findings for cellular processes such as cytoplasmic streaming and centrosome positioning.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning in meiosis II oocytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the persistent flow of fluid inside a cell, induces intracellular transport, which plays a key role in fundamental biological processes. In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours. However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new, hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap. We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian meiosis.</description>

Abstract: Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past work shows a 'hovering' state where they swim stably at a finite height above surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering. Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two essential asymmetries: the response of width-asymmetric cells to active flows created by length-asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and far-field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.</description>

      <title>Stiffer alginate gels deposit more efficiently in microchannel flows</title>

Abstract: The behavior of crosslinking polymer solutions as they transition from liquid-like to solid-like material in flow determines success or failure in several applications, from 3D printing to oil recovery in the earth's subsurface, to a wide variety of biological flows. Dilute polymer solutions flow easily, while concentrated polymers or crosslinked polymer gels can clog pores, nozzles, or channels. We have recently uncovered and described a third regime of flow dynamics in polymers that occurs when crosslinking happens during flow: persistent intermittency. When a dilute alginate solution meets calcium at a Y-shaped microfluidic junction, a persistent and regular pattern of gel deposition and ablation emerges when driven at a constant volumetric flow rate. Chemical concentrations and flow rate control both the deposition process and critical shear stress required to ablate the adhered gel. In this work, we provide an analytical framework to quantitatively describe the intermittent behavior as resulting from diffusively driven deposition in a high Peclet number flow, where convection dominates. Fitting the experimental data to the model allows estimation of the deposition efficiency and \textit{in situ} swelling ratios. Ablation occurs when applied shear stresses overcome either the adhesive energy of the gel or its yield stress. By correlating the results of the analytical analysis with bulk rheology measurements, we find that deposition efficiency increases with the stiffness of the gel formed in flow. Softer gels withstand higher shear stresses before ablation. Both deposition efficiency and gel stiffness increase in flow conditions nearing complete clogging.</description>

Abstract: We discover an instability mechanism in suspensions of self-propelled particles that does not involve active stress. Instead, it is driven by a subtle interplay of inertia, swimmer motility, and concentration fluctuations, through a crucial time lag between the velocity and the concentration field. The resulting time-persistent state seen in our high-resolution numerical simulations consists of self-sustained waves of concentration and orientation, transiting from regular oscillations to wave turbulence. We analyze the statistical features of this active turbulence, including an intriguing connection to the Batchelor spectrum of passive scalars.</description>

      <title>Polymer Concentration Regimes from Fractional Microrheology</title>

Abstract: In this work, a framework for deriving theoretical equations for mean squared displacement (MSD) and fractional Fokker-Planck (FFP) is developed for any arbitrary rheological model. The obtained general results are then specified for different fractional rheological models. To test the novel equations extracted from our framework and bridge the gap between microrheology and fractional rheological models, microrheology of polystyrene (PS) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions at several polymer concentrations is measured. By comparing the experimental and theoretical MSDs, we find the fractional rheological parameters and demonstrate for the first time that the polymer concentration regimes can be distinguished using the fractional exponent and relaxation time data because of the existence of a distinct behavior in each regime. We suggest simple approximations for the critical overlap concentration and the shear viscosity of viscoelastic liquid-like solutions. This work provides a more sensitive approach for distinguishing different polymer concentration regimes and measuring the critical overlap concentration and shear viscosity of polymeric solutions, which is useful when conventional rheological characterization methods are unreliable due to the volatility and low viscosity of the samples.</description>

      <title>Dispersionless Flat Mode and Vibrational Anomaly in Active Brownian Vibrators Induced by String-like Dynamical Defects</title>

Abstract: In recent years, active Brownian particles have emerged as a prominent model system for comprehending the behaviors of active matter, wherein particles demonstrate self-propelled motion by harnessing energy from the surrounding environment. A fundamental objective of studying active matter is to elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying its collective behaviors. Drawing inspiration from advancements in molecular glasses, our study unveils a low-energy ``flat mode" within the transverse spectrum of active Brownian vibrators -- a nearly two-dimensional, bi-disperse granular assembly. We demonstrate that this collective excitation induces an anomalous excess in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) beyond the phononic Debye contribution. We characterize the properties of this flat mode by exploring the parameter space of our experimental system and tuning the packing fraction, the vibrational frequency, the particle size ratio and the mixture ratio. Additionally, we establish through empirical evidence that string-like dynamical defects, discerned via the spatial distribution of each particle's contribution to the reduced transverse VDOS, serve as the microscopic origin of the flat mode and its associated anomalies.</description>

      <title>Forces from coarse-graining nonequilibrium degrees of freedom: exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study paradigmatic examples of a tracer trapped in a harmonic potential and coupled to a bath particle of various types. Restricting to linear couplings between tracer and bath allows for analytical treatment. We discuss the resulting stochastic Langevin equation for the tracer and its relaxation function, for which this equation is averaged under an initial tracer position. For equilibrium, the tracer-bath force on average vanishes, a well known consequence of Boltzmann statistics. If tracer and bath are subject to different temperatures, the conditioned tracer-bath force is finite, and can be as large in magnitude as the force between tracer and trapping potential. For a bath particle with intrinsic memory, e.g., an active particle, even the noise felt by the bath particle takes a finite average under conditioning of the tracer. If the noise of the bath particle is non-Gaussian, the relaxation function of the tracer can be non-monotonic as a function of time. We display how these phenomena are reflected in the Langevin equation of the tracer.</description>
