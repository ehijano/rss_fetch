      <title>Boolean Circuit Complexity and Two-Dimensional Cover Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reduce the problem of proving deterministic and nondeterministic Boolean circuit size lower bounds to the analysis of certain two-dimensional combinatorial cover problems. This is obtained by combining results of Razborov (1989), Karchmer (1993), and Wigderson (1993) in the context of the fusion method for circuit lower bounds with the graph complexity framework of Pudl\'ak, R\"odl, and Savick\'y (1988). For convenience, we formalize these ideas in the more general setting of "discrete complexity", i.e., the natural set-theoretic formulation of circuit complexity, variants of communication complexity, graph complexity, and other measures.
  We show that random graphs have linear graph cover complexity, and that explicit super-logarithmic graph cover complexity lower bounds would have significant consequences in circuit complexity. We then use discrete complexity, the fusion method, and a result of Karchmer and Wigderson (1993) to introduce nondeterministic graph complexity. This allows us to establish a connection between graph complexity and nondeterministic circuit complexity.
  Finally, complementing these results, we describe an exact characterization of the power of the fusion method in discrete complexity. This is obtained via an adaptation of a result of Nakayama and Maruoka (1995) that connects the fusion method to the complexity of "cyclic" Boolean circuits, which generalize the computation of a circuit by allowing cycles in its specification.</description>

      <title>Color-Constrained Arborescences in Edge-Colored Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multigraph $G$ whose edges are colored from the set $[q]:=\{1,2,\ldots,q\}$ (\emph{$q$-colored graph}), and a vector $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{q}) \in \mathbb{N}^{q}$ (\emph{color-constraint}), a subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called \emph{$\alpha$-colored}, if $H$ has exactly $\alpha_i$ edges of color $i$ for each $i \in[q]$. In this paper, we focus on $\alpha$-colored arborescences (spanning out-trees) in $q$-colored multidigraphs. We study the decision, counting and search versions of this problem. It is known that the decision and search problems are polynomial-time solvable when $q=2$ and that the decision problem is NP-complete when $q$ is arbitrary. However the complexity status of the problem for fixed $q$ was open for $q &gt; 2$. We show that, for a $q$-colored digraph $G$ and a vertex $s$ in $G$, the number of $\alpha$-colored arborescences in $G$ rooted at $s$ for all color-constraints $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^q$ can be read from the determinant of a symbolic matrix in $q-1$ indeterminates. This result extends Tutte's matrix-tree theorem for directed graphs and gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the counting and decision problems for fixed $q$. We also use it to design an algorithm that finds an $\alpha$-colored arborescence when one exists. Finally, we study the weighted variant of the problem and give a polynomial-time algorithm (when $q$ is fixed) which finds a minimum weight solution.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) hierarchy. This is a Spoiler--Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler--Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's hierarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). We actually show that $7$ pebbles and $7$ rounds suffice. In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $7$ variables and quantifier depth $7$.</description>

      <title>Testing classical properties from quantum data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Properties of Boolean functions can often be tested much faster than the functions can be learned. However, this advantage usually disappears when testers are limited to random samples of a function $f$--a natural setting for data science--rather than queries. In this work we initiate the study of a quantum version of this "data science scenario": quantum algorithms that test properties of $f$ solely from quantum data in the form of copies of the function state $|f\rangle \propto \sum_x|x,f(x)\rangle$.
  $\bullet$ New tests. For three well-established properties--monotonicity, symmetry, and triangle-freeness--we show that the speedup lost when restricting classical testers to sampled data can be recovered by quantum algorithms operating solely from quantum data.
  $\bullet$ Inadequacy of Fourier sampling. Our new testers use techniques beyond quantum Fourier sampling, and we show that this necessary. In particular, there is no constant-complexity tester for symmetry relying solely on Fourier sampling and random classical samples.
  $\bullet$ Classical queries vs. quantum data. We exhibit a testing problem that can be solved from $O(1)$ classical queries but that requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ function state copies. The Forrelation problem provides a separation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction, so we conclude that quantum data and classical queries are "maximally incomparable" resources for testing.
  $\bullet$ Towards lower bounds. We also begin the study of lower bounds for testing from quantum data. For quantum monotonicity testing, we prove that the ensembles of Goldreich et al. (2000) and Black (2023), which give exponential lower bounds for classical sample-based testing, do not yield any nontrivial lower bounds for testing from quantum data. New insights specific to quantum data will be required for proving copy complexity lower bounds for testing in this model.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Symmetric Equilibria in Min-Max Optimization and Team Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing stationary points in min-max optimization, with a particular focus on the special case of computing Nash equilibria in (two-)team zero-sum games.
  We first show that computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in $3$-player \emph{adversarial} team games -- wherein a team of $2$ players competes against a \emph{single} adversary -- is \textsf{CLS}-complete, resolving the complexity of Nash equilibria in such settings. Our proof proceeds by reducing from \emph{symmetric} $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in \emph{symmetric}, identical-payoff, two-player games, by suitably leveraging the adversarial player so as to enforce symmetry -- without disturbing the structure of the game. In particular, the class of instances we construct comprises solely polymatrix games, thereby also settling a question left open by Hollender, Maystre, and Nagarajan (2024). We also provide some further results concerning equilibrium computation in adversarial team games.
  Moreover, we establish that computing \emph{symmetric} (first-order) equilibria in \emph{symmetric} min-max optimization is \textsf{PPAD}-complete, even for quadratic functions. Building on this reduction, we further show that computing symmetric $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in symmetric, $6$-player ($3$ vs. $3$) team zero-sum games is also \textsf{PPAD}-complete, even for $\epsilon = \text{poly}(1/n)$. As an immediate corollary, this precludes the existence of symmetric dynamics -- which includes many of the algorithms considered in the literature -- converging to stationary points. Finally, we prove that computing a \emph{non-symmetric} $\text{poly}(1/n)$-equilibrium in symmetric min-max optimization is \textsf{FNP}-hard.</description>
