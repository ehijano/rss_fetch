      <title>An eco-friendly universal strategy via ribavirin to achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The grain boundaries of perovskite films prepared by the solution method are highly disordered, with a large number of defects existing at the grain boundaries. These defect sites promote the decomposition of perovskite. Here, we use ribavirin obtained through bacillus subtilis fermentation to regulate the crystal growth of perovskite, inducing changes in the work function and energy level structure of perovskite, which significantly reduces the defect density. Based on density functional theory calculations, the defect formation energies of VI, VMA, VPb, and PbI in perovskite are improved. This increases the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag) from 1.077 to 1.151 V, and the PCE increases significantly from 17.05% to 19.86%. Unencapsulated PSCs were stored in the environment (humidity approximately 35+-5%) for long-term stability testing. After approximately 900 hours of storage, the PCE of the ribavirin-based device retains 84.33% of its initial PCE, while the control-based device retains only 13.44% of its initial PCE. The PCE of PSCs (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMETAD/Ag) is increased from 20.16% to 22.14%, demonstrating the universality of this doping method. This universal doping strategy provides a new approach for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs using green molecular doping strategies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Abundance of Topological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of topological materials is revisited using advanced computational workflows that integrate hybrid density functional theory calculations with exact Hartree-Fock exchange. Unlike previous studies, our workflow optimizes atomic configurations obtained from the Materials Project Database, followed by precise electronic structure calculations. Our results based on hybrid density functional theory calculations reveal that only 15\% of materials are topologically nontrivial, which is in stark contrast to the previously reported 30\% based on semi-local exchange and correlation functionals. This discrepancy underscores the critical dependence of topological classifications on accurate atomic and electronic structures, rendering the abundance of topological materials much lower than generally assumed.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics investigation of the dependence of mechanical properties of steel nanowires on C concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temperature dependence of mechanical properties of steel nanowires with varying carbon content was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Four interatomic potentials were assessed, with the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. selected for its accuracy in predicting the behavior of BCC Fe, FeC in the B1 rock salt structure, and BCC iron with carbon. Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted on FeC nanowires with carbon concentrations of 0-10% at temperatures ranging from 0.1 K to 900 K. Stress-strain curves were analyzed to determine Young's modulus, yield stress, and ultimate tensile strength (UTS). Results showed that Young's modulus increased between 0.1 K and 300 K but decreased between 600 K and 900 K with increasing carbon content. Both yield stress and UTS decreased progressively with higher carbon percentages. Common Neighbor Analysis revealed rapid formation of slip planes as carbon content increased and greater slip plane propagation at elevated temperatures, contributing to reduced nanowire strength. These findings provide insights into the influence of carbon content and temperature on the mechanical behavior of steel nanowires, which may inform the design of nanostructured steel materials for various applications.</description>

      <title>Raman signature of cation vacancies in rare-earth nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a coordinated Raman/computation study of the rare-earth nitrides, a series of intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors, to reveal the presence of cation vacancies. Their presence is signaled by a Raman-active vibrational mode at 1100-1400 cm$^{-1}$, rising steadily as the lattice contracts across the series. The mode's frequency is in excellent agreement with the computed breathing-mode vibration of the six nitrogen ions surrounding cation vacancies. The discovery of such cation vacancies opens the door for hole doping that has so far been lacking in the exploitation of rare-earth nitrides.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Dewetting of Polycrystalline Thin Films: a Phase Field Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state dewetting (SSD) is the process by which thin solid films break up and retract on a substrate, resulting in the formation of nanostructures and islands. While SSD in single-crystalline films is generally understood as a surface-energy-driven process mediated by surface diffusion, polycrystalline films feature additional complexity due to the presence of grain boundaries. Theoretical investigations and simulation frameworks have mainly focused on single-crystalline SSD. In this work, we present and apply a multi-phase-field framework that captures key mechanisms in polycrystalline thin films with multiple grains and grain boundaries in three dimensions. By considering isotropic surface and interface energy and curvature-driven grain boundary motion, we demonstrate how the framework reproduces the key phenomenology of SSD while being consistent with predictions based on energetic arguments. We also introduce refined analytical criteria for the onset of dewetting, confirmed by numerical simulations. Key evidence is given concerning the onset of dewetting at grain-boundary triple junctions. Moreover, we showcase SSD of polycrystalline patches. This work paves the way for in-depth investigations of the morphological evolution of polycrystalline thin films.</description>

      <title>Spin ordering-induced fully-compensated ferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully-compensated ferrimagnets exhibit zero net magnetic moment yet display non-relativistic global spin splitting, making them highly advantageous for constructing high-performance spintronic devices. The general strategy is to break the inversion symmetry of conventional antiferromagnets or the rotational/mirror symmetry of altermagnets to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we propose to induce fully-compensated ferrimagnetism by engineering the spin ordering rather than modifying the lattice structure. Bilayer stacking engineering offers a convenient platform to verify our proposal and readily enables switching between two distinct electronic states by tuning the $\mathrm{N\acute{e}el}$ vector of one layer. By the first-principles calculations, a bilayer system is constructed with monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2C_2S_6}$ as the elementary building block to corroborate our proposal. This strategy can also be extended to inducing altermagnetism via spin ordering engineering. Our work offers an alternative route to realize non-relativistic spin splitting in zero-net-magnetization magnets, paving the way for the advancement and construction of low-power spintronic device.</description>

      <title>Optical Spin Sensing and Metamagnetic Phase Control in the 2D Van der Waals Magnet Yb3+-Doped CrPS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional magnets within the van der Waals toolkit has introduced unprecedented opportunities to develop ultrathin spintronic technologies. Strong coupling between spin and optical properties in such materials can further enable novel spin-photonic capabilities of both fundamental and technological interest. Here, we investigate the optical and spin properties of the air-stable, layered A-type antiferromagnet chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4) when doped with Yb3+. We show that the collective spin properties of CrPS4 are encoded in the sharp f-f luminescence of isolated Yb3+ dopants via strong magnetic superexchange coupling between the two, and that spontaneous magnetic ordering in CrPS4 induces large exchange splittings in the narrow Yb3+ f-f photoluminescence features below TN. Spin reorientation in CrPS4 via a "spin-flop" metamagnetic transition modulates the Yb3+ f-f luminescence energies and exchange splittings. This pronounced link between spin and optical properties enables the demonstration of optically driven spin-flop transitions in CrPS4.</description>

      <title>Frequency comb in twisted magnonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While twisted magnonic crystals (MCs) have recently gained attention for their intriguing linear phenomena, such as magnon flat bands, their nonlinear dynamics -- particularly the generation of magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) -- have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the creation of MFCs in twisted MCs using two-tone microwave excitation. We find that finite twist angles significantly enhance three-magnon interactions, driven by the non-collinear ground-state magnetic configuration induced by interlayer dipole-dipole interactions. The number of comb teeth exhibits a plateau-like dependence on the twist angle, with the plateau's width and height saturating as the excitation frequency of the propagating magnon mode increases. This behavior reveals an optimal range of twist angles and frequencies for achieving high-quality MFCs with a large number of comb teeth. Our findings deepen the understanding of nonlinear interactions in twisted MCs and highlight their potential for advancing moir\'e-based materials in information processing and high-precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Weak low-temperature ferromagnetism and linear magnetoresistance in Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$ with a disordered HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals with a Fe-kagome lattice using a self-flux method. The crystal structure, magnetic, thermodynamic and electrical transport properties were investigated. Structure refinement reveals that Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$ has a HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type structure as the major framework intergrown with a CoSn-type structure, leading to a vacancy of 25% on the Lu-site and disorder on the Sn-site. It exhibits a significant magnetic anisotropy with weak ferromagnetism in the ab-plane below 40 K and antiferromagnetic behavior along the c-axis. The weak ferromagnetism is due to the canted antiferromagnetism with magnetic moment deviating from the $c$-axis to the ab-plane. Besides, an anisotropic non-saturated linear magnetoresistance is also observed in Lu$_{0.75}$Fe$_6$Sn$_6$, probably resulting from the structural disorder in the sample.</description>

      <title>Indium Hydroxide Ceramic Targets: A Breakthrough in High-Mobility Thin-Film Transistor Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film transistors composed of a hydrogen-containing indium oxide active layer are promising candidates for backplane devices in next-generation flat panel displays, offering higher definition and faster operation. However, the hydrogen incorporation process during film deposition poses challenges for scalable and industrial development due to both safety and controllability issues. Here, we demonstrate that using indium hydroxide ceramic as the target material for film deposition overcomes the difficulties associated with hydrogen gas usage. We sintered commercially available indium hydroxide powder using a conventional ceramic process at 150-250{\deg}C in air and utilized it for the deposition of hydrogen-incorporated indium oxide films via pulsed laser deposition. The resulting indium oxide films, after thermal annealing, contained a sufficient concentration of hydrogen and exhibited very high electron mobility due to significantly grown grains. Furthermore, we confirmed that the fabricated thin-film transistors exhibited comparably high performance to those produced using the gas-phase hydrogen incorporation method. This approach offers a practical pathway for hydrogen-containing indium oxide-based thin-film transistors in next-generation flat panel displays.</description>

      <title>Hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating zero-net-magnetization magnets that exhibit spin-splitting into spintronics delivers key advantages: faster switching dynamics, greater immunity to destabilizing fields, lower power consumption, and markedly improved overall efficiency. The collinear magnets with net-zero magnetization and spin-splitting mainly include altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet, which provide possibility to achieve hidden spin polarization (HSP) with net-zero spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization. In addition to proposal of hidden altermagnetism, we hereby introduce this concept of hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, where the total spin polarization is zero, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses fully-compensated ferrimagnetism with non-zero local spin polarization in the real space. By the first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-bilayer $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$ is a possible hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnet, showing fully-compensated ferrimagnetic HSP, which can be separated and observed by an out-of-plane external electric field. Our works provide a class of hidden spin-polarized materials that facilitates the advancement of spintronics.</description>

      <title>Magneto-elastic softening in cold-sprayed polycrystalline nickel studied by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold-sprayed metallic deposits are additively manufactured materials containing high levels of compressive residual stress. Here we show that the presence and intensity of this stress can be analyzed using laser-ultrasonics, provided that the sprayed material is ferromagnetic and magnetostrictive, as in the case of pure nickel. Contactless resonant ultrasound spectroscopy is used to monitor the evolution of shear modulus and internal friction parameter of two polycrystalline Ni deposits with temperature over the Curie point, which enables a direct assessment of the strength of magneto-elastic softening that is known to be strongly stress-dependent. In addition, the proposed methodology is also shown to be suitable for in-situ observation of the recrystallization process in the vicinity of the Curie point, as well as inspecting the homogeneity of the residual stress level across the thickness of the cold-sprayed deposit. Finally, a methodology for room-temperature probing of the magnetoelastic coupling is proposed and tested on the examined materials.</description>

      <title>Diverse polymorphism in Ruddlesden-Popper chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Optimized Synthesis and Device Integration of Long 17-Atom-Wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seventeen-carbon-atom-wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (17-AGNRs) are promising candidates for high-performance electronic devices due to their narrow electronic bandgap. Atomic precision in edge structure and width control is achieved through a bottom-up on-surface synthesis (OSS) approach from tailored molecular precursors in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). This synthetic protocol must be optimized to meet the structural requirements for device integration, with ribbon length being the most critical parameter. Here, we report optimized OSS conditions that produce 17-AGNRs with an average length of approximately 17 nm. This length enhancement is achieved through a gradual temperature ramping during an extended annealing period, combined with a template-like effect driven by monomer assembly at high surface coverage. The resulting 17-AGNRs are comprehensively characterized in UHV using scanning probe techniques and Raman spectroscopy. Raman measurements following substrate transfer enabled the characterization of the length distribution of GNRs on the device substrate and confirmed their stability under ambient conditions and harsh chemical environments, including acid vapors and etchants. The increased length and ambient stability of the 17-AGNRs lead to their reliable integration into device architectures. As a proof of concept, we integrate 17-AGNRs into field-effect transistors (FET) with graphene electrodes and confirm that electronic transport occurs through the GNRs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating narrow-bandgap GNRs into functional devices and contributes to advancing the development of carbon-based nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>A supramolecular ferroelectric with two sublattices and polarization dependent conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility to combine and finetune properties of functional molecular materials by chemical design is particularly relevant for organic ferroelectrics. In this work, we investigate a class of organic molecular materials that show long-range supramolecular organization into fibrillar bundles. In solid state, the material shows ferroelectric behavior resulting from two largely independent dipolar moieties that show up as two separate coercive fields in polarization-hysteresis and capacitance-voltage curves. Moreover, the material shows a long-range electronic conductivity that arises due to oxidation at the positive electrode, followed by electron transfer between neighboring molecules. We find that this conductivity is modulated by the direction and degree of ferroelectric polarization, which we interpret in terms of injection barrier modulation at low electric fields and a recently developed framework for asymmetric polaron hopping at high fields. With two distinct, partially independent dipolar moieties offering the possibility to use ferroelectric properties to modulate conductance, the materials presented herein are a promising basis for multifunctional materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Zn incorporation in CuInS$_2$ quantum dots: X-ray and optical analysis of doping effects, structural modifications and surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique properties arising from their reduced size and quantum confinement effects, including exceptionally bright and tunable photoluminescence. Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly desirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient luminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in CuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common approach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically promotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface.
  Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific precision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial defect.
  Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$ QDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of electron and hole acceptors. These results provide deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the magnetic force theorem for large-scale calculations of magnon bands: application to yttrium iron garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of the magnetic force theorem which allows for direct evaluation of exchange parameters in q-space. The exchange parameters are calculated directly from Bloch states and the implementation does not rely on any mapping onto localized orbitals. This renders the approach well suited for high-throughput computations, where the construction of a localized basis set (for example Wannier functions) often is impractical. We demonstrate the versatility of the method by applying it to yttrium iron garnet, where we obtain excellent agreement with the experimental magnon dispersion without any prior assumptions of important exchange pathways. In particular, the calculations reveal the existence of several inequivalent exchange pathways associated with the same interatomic distances. Performing such calculations in q-space fully accounts for long-range exchange interactions and provides a convenient route for validating models obtained by fitting to inelastic neutron scattering data.</description>

      <title>Volcano-Like Ferroic Transitions Deviating from the Model of Landau Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of abnormal volcano-like temperature dependence of polarization or magnetization with maxima located at elevated temperature, distinct from classical model based on Landau theory. One case is ferroelectricity with long ion displacements and quantized polarizations that cannot be used for expansion in Landau model, and the switching pathway involves various metastable phases where the polar phase is higher both in energy and entropy compared with non-polar phase. Another case is compensated antiferromagnets with two opposite spin lattices of different spin exchange constants. Such difference can be utilized for a unique type of temperature differentiated multiferroicity, where large magnetizations can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching between two Curie temperature with alternating half of spins in paramagnetic state. We demonstrate these proposals by first-principles calculations on several paradigmatic systems, including magnetic bilayers intercalated by Ag ions or metal molecules.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Influence of Sn in Cu-Al alloys: A Third Element Effect Enabling Stainless Steel Type Aqueous Passivation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of Sn alloying additions on the aqueous passivation behavior of Cu-Al alloys was revisited and found to function as a new third element effect in acidified 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The role of each element during the process of aqueous passivation was investigated using electrochemical and surface-sensitive ex-situ and in-operando spectroscopic techniques. The connection between passivation and the atomic arrangements of atoms in the solid solution was supported by first principles based cluster expansion calculations and Monte Carlo simulations probing the chemical short-range order in the Cu-Al-Sn system. High purity Sn, like high purity Cu, did not passivate in the test environment, whereas high purity Al formed a passive film with a stable passive current density of 0.01 mA/cm^2. Cu-xAl-Sn solid solution alloys where x greater than 18 at.%, containing less than 3 at.% Sn additions exhibited lower corrosion rates than Cu-xAl alloys, brought by Al(III) and Sn(IV, II) unidentified complex oxides formation on the surface. A strong influence of Sn on Al(III) passivation was observed, i.e., strongly suggesting a third element effect type behavior. Possible governing processes explaining the stainless steel type corrosion behavior are discussed, providing insights for exploring novel synergies in the design of corrosion resistant alloys.</description>

      <title>Electro-optic Kerr Effect Induced by Nonlinear Transport in monolayer WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) can induce optical anisotropy by modifying a material's dielectric tensor, presenting opportunities for novel characterization and device applications. While the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) probes the linear Hall effect (LHE) in magnetic materials, an analogous optical probe for NLHE in non-magnetic, time-reversal symmetric systems remains highly desirable. Here, we theoretically propose and investigate an NLHE-induced Electro-optic Kerr Effect (EOKE) as such a probe. Focusing on monolayer (ML) WTe$_2$, a prototypical NLHE material, our analysis considers contributions from Berry curvature dipole (BCD), Drude, injection, and shift mechanisms. We demonstrate that the EOKE signal in WTe$_2$ is predominantly governed by the BCD. Furthermore, the Kerr angle exhibits temporal oscillations at different optical frequencies, suggesting EOKE as a promising route for the time-resolved detection of NLHE and the dynamic investigation of material topology.</description>

      <title>Rethinking cryptophane A for methane gas sensing: cross sensitivity to N2 and CO2 at ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the affinity of Cryptophane-A for methane was first reported in 1993, cryptophane-doped polymer films have been extensively studied as enrichment cladding layers in plasmonic, fiber-optic, and integrated waveguide-based optical sensors. While the use of cryptophane-doped layers has improved methane sensitivity compared to undoped claddings, controversy has grown over the years regarding their claimed selectivity and practical applicability. Key questions remain unresolved, including the extent of true methane enrichment at room temperature, cross-sensitivity to other gases, and the proportion of active cryptophane molecules within the polymer matrix. In this work, we employ Raman spectroscopy to provide direct and unambiguous evidence that Cryptophane-A exhibits measurable affinity for major ambient gases other than methane at room temperature. Notably, both nitrogen and carbon dioxide are shown to enter the cryptophane cavity and compete with methane for binding sites. This study underscores the value of Raman spectroscopy as a benchmark technique for investigating gas capture within host molecules at ambient conditions. It offers deeper insight into the binding behavior of Cryptophane-A and enables quantification of its relative affinities to atmospheric gases, thereby revealing both the limitations and the potential of cryptophane for future sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations, Morphological Stability, and Asymptotic Freedom of Plasma-Surface Deposition Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure remains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely confined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop a predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG) analysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the plasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles. The central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic freedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the growing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales, a finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of continuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG framework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area, $\langle A \rangle \propto \exp(\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by fundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\Phi$) and ion collision time ($\tau_{\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed empirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to specific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable predictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within collision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\Lambda_c = 1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on crystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine for predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film synthesis.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle band picture bridging topology and strong correlations across energy scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, primarily hindered by a language mismatch problem. While band topology is naturally formulated within a single-particle band theory, strong correlations typically elude such an effective one-body description. In this work, we bridge this gap leveraging the ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) variational embedding framework, which introduces auxiliary quasiparticle degrees of freedom to recover an effective band structure description of strongly correlated systems. This approach enables an interpretable and computationally efficient treatment of correlated topological phases, resulting in energy- and momentum-resolved topological features that are directly comparable with experimental spectra. We exemplify the advantages of this framework through a detailed study of the interacting Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Not only does the gGut description reproduce established results, but it also reveals previously inaccessible aspects: most notably, the emergence of topologically nontrivial Hubbard bands hosting their own edge states, as well as possible ways to manipulate these through a finite magnetization. These results position the gGut framework as a promising tool for the predictive modeling of correlated topological materials.</description>

      <title>Unifying Chemical and Electrochemical Thermodynamics of Electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batteries are critical for electrified transportation and aviation, yet thermodynamic understanding of electrode materials remains lacking, as indicated by the often-seen violation of the second law of thermodynamics of open-circuit voltage (OCV) models. On the other hand, thermodynamic modeling rarely utilizes electrochemical data such as OCV, entropic heat (dOCV/dT), which contains rich thermodynamic information. This work introduces a framework of thermodynamic modeling of materials for electrochemical energy storage, using differentiable programming and gradient-based optimization of thermodynamic parameters. Using a modified Debye model that accounts for the phonon density of states, the thermodynamics of pure substances is modeled from experimental measurements of specific heat ($c_p$) as well as the phonon density of states $g(\omega)$. Thermodynamics of mixing is modeled with measured entropic heat and OCV data. We demonstrate the differentiable thermodynamic modeling framework with forward and inverse problems. In the forward problem, i.e. determining phase diagram of graphite anode given thermochemical and electrochemical data, we show that in addition to accurate reproduction of phase diagram of LixC6, the fitted temperature-dependent OCV of graphite reaches 3.8 mV mean absolute error (MAE) for test set data measured at 10$^\circ$C, compared with 2.9-3.6 mV MAE for training set data measured at 25$^\circ$C - 57$^\circ$C. In the inverse problem, i.e. determining OCV of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode from phase diagram constrained by thermochemical and electrochemical data, we demonstrate accurate reproduction of LFP OCV as well as phase diagram. This framework offers a unified treatment of chemical and electrochemical thermodynamic data for electrode materials.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-valence behavior in U2Rh2Sb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate-valence behavior is sometimes observed in lanthanide-based materials containing Ce, Yb, Sm or Eu. However, the number of actinide-based systems that exhibit this type of behavior is rather limited. In this work, we present the discovery and characterization of a uranium compound U2Rh2Sb, which turns out to be a candidate for the intermediate-valencebehavior. The material shows a characteristic feature in the magnetic susceptibility around T = 50 K, which can be described within the interconfiguration-fluctuation model of intermediate valence systems. We find the energy difference between the 5f3(U3+) and 5f2(U4+) states to be $\delta$Eex/kB $\approx$ 400 K and the corresponding valence fluctuation temperature to be Tvf $\approx$ 140 K. The value of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ = 50 mJ mol-1 U K-2 signals a modest electron effective mass enhancement. The electrical resistivity indicates metallic behavior, albeit with a small residual resistivity ratio. Measurements of thermoelectric properties indicate a change of sign in the Seebeck coefficient around T = 100 K, with a minimum achieved at T = 50 K, which coincides with the broad peak observed in magnetic susceptibility. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical analysis, based on the first-principles calculations, including lattice dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Magnetoacoustic systems offer promising platforms for next-generation sensors and computing applications, but understanding their nonlinear dynamics remains challenging. Here, we use nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to spatially map nonlinear magnon scattering processes in FeGaB/LiNbO3 magnetoacoustic devices with sub-micron resolution. We observe highly heterogeneous magnetic noise generation under acoustic driving at 1425 MHz, with responses varying dramatically across micron length scales. Time-domain measurements reveal threshold-like nonlinear behavior where NV center spin relaxation rates increase over two orders of magnitude as drive power is increased. These findings reveal microscopic noise sources that limit magnetoacoustic sensor performance while simultaneously demonstrating how acoustic mode engineering could enable selective control of nonlinear magnon processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the present author proposed a Theory of Cross Phenomena (TCP), which asserts that the flux of a molar quantity is governed solely by the gradient of its conjugate potential, as derived from the combined law of thermodynamics. This contrasts with the classical Onsager theorem, i.e., flux equations and reciprocal relations, which posit that fluxes are linearly related to the gradients of all potentials through a symmetric kinetic coefficient matrix. In the present work, the original TCP is revised with the flux equation derived from the first law of thermodynamics and the definitions of the total entropy change and the total work change of an internal process. Although the revision is foundational, both original and revised TCP frameworks lead to similar conclusions with respect to the Onsager theorem.</description>

      <title>Control of fragment sizes of exploding rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fragmentation of ring-like brittle structures under explosive loading using a discrete element model. By systematically varying ring thickness and strain rate, we uncover a transition from one-dimensional (1D) segmentation to two-dimensional (2D) planar fragmentation and, ultimately, to complete shattering. This transition is driven by the effective dimensionality of the crack pattern, which evolves with increasing strain rate. We identify a critical ring thickness beyond which segmentation ceases, and fragmentation directly follows a power-law mass distribution characteristic of 2D systems. In the crossover regime, spanning and non-spanning fragments coexist, enabling control over the power-law exponent of the mass distribution. At very high strain rates, we observe a transition to complete shattering, where the system follows a novel scaling law relating the shattering strain rate to ring thickness. Our results provide fundamental insights into fragmentation universality classes and offer potential applications in space debris prediction, controlled detonation technologies, and materials engineering.</description>

Abstract: Motile living organisms routinely probe their surroundings to adapt in ever-evolving environments. Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates for self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback mechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an experimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending on the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in response to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both features are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled through experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a single colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active Brownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by directed self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar. Next, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a clustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions. Our work suggests how to create adaptive materials with life-like capabilities using readily accessible properties of liquid crystals and colloids without explicitly engineering any of the needed mechano-chemical feedbacks.</description>

      <title>Tunable Interlayer Excitons in Bilayer Graphene Nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertically stacked van der Waals structures are promising platforms that enable layer engineering, opening new avenues for the quantum control of elementary excitations, including optically generated bound electron-hole pairs. Here we employ excited-state density functional calculations to demonstrate strong interlayer excitonic coupling in one-dimensional van der Waals nanostructures derived from armchair graphene nanoribbons. The excitonic response exhibits prominent peaks in the near-infrared range, mainly attributed to intralayer excitons, while interlayer excitations with absorption peak strengths of up to 13\% of the maximum absorption are also observed. Both type-I and type-II band alignments are found, which promote the formation of intralayer and interlayer excitons. Notably, interlayer excitons in these systems exhibit long-lived radiative lifetimes at room temperature, ranging from 1 nanosecond to 9.4 microseconds. Our calculations suggest the potential to tune the excitonic response and lifetimes of bilayer graphene nanoribbons via careful engineering of the stacking order.</description>

      <title>Reviving the Search for Indium-Based Superconductors: Theoretical Prediction of Semimetallic Superconductivity in Cubic Nd$_3$In</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for materials that simultaneously exhibit superconductivity and non trivial topology has drawn significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential to host exotic quantum states. Their unique coexistence often leads to rich physics and potential applications in quantum technologies. Here, we predict cubic Nd$_3$In as an exceptional candidate in this class, combining strong-coupling superconductivity with distinctive topological features. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the strong-coupling superconductivity in Nd$_3$In arises primarily due to pronounced Fermi surface nesting, leading to an electron-phonon coupling constant of $\lambda = 1.39$. Our fully anisotropic Migdal--Eliashberg analysis yields a superconducting transition temperature $T_c \approx 14$ K at ambient pressure, increasing to 18 K under 15 GPa. Beyond superconductivity, Nd$_3$In is found to be a Weyl semimetal, as evidenced by the presence of Fermi arcs and nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants, confirming its topological nature. The combination of strong-coupling superconductivity and nontrivial topological states makes Nd$_3$In a promising candidate for quantum transport and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Significant electron-magnon scattering in layered ferromagnet Cr$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A layered ferromagnet Cr$_2$Te$_3$ is attracting growing interest because of its unique electronic and magnetic properties. Studies have shown that it exhibits sizable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that changes sign with temperature. The origin of the AHE and the sign change, however, remains elusive. Here we show experimentally that electron-magnon scattering significantly contributes to the AHE in Cr$_2$Te$_3$ through magnon induced skew scattering, and that the sign change is caused by the competition with the Berry-curvature or impurity-induced side-jump contribution. The electron-magnon skew scattering is expected to arise from the exchange interaction between the itinerant Te $p$-electrons and the localized Cr $d$-electrons modified by the strong spin-orbit coupling on Te. These results suggest that the magnon-induced skew scattering can dominate the AHE in layered ferromagnets with heavy elements.</description>

      <title>From Bound States to Quantum Spin Models: Chiral Coherent Dynamics in Topological Photonic Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic systems offer a robust platform for guiding light in the presence of disorder, but their interplay with quantum emitters remains a frontier for realizing strongly correlated quantum states. Here, we explore a ring-shaped Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) photonic lattice interfaced with multiple quantum emitters to control topologically protected chiral quantum dynamics. Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad dynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the bath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters. These interactions lead to rich manybody spin phenomena, including robust coherence, directional energy transfer, and emergent double N\'eel ordering, captured by an effective spin Hamiltonian derived from the system topology. We show that topological bound states enable unidirectional emission, protect coherence against dissipation, and imprint nontrivial entanglement and mutual information patterns among the emitters. In particular, we showed that under circularly polarized excitation, the emitters not only inherit spin angular momentum from the field but also serve as transducers that coherently launch the spin-orbit-coupled topological photonic modes into the far field. Our results establish a direct bridge between topological photonic baths and emergent quantum magnetism, positioning this architecture as a promising testbed for studying chiral quantum optics, topologically protected entangled states, and long-range quantum coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with high Chern number (C) enables multiple dissipationless edge channels for low-power-consumption electronics. We report the realization of multiple high-C QAH insulators including C=3,5,6, and 7 in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. In twist angles of approximately 1.40{\deg}, we observe QAH effect with C=5 at a filling of one electron per moir\'e unit cell, persisting up to 2 Kelvin. Furthermore, incommensurate QAH insulators with C=5,6, and 7 emerge at partial fillings. In twist angles of 0.89{\deg}, Chern insulators with C=3 and C=6 appear at fillings of two and three electrons, respectively. Our findings establish twisted rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a highly tunable platform for multichannel, dissipationless electronics and for the exploration of exotic quantum Hall states beyond traditional Landau level paradigm.</description>

      <title>Large ferromagnetic-like band splitting in ultrathin ${\mathrm{SmC}}_{6}$ films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials provide a unique platform for exploring quantum phases from magnetic order in reduced dimensions. While there have been extensive studies on 2D magnetic materials based on 3$d$ electrons, experimental studies on 4$f$-electron counterparts are far fewer, particularly on their electronic structure. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of ultrathin ${\mathrm{SmC}}_{6}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy. Utilizing in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we uncover a large band splitting in the valence bands, which we attribute to the ferromagnetic order driven by exchange couplings between Sm 4$f$ moments and conduction electrons. Despite the small magnetic moment of Sm, the observed splitting is comparable to those of Eu- and Gd-based systems with much larger local moments. Interestingly, the surface state also exhibits splitting with similar magnitude and can be eliminated by overannealing, while the valence bands with ferromagnetic-like splittings remain robust. Our work provides spectroscopic insight to understand the electronic origin of magnetic order in Sm-based compounds. Our study also offers a platform to study 2D magnetic materials based on 4$f$ electrons.</description>

      <title>Effects of Epoxy Composition on the Thermal and Network Properties of Crosslinked Thermosets: A Molecular-Dynamics Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of resin composition on the thermal and structural properties of crosslinked epoxy networks using molecular-dynamics simulations. The systems studied are based on mixtures of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and butylated epoxy resin (BER), cured with diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). A multi-step crosslinking algorithm was used to generate highly crosslinked networks. We systematically explored how the addition of BER affects the network topology and thermophysical behavior of the resulting thermosets.
  Our results show that increasing BER content leads to a progressive loosening of the network, evidenced by longer inter-nitrogen path lengths and larger Voronoi atomic volumes. This structural loosening results in a higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and higher atomic mobility as well as a reduction in the glass-transition temperature. To quantify local steric and topological effects, we introduce a confinement index that captures atomic-level crowding and connectivity. The index shows a strong correlation with the observed trend in glass-transition temperature, suggesting its potential as a predictive descriptor for polymer network behavior. Our findings provide molecular-level insights into how epoxy resin composition modulates network structure and thermomechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Interplay of short-range bond order and A-type antiferromagnetic order in metallic triangular lattice GdZn$_3$P$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc. Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice, suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers. Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exchange bias phenomenon, inherent in exchange-coupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, has intrigued researchers for decades. Van der Waals materials, with their layered structure, provide an optimal platform for probing such physical phenomena. However, achieving a facile and effective means to manipulate exchange bias in van der Waals heterostructures remains challenging. In this study, we investigate the origin of exchange bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures. Our work demonstrates a method to modulate unidirectional exchange anisotropy, achieving an unprecedented nearly 1000% variation through simple thermal cycling. Despite the compensated interfacial spin configuration of MnPS3, magneto-transport measurements reveal a huge 170 mT exchange bias at 5 K, one of the largest observed in van der Waals antiferromagnet-ferromagnet interfaces. This substantial magnitude of the exchange bias is linked to an anomalous weak ferromagnetic ordering in MnPS3 below 40 K. On the other hand, the tunability of exchange bias during thermal cycling is ascribed to the modified arrangement of interfacial atoms and changes in the vdW gap during field cooling. Our findings highlight a robust and easily adjustable exchange bias in van der Waals antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic heterostructures, presenting a straightforward approach to enhance other interface-related spintronic phenomena for practical applications. A detailed study of the interface reveals migration of atoms between the layers, leading to the formation of amorphous region on either side of the van der Waals gap, underscoring the importance of precise characterization of interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, which are often presumed to have pristine interfaces.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a materials search method combining a data assimilation technique based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution with Bayesian optimization. The efficiency of the search using this method was demonstrated using a pair of example functions. By combining Bayesian optimization with the data assimilation technique, the maximum value of the example function was found more efficiently compared to ordinary Bayesian optimization without the data assimilation. A practical demonstration was also conducted by constructing a data assimilation model for the bandgap of (Sr$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$La$_{x_{1}}$Na$_{x_{2}}$)(Ti$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$Ga$_{x_{1}}$Ta$_{x_{2}}$)O$_{3}$. The concentration dependence of the bandgap was analyzed, and synthesis was performed with chemical compositions in the sparse region of the training data points to validate the predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is the prototypical example of a material exhibiting negative thermal expansion (NTE). It is now widely accepted that in ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$, and in many other framework materials exhibiting NTE, a collection of low energy phonon modes, as opposed to just one or two, are responsible for the anomalous thermal properties. However, quantitative verification and analysis of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations which underpin this proposal are still lacking. In particular, probing the low energy phonons directly throughout reciprocal space using inelastic neutron scattering, as opposed to other techniques which only probe the Brillouin zone center, is technically challenging and hence rarely done. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering measurements in a large number of Brillouin zones over a 400 K temperature range. We find excellent agreement between DFT calculations and experimental data at low temperature. However, the shifts in phonon modes predicted by DFT due to the reduction in lattice parameter (warming) are not observed. This is most likely due to counteractive anharmonic effects, which we verified using finite temperature molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Notwithstanding, both DFT and MD results are consistent with NTE in ZrW$_{2}$O$_{8}$ arising from the tension effect, and by extension this explanation is supported by the neutron scattering results.</description>

      <title>Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational method and apply it to study phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni). The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both the wave vector $\vec{q}$ and the phonon frequency $\omega$. To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with frozen-phonon multislice calculations predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10--20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of considering phonon-specific behavior in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

      <title>Which chromium-sulfur compounds exist as 2D material?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) chromium-sulfides are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy using graphene as a substrate. Structure characterization by employing scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron diffraction indicates that there are two 2D phases, Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D and Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D, which have not been reported before. Cr$_{2\frac{2}{3}}$S$_4$-2D is related to bulk Cr$_5$S$_6$, but thinner than a bulk unit cell. For Cr$_2$S$_3$-2D, an even thinner material, no bulk counterpart exists. Both 2D materials are found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions and exhibit interesting electronic properties. Extensive first-principles calculations provide further insight into the electronic structure of these systems and indicate that they should be magnetic. Although single layers of CrS$_2$ were predicted to be stable by density functional theory calculations and reported in previous experimental studies, we were unable to synthesize CrS$_2$ under our range of experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-induced second-harmonic generation in quantum paraelectrics: hot-phonon effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent terahertz-pump second-harmonic-generation(SHG)-probe measurements of quantum paraelectrics observed a significant long-lived non-oscillatory SHG component following an ultrafast resonant excitation of the soft mode, which was interpreted as a signature of terahertz-induced transient ferroelectric order. Here we propose a temperature-dependent dynamic model incorporating the hot-phonon effect to simulate the soft-mode behaviors under ultrafast terahertz excitation. Its application to paraelectric KTaO3 produces quantitatively most of the features exhibited in our time-resolved SHG measurements and those in existing literature, including a long-lived non-oscillatory SHG response, SHG oscillations at twice the soft-mode frequency, SHG dampings as well as temperature and field-strength dependencies. We conclude that the observed terahertz-induced non-oscillatory SHG response in quantum paraelectrics is a consequence of the induced nonequilibrium hot-phonon effect, offering an alternative to its existing interpretation as a signature of transient ferroelectric order.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Power Laws for Edge Dislocations in Nickel Superalloys: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present computational evidence using MD simulations of a size effect for the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of edge dislocation motion in nickel superalloys. We model the superalloy as periodically spaced cubic $\gamma'$ precipitates inside a uniform $\gamma$ matrix. We then analyze the motion of paired edge dislocations in the $\gamma$ phase when subject to an external shear stress for various volume fractions of the $\gamma'$ precipitate for temperatures in the range 300 K to 700 K. The CRSS is found to exhibit a power law dependence on the volume fraction of the $\gamma'$ precipitate with two distinct regimes which have similar exponent but markedly different prefactors across a wide range of temperatures. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior and reduce it to a linear dependence of the CRSS on the length of the $\gamma'$ precipitate along the direction of dislocation motion. We further identify the critical length scale underlying the transition between the two observed regimes as the total core width of the paired dislocations in a pure $\gamma'$ system, which includes in addition to the complex stacking fault separating the partials of the paired dislocations the width of the anti-phase boundary that is formed between the super-dislocations. We present auxillary results using spherical precipitates that exhibit the same trend, but a full analysis of the interplay between size of the precipitate, volume fraction, and other related factors is not pursued in this work. Despite the special configurations considered in this work, the results presented here highlights non-trivial size-dependent effects, provides new details on the strengthening effect of $\gamma'$ precipitates in nickel superalloys, and has important implications for larger scale dislocation dynamics studies for nickel superalloys.</description>

      <title>Neural Object Detection for 4D STEM: High-Throughput Sub-Pixel Electron Diffraction Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-throughput analysis of multidimensional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) datasets remains a significant challenge, limiting the broader impact on strategic materials research. Conventional workflows typically involve sequential, modular processing steps that necessitate extensive manual intervention and offline parameter tuning. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end post-processing framework for large-scale four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) datasets, built around a highly efficient neural network-based object detection model. Central to our method is a sub-pixel accurate object center localization algorithm, which serves as the foundation for high-precision and high-throughput analysis of electron diffraction patterns. We demonstrate a strain measurement precision of 5x$10^{-4}$, quantified by the standard deviation of strain values within the strain-free Si substrate of a Si/SiGe multilayer TEM sample. Furthermore, by implementing an asynchronous, non-blocking object detection workflow, we achieve speeds exceeding 100 frames per second (fps), substantially accelerating the crystallographic phase identification and strain mapping in complex multiphase metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Torsional Behavior of Carbon-Doped Ferrous Nanowires: Atomic-Scale Insights from MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the torsional mechanical properties of pristine iron (Fe) and carbon-doped iron (FeC) nanowires with [001] orientation through molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential developed by Liyanage et al. for accurately modeling Fe-C interactions in body-centered cubic structures. Systematic analysis across carbon concentrations (0 - 10%), temperatures (1 - 900 K), and cross-sectional dimensions 10a, 13a, 15a, ( where a = 2.81 Angstrom represents the lattice constant ) within the LAMMPS environment reveals that increasing carbon content weakens grain boundaries, reducing the maximum shear stress required to reach the critical torsional angle, while higher temperatures promote phase transitions from elastic to plastic deformation due to enhanced atomic vibrations, and larger cross-sections exhibit higher shear stress resistance attributed to strengthening effects from the outer atomic layers. By elucidating these interrelationships between carbon content, temperature, and dimensional factors, this work provides fundamental insights into the mechanical behavior of FeC nanowires under torsional loading conditions, offering valuable guidance for their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems, nanorobotic actuators, and advanced structural materials where precise control of mechanical properties is essential.</description>

Abstract: Kagome lattices have emerged as an ideal platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena in materials. Here, we report the discovery of Ti-based kagome metal YbTi3Bi4 which we characterize using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and magneto-transport, in combination with density functional theory calculations. Our ARPES results reveal the complex fermiology of YbTi3Bi4 and provide spectroscopic evidence of four flat bands. Our measurements also show the presence of multiple van Hove singularities originating from Ti 3d orbitals and a linearly-dispersing gapped Dirac-like bulk state at the K point in accord with our theoretical calculations. Our study establishes YbTi3Bi4 as a platform for exploring exotic phases in the wider LnTi3Bi4 (Ln= lanthanide) family of materials.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave with suppressed long-range structural modulation in canted antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome lattice can host abundant exotic quantum states such as superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW). Recently, successive orders of A-type antiferromagnetism (AFM), CDW and canted AFM have been manifested upon cooling in kagome FeGe. However, the mechanism of CDW and interaction with magnetism remains unclear. Here we investigate the evolution of CDW with temperature across the canted AFM by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS). Interestingly, CDW-induced superlattice reflections become weak after the canted AFM, although long-range CDW order is still detectable by STM and REXS. We uncover a novel long-range CDW order with suppressed structural modulation, likely due to the competition for the underlying crystal structure between CDW and canted AFM. Additionally, occupational modulations of Ge1 in the kagome plane and displacive modulations of all atoms were extracted. The results confirm Ge dimerization along the c axis and suggest a dynamic transformation between different CDW domains.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics of triple-Q magnetic orderings in a triangular lattice: Implications for multi-Q orderings in general two-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Q magnetic structures on two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a key route to realizing topological physics in 2D magnetism. A major experimental challenge is to unambiguously confirm their formation by excluding the possibility of topologically trivial multi-domain single- or double-Q magnetic orders, which cannot be distinguished using conventional diffraction techniques. Here, we propose that long-wavelength spin dynamics offers a universal diagnostic for triangular lattices: triple-Q orders that preserve rotational symmetry and single- or double-Q orders that break it exhibit qualitatively distinct anisotropies in their Goldstone mode velocities, stemming from fundamental differences in their underlying spin configurations. We validate this concept using the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_{2}$, which hosts both a stripe-type single-Q state and a triple-Q tetrahedral ordering at different temperatures. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and spin dynamics simulations, we first refine the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the paramagnetic excitation spectra, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. We then show that the observed velocity profiles of the Goldstone modes agree with the high-temperature model's predictions: markedly anisotropic for the single-Q phase and near isotropic for the triple-Q phase. Importantly, this contrast persists across various exchange parameters, highlighting its model-independent nature and suggesting potential applicability to other 2D lattice systems. This work provides universal insight into the dynamical properties of topological multi-Q magnetic orderings in 2D lattice structures, offering a broadly applicable diagnostic to distinguishing them from topologically trivial single- or double-Q counterparts.

      <title>Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</description>

Abstract: Recent significant advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model (LLM) systems have enabled Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, including novel scientific research. We develop and demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon vertex correction effect in superconducting H3S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.</description>
