      <title>A survey on embeddings of 3-manifolds in definite 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a survey on the topic of embedding 3-manifolds in definite 4-manifolds, emphasizing the latest progress in the field. We will focus on the significant role played by Donaldson's diagonalization theorem and the combinatorics of integral lattices in understanding these embeddings. Additionally, the article introduces a new result concerning the embedding of amphichiral lens spaces in negative-definite manifolds.</description>

      <title>Monomial web basis for the SL(N) skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any non-zero complex number $q$, excluding finitely many roots of unity of small order, a linear basis for the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere is constructed. In particular, the skein algebra is a commutative polynomial algebra in $n-1$ generators, where each generator is represented by an explicit $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ web, without crossings, on the surface. This includes the case $q=1$, where the skein algebra is identified with the coordinate ring of the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ character variety of the twice punctured sphere. The proof of both the spanning and linear independence properties of the basis depends on the so-called $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ quantum trace map, due originally to Bonahon-Wong in the case $n=2$. A consequence of the proof is that the polynomial algebra sits as a distinguished subalgebra of the L\^{e}-Sikora $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ stated skein algebra of the annulus. We end by discussing the relationship with Fock-Goncharov duality.</description>

      <title>Limits of limit sets in rank-one symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of continuity of limit sets for sequences of geometrically finite subgroups of isometry groups of rank-one symmetric spaces, and prove analogues of classical (Kleinian) theorems in this context. In particular we show that, assuming strong convergence of the sequence of subgroups, the limit sets vary continuously with respect to Hausdorff distance, and if the sequence is weakly type-preserving, the sequence of Cannon-Thurston maps also converges uniformly to a limiting Cannon-Thurston map. Our approach uses the theory of extended geometrically finite representations, developed recently by the second author.</description>

      <title>On A Potential Contact Analogue Of Kirby Move Of Type 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we explore the possibility of the existence of Kirby move of type 1 for contact surgery diagrams. In particular, we give the necessary conditions on a contact surgery diagram to become a potential candidate for contact Kirby move of type 1. We prove that no other contact integral surgery diagram satisfies those conditions except for contact $(+2)$-surgery on Legendrian unknot with Thruston--Bennequin number $-1$.</description>

      <title>Corks for exotic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a localization theorem for exotic diffeomorphisms, showing that every diffeomorphism of a compact simply-connected 4-manifold that is isotopic to the identity after stabilizing with one copy of $S^2 \times S^2$, is smoothly isotopic to a diffeomorphism that is supported on a contractible submanifold. For those that require more than one copy of $S^2 \times S^2$, we prove that the diffeomorphism can be isotoped to one that is supported in a submanifold homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 2-spheres, with null-homotopic inclusion map. We investigate the implications of these results by applying them to known exotic diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Unknotting number 21 knots are slice in K3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that all knots with unknotting number at most 21 are smoothly slice in the K3 surface. We also prove a more general statement for 4-manifolds that contain a plumbing tree of spheres. Our strategy is based on a flexible method to remove double points of immersed surfaces in 4-manifolds by tubing over neighbourhoods of embedded trees. As a byproduct, we recover a classical result of Norman and Suzuki that every knot is smoothly slice in $S^2 \times S^2$ and in $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$.</description>

      <title>Deformation of Fuchsian representations and proper affine actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to generalize Mess' work and using results from Labourie--Wentworth, Potrie--Sambarino and Smilga, to show that inside Hitchin representations, infinitesimal deformations of Fuchsian representations of a cocompact surface group do not act properly along the directions corresponding to the sum of a mixed odd differential and a $2m$-differential for any $1\leq m \leq \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$.
  In the process, we introduce affine versions of cross ratios and triple ratios. We introduce Margulis invariants and relate them with affine crossratios and infinitesimal Jordan projections. We obtain a general equivalent criterion for existence of proper affine actions in terms of the structure of the Margulis invariant spectra. Also, using a stability argument we show the existence of proper affine actions of non-abelian free groups whose linear part is a Hitchin representation.</description>

      <title>Five tori in $S^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ivansic proved that there is a link $L$ of five tori in $S^4$ with hyperbolic complement. We describe $L$ explicitly and study its properties, and discover that $L$ is in many aspects similar to the Borromean rings in $S^3$. In particular the following hold: (1) Any two tori in $L$ are unlinked, but three are not; (2) The complement $M=S^4\setminus L$ is integral arithmetic hyperbolic; (3) The symmetry group of $L$ acts $k$-transitively on its components for all $k$; (4) The double branched covering over $L$ has geometry $\mathbb H^2 \times \mathbb H^2$; (5) The fundamental group of $M$ has a nice presentation via commutators; (6) The Alexander ideal is explicit; (7) Every class $x\in H^1(M, \mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z^5$ with $x_i\neq 0$ is represented by a perfect circle-valued Morse function; (8) By longitudinal Dehn surgery along $L$ we get a closed 4-manifold with fundamental group $\mathbb Z^5$; (9) The link $L$ can be put in perfect position.
  This leads also to the first descriptions of a cusped hyperbolic 4-manifold as a complement of tori in $\mathbb R \mathbb P^4$ and of some explicit Lagrangian tori in the product of two surfaces of genus two.</description>

      <title>Taut smoothings of arcs and curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometric and combinatorial effect of smoothing an intersection point in a collection of arcs or curves on a surface. We prove that all taut arcs with fixed endpoints and all taut 1-manifolds with at least two non-disjoint components on an orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic admit a taut smoothing, and also that all taut arcs with free endpoints admit a smoothing that is either taut or becomes taut after removing at most one intersection. We deduce that for every Riemannian metric on a surface, the shortest properly immersed arcs with at least $k$ self-intersections have exactly $k$ self-intersections when the endpoints of the arc are fixed, and at most $k+1$ self-intersections otherwise, and that the arc length spectrum is "coarsely ordered" by self-intersection number. Along the way, we obtain partial analogous results in the case of curves.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives the classifications of certain manifolds $\mathcal{M}$ of dimension $13$ up to diffeomorphism, homeomorphism, and homotopy equivalence, whose cohomology rings are isomorphic to $H^\ast(\mathrm{CP}^3\times S^7;\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, we prove that either $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathcal{M}\#\Sigma^{13}$ admits a metric of non-negative sectional curvature where $\Sigma^{13}$ is a certain exotic sphere of dimension 13.</description>

      <title>Morse homology with DG coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Morse homology and cohomology with coefficients in a derived local system, for manifolds and also more generally for colimits of spaces that have the homotopy type of manifolds, with a view towards Floer theory. The model that we adopt for derived, or differential graded (DG) local systems is that of DG modules over chains on the based loop space of a manifold. These encompass both classical (non DG) local systems and chains on fibers of Hurewicz fibrations. We prove that the Morse homology and cohomology groups that we construct are isomorphic to DG Tor and Ext functors. The key ingredient in the definition is a notion of twisting cocycle obtained by evaluating into based loops a coherent system of representatives for the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Morse trajectories of arbitrary dimensions. From this perspective, our construction sits midway between classical Morse homology with twisted coefficients and more refined invariants of Floer homotopical flavor. The construction of the twisting cocycle is originally due to Barraud and Cornea with Z/2-coefficients. We show that the twisting cocycle with integer coefficients is equivalent to Brown's universal twisting cocycle. We prove that Morse homology with coefficients in chains on the fiber of a Hurewicz fibration recovers the homology of the total space of the fibration. We study several structural properties of the theory: invariance, functoriality, and Poincar\'e duality, also in the nonorientable case.</description>
