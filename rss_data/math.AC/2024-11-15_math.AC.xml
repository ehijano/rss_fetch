      <title>Survey on second submodules of modules over commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with identity. The concept of sec- ond submodule of an R-module (as a dual notion of prime submodules) was introduced and studied by S.Yassemi in 2001. This notion has obtained a great attention by many authors and now there is a considerable amount of research concerning this class of modules. The main purpose of this paper is to collect these results and provide a useful source for those who are interested in research in this field.</description>

      <title>Arrangements and Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop novel tools for computing the likelihood correspondence of an arrangement of hypersurfaces in a projective space. This uses the module of logarithmic derivations. This object is well-studied in the linear case, when the hypersurfaces are hyperplanes. We here focus on nonlinear scenarios and their applications in statistics and physics.</description>

      <title>Infinite chains in the tree of numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One major problem in the study of numerical semigroups is determining the growth of the semigroup tree. In the present work, infinite chains of numerical semigroups in the semigroup tree, firstly introduced by Bras-Amor\'os and Bulygin (Semigroup Forum, 79:561--574, 2009), are studied. Computational results show that these chains are rare, but without them the tree would not be infinite. It is proved that for each genus $g\geq 5$ there are more semigroups of that genus not belonging to infinite chains than semigroups belonging. Bras-Amor\'os and Bulygin (Semigroup Forum, 79:561--574, 2009) presented a characterization of the semigroups that belong to infinite chains in terms of the coprimality of the left elements of the semigroup as well as a result on the cardinality of the set of infinite chains to which a numerical semigroup belongs in terms of the primality of the greatest common divisor of these left elements. We revisit these results and fix an imprecision on the cardinality of the set of infinite chains to which a semigroup belongs in the case when the greatest common divisor of the left elements is a prime number. We then look at infinite chains in subtrees with fixed multiplicity. When the multiplicity is a prime number there is only one infinite chain in the tree of semigroups with such multiplicity. When the multiplicity is $4$ or $6$ we prove a self-replication behavior in the subtree and prove a formula for the number of semigroups in infinite chains of a given genus and multiplicity $4$ and $6$, respectively.</description>
