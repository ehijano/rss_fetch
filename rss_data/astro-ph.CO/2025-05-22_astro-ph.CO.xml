      <title>Fully non-linear simulations of galaxy intrinsic alignments for weak lensing with the MillenniumTNG lightcone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete forward model of a realistic weak lensing galaxy catalogue based on the 740 Mpc hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulation. Starting with a complete particle and cell lightcone covering one octant of the sky with redshift range 0 &lt; $z$ &lt; 1.5, we apply a group and subhalo finder to generate the corresponding galaxy catalogue for a fiducial observer. For all galaxies, we compute both their intrinsic and lensing-induced shear. The intrinsic component is derived from the luminosity-weighted inertia tensor of stellar particles, while the extrinsic (gravitational) shear is obtained through full-sky ray-tracing on the same lightcone. This allows us to directly predict the impact of intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies on the shear correlation function and popular convergence statistics in a fully non-linear forward model. We find that IA modifies the convergence power spectrum at all angular scales by up to 20%, it significantly impacts the PDF, altering its tails by 10-20%, and distorts peak and minimum counts up to 30%, depending on redshift and scale. We also evaluate the impact of the IA signal on the shear correlation function finding that, along with a redshift dependence, the signal strongly increases for higher galaxy stellar mass cuts applied to the catalogue. Notably, with the highest stellar mass cut we apply, the intrinsic shear autocorrelation can become comparable to the gravitational shear component on small angular scales. Our results highlight the importance of accurately modeling IA for precision weak lensing cosmology with upcoming Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>The CMB optical depth constrains the duration of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was pointed out that invoking a large value of the CMB optical depth, $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$, could help resolve tensions between DESI DR2 BAO data and the CMB. This is larger than the value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.058$ measured from the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data. Traditionally, $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ is thought of as a constraint on reionization's midpoint. However, recent observations and modeling of the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-$z$ quasars at $5 &lt; z &lt; 6$ have tightly constrained the timing of the last $10-20\%$ of reionization, adding nuance to this interpretation. Here, we point out that fixing reionization's endpoint, in accordance with the latest Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints, renders $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ a sensitive probe of the duration of reionization, as well as its midpoint. We compare low and high values of $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ to upper limits on the patchy kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (pkSZ) effect, another CMB observable that constrains reionization's duration, and find that a value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$ is in $\approx 2\sigma$ tension with existing limits on the pkSZ from the South Pole Telescope.</description>

      <title>Core Collapse Beyond the Fluid Approximation: The Late Evolution of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos can deviate from local thermodynamic equilibrium. As a consequence, the self-similar evolution predicted by the commonly adopted conducting fluid model can be altered or broken. Our results are obtained using a novel, efficient kinetic solver called KiSS-SIDM for tracing the gravothermal evolution based on the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) framework. In the long mean free path stage, the code is a viable alternative to the fluid model, yet requires no calibration parameters. Further, this method enables a fully kinetic treatment well into the late, short mean free path, stage of the collapse. We apply the method to a canonical case with isotropic, velocity independent scattering. We find that although a fluid treatment is appropriate deep in the short mean free path core, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium develop in the intermediate mean free path region bounding the core, which modify the late-time evolution.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Measurement of the Matter-Radiation Equality Scale in DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peak of the matter power spectrum, known as the turnover (TO) scale, is determined by the horizon size at the time of matter-radiation equality. This scale can serve as a standard ruler, independent of other features in the matter power spectrum, such as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Here, we present the first detection of the turnover in the galaxy auto-power spectrum, utilising the distribution of quasars (QSO) and luminous red galaxies (LRG) measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) during its first year of survey operations in a model-independent manner. To avoid confirmation bias, we first analyse the data using data blinding methods designed for the DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift space distortion and scale-dependent bias signals. We measure the angle-averaged dilation distance $D_V(z = 1.651) = (38.1\pm 2.5)r_H$ from the quasars and $D_{V}(z = 0.733) = (21.8\pm 1.0)r_H$ from the LRG sample in units of the horizon $r_H$ at the matter-radiation-equality epoch. Combining these two constraints and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM model with three standard neutrino species, we can translate this into a constraint of $\Omega_{m}h^2 = 0.139^{+0.036}_{-0.046}$. We can break the $\Omega_m$-$H_0$ degeneracy with low-redshift distance measurements from type-Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon+, we obtain a sound-horizon free estimate of the Hubble-Lema\^itre parameter of $H_0=65.2^{+4.9}_{-6.2}$ km/s/Mpc, consistent with sound-horizon dependent DESI measurements. On the other hand, combining the DESI BAO and TO, we find a truly DESI-only measurement of $H_0=74.0^{+7.2}_{-3.5}$ km/s/Mpc, in line with DESI-only full-shape results where the sound-horizon scale is marginalised out. This discrepancy in $H_0$ can be reconciled in a $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, where the combination of DESI BAO and TO data yields $H_0 = 66.5\pm 7.2\;\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Meta-Calibration of the Cosmic Magnification Coefficient: Toward Unbiased Weak Lensing Reconstruction by Counting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing alters galaxy sizes and fluxes, influencing the clustering patterns of galaxies through cosmic magnification. This effect enables the reconstruction of weak lensing convergence $\hat{\kappa}$ maps for DES and DECaLS by linearly combining galaxy overdensities across magnitude bins in the $g$, $r$, and $z$ photometry bands \citep{Qin+,Qin2+}. In this study, we enhance the lensing reconstruction method by addressing biases in the magnification coefficient estimation, which arise from incomplete consideration of selection effects, especially those induced by photometric redshift (photo-$z$) selection. Using a Random Forest-based photo-$z$ estimation for DECaLS and DES galaxies, we quantify the impact of photo-$z$ induced selection on magnification coefficient estimation. Our results show that neglecting photo-$z$ selection introduces significant biases in the magnification coefficient, leading to deviations in the reconstructed convergence map amplitude $A$, with values ranging from 0.4 to 3.5 depending on the survey, redshift, and magnitude cuts. By incorporating an improved magnification coefficient estimation that accounts for photo-$z$ selection, these biases are significantly reduced, with $A$ converging to $\sim 1$ as the magnitude cuts approach optimal values. This improvement is consistently observed across DES and DECaLS datasets and redshift bins, despite differences in survey strategies and depths. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing photo-$z$ induced selection to achieve unbiased weak lensing reconstructions and accurate cosmic magnification measurements.</description>

      <title>One-loop kernels in scale-dependent Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear evolution of cosmological perturbations in theories with scale-dependent perturbation growth, first in general and then focusing on Horndeski gravity. Within the framework of standard perturbation theory, we derive the second- and third-order kernels and show that they are fully determined by two effective functions, $h_1$ and $h_c$, which parametrize deviations from general relativity. Using the Wronskian method, we obtain solutions for the nonlinear growth functions and present explicit expressions for the resulting kernels, including bias and redshift space distortions. We show that the kernels are entirely dependent on the linear growing mode: once this is calculated, the kernels are analytic up to a time integral. Our approach provides a physically motivated framework for evaluating the one-loop galaxy power spectrum in scale-dependent theories, suitable for the forecasts and actual data analysis.</description>

      <title>The isotropy, anisotropies and non-Gaussianity of the scalar-induced gravitational-wave background: diagrammatic approach for primordial non-Gaussianity up to any order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) produced nonlinearly by the enhanced cosmological curvature perturbations can serve as a potentially powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in the early Universe. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the imprints of local-type PNG on the SIGW background beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations. We develop a diagrammatic approach capable of analyzing SIGWs for PNG up to any order. Utilizing this approach, we derive semi-analytic formulas for the energy-density fraction spectrum of the isotropic background, the angular power spectrum of the energy-density anisotropies, as well as the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of the energy-density non-Gaussianity. Specializing to PNG up to quartic approximation (parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, $g_\mathrm{NL}$, and $h_\mathrm{NL}$), we numerically compute all contributions to these SIGW spectra. We find that PNG can significantly alter the amplitude of the energy-density spectrum and generate substantial anisotropies through the initial inhomogeneities. Furthermore, we observe that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum always vanish when the primordial curvature perturbations are Gaussian; otherwise, they do not, indicating their potential utility as probes of PNG. Therefore, we anticipate that both the isotropic background and the anisotropies of the SIGW background will provide essential information about the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating scalar trispectrum from helical primordial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) as a potential source of the parity-violating signatures recently implied by observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the large-scale structure of the Universe. Among various possibilities, helical PMFs are of particular interest, as they inherently violate parity symmetry and can explain the observed magnetic fields, especially in void regions. PMFs, if generated in the early universe, can source curvature perturbations, which evolve into the present density fluctuations observed in galaxy surveys. Motivated by this, we focus on the imprint of helical PMFs on the trispectrum of the sourced primordial curvature perturbations, a leading-order statistics sensitive to parity-violating signals in three-dimensional space. We derive the analytic expressions for the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations sourced by taking into account both the helical and non-helical PMFs and analytically reduce their expressions by using the pole approximation, whose validity is confirmed by comparison with the exact results. We find that, varying the ratio of the amplitude of the helical to non-helical power spectrum, the structure of the trispectrum qualitatively changes, particularly the ratio of the imaginary to real components of the trispectrum. Our findings highlight the primordial trispectrum as a promising probe of cosmological parity violation in the early universe and provide a theoretical basis for future precise observations of higher order statistics in the CMB anisotropies and the galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <title>The Application of Quantum Fourier Transform in Cosmic Microwave Background Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis and the map-making process rely heavily on the use of spherical harmonics. For suitable pixelizations of the sphere, the (forward and inverse) Fourier transform plays a crucial role in computing all-sky map from spherical harmonic expansion coefficients -- or from angular power spectrum -- and vice versa. While the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is traditionally employed in these computations, the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) offers a theoretical advantage in terms of computational efficiency and potential speedup. In this work, we study the potential advantage of using the QFT in this context by exploring the substitution of the FFT with the QFT within the \textit{healpy} package. Performance evaluations are conducted using the Aer simulator. Our results indicate that QFT exhibits potential advantages over FFT that are particularly relevant at high-resolution. However, classical-to-quantum data encoding overhead represents a limitation to current efficiency. In this work, we adopted amplitude encoding, due to its efficiency on encoding maximum data to minimum number of qubits. We identify data encoding as a potential significant bottleneck and discuss its impact on quantum speedup. Future improvements in quantum encoding strategies and algorithmic optimizations could further enhance the feasibility of QFT in CMB data analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is Sensitive to Dark Photons and the Axion-Photon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nuclear magnetic resonance based searches for dark matter (DM) have intrinsic and powerful sensitivity to dark photons and the axion-photon coupling. The reason is conceptually straightforward. An instrument such as CASPEr-Gradient begins with a large sample of nuclear spins polarised in a background magnetic field. In the presence of axion DM coupled to nucleons, the spin ensemble feels an effective magnetic field $\mathbf{B} \propto \nabla a$ that tilts the spins, generating a potentially observable precession. If the magnetic field is real rather than effective, the system responds identically. A real field can be generated by a kinetically mixed dark photon within the shielded region the sample is placed or an axion coupled to photons through its interaction with the background magnetic field. We show that all three signals are detectable and distinguishable. If CASPEr-Gradient were to reach the QCD axion prediction of the axion-nucleon coupling, it would simultaneously be sensitive to kinetic mixings of $\epsilon \simeq 3 \times 10^{-16}$ and axion-photon couplings of $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-16}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m \simeq 1\,\mu{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>The Bearable Inhomogeneity of the Baryon Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the implications of precision measurements of light element abundances in concordance with the Cosmic Microwave Background for scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model that generate large inhomogeneities in the baryon-to-photon ratio. We show that precision Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) imposes strong constraints on any mechanism that produces large scale inhomogeneities at temperatures of the order or below a TeV. In particular, we find that inhomogeneities of the order of $20\%$ at comoving length scales larger than the comoving horizon at the temperature of $3~\mathrm{TeV}$ are in conflict with the measured light element abundances. This sensitivity to physics at such early times is because inhomogeneities in baryon number homogenize predominantly through diffusion, which is a slow process. BBN therefore acts as a novel probe of baryogenesis below the $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale, and readily rules out some of the proposed scenarios of baryogenesis in the literature. We discuss the implications for electroweak baryogenesis. In addition we show that precision BBN is a new probe of first-order phase transitions which produce a gravitational wave signal in the frequency range from pHz to mHz. This leads to constraints on the electroweak phase transition, as well as the first-order phase transitions that have been postulated to explain the pulsar timing array signal. We also discuss the future prospects of improvements in this probe.</description>

      <title>Geometric formulation of $k$-essence and late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of geometries in which nonmetricity is fully determined by a vectorial degree of freedom and three independent coefficients. Formulating the simplest linear action in this geometry, implemented through Lagrange multipliers, naturally leads to an equivalence with the purely kinetic $k$-essence models with quadratic kinetic terms. A detailed dynamical systems analysis reveals that the $\Lambda$CDM phenomenology is embedded within the model. Crucially, we find that if stability conditions such as a positive sound speed squared and non-negative energy density are not enforced, the model generically exhibits instabilities and divergent behaviour in the phase space. These physical viability criteria allow us to isolate stable regions of the parameter space and derive well-motivated priors for parameter inference. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and late-time observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon$^{+}$ Type Ia supernovae, and DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, we constrain the degrees of freedom associated with nonmetricity and demonstrate the viability of the model. Remarkably, the model is found to be statistically indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM at late times. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the recent cosmic tensions, and give a possible explanation as to why the equivalent $k$-essence models have been missed as serious competitors to $\Lambda$CDM in the past. Finally, we review the geometric foundations of the theory and show that the integrable Weyl, Schr\"{o}dinger and completely symmetric geometries are embedded within our framework as special cases.</description>

      <title>A Match Made in Heaven: Linking Observables in Inflationary Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions of inflaton and graviton perturbations are the fundamental observables of early universe cosmology and remain a primary target for observations. In this work, we ask the following question: are these observables independent of one another? We find that in the parity-odd sector of inflationary perturbation theory, the answer is a resounding no! In earlier work we derived a correlator-to-correlator factorisation formula which states that parity-odd correlators factorise into lower-point correlators under some mild assumptions on the underlying theory. In this work, we show that these assumptions are satisfied in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity where the action of minimal inflation is augmented by a coupling between the inflaton and the gravitational Chern-Simons term. Such a theory gives rise to a parity-odd trispectrum of curvature perturbations, and we show that such a trispectrum can be expressed solely in terms of the bispectrum that arises due to the minimal coupling between the inflaton and graviton, and the graviton power spectrum which receives a parity-odd correction in this theory. The trispectrum is quadratic in this mixed inflaton-graviton bispectrum and can therefore be interpreted as a ``double copy". Our final expression for the parity-odd trispectrum is a relatively simple function of the external momenta that is rational and factorised.</description>

      <title>Confirming HSC strong lens candidates with DESI Spectroscopy. I. Project Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate redshift determinations of both lenses and sources are critical for confirming strong-lens systems and fully realizing their scientific value. However, the thousands of strong-lens candidates now routinely discovered in wide-field imaging surveys make one-by-one follow-up observations impractical. In this work, we investigate the capability and efficiency of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in confirming strong-lens systems. As a case study, we cross-match strong lens candidates identified from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program with Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find that DESI DR1 serendipitously observed putative lenses and/or lensed images in approximately 50\% of these candidates. Analyzing the DESI spectra for $\approx 500$ matched candidates that meet our specific interests, we determine both lens and source redshifts for 27 systems. Additionally, 76 candidate systems feature lensing galaxies at $z &gt; 0.8$, and one candidate system contains a quasar within its lensing galaxy. Applying this approach to other strong-lens candidates will yield numerous additional confirmations, with a further several-fold increase anticipated from the final DESI data release. Our results highlight the growing importance of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in advancing strong lensing discoveries and investigations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the inert Triplet desert region with a pNGB Dark Matter and its Gravitational Wave signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the scalar sector of the conventional hyperchargeless inert triplet model (ITM) to include a second dark matter (DM) candidate, which appears to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). The usual ITM with an extended scalar sector offers a DM candidate along with novel signatures at different experiments, e.g., colliders, gravitational wave detectors, etc. Nevertheless, hitherto unseen experimental detections have placed stringent constraints on the ITM parameter space. Moreover, triplet masses lighter than $1.9$ TeV, consistent with the existing or upcoming collider sensitivity reach, are already excluded from the DM observable, as they yield an underabundant relic density due to a strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge annihilation. Inclusion of a pNGB DM, via a complex $SU(2)_L$ scalar singlet and through the soft-breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry, helps to revive the sub-TeV regime of the triplet DM. This resurgence relies on a proficient conversion between the two DM species. Using this inter-conversion, with the triplet DM as the lighter one between the two, we show that it is possible to push the triplet DM contribution to $50\% - 60\%$ of the total relic density. This offers a significant improvement over the traditional ITM with a single DM candidate, where the same can at most reach $10\% - 20\%$. Besides, the concerned bipartite DM framework also offers the possibility of a first-order phase transition along various constituent field directions. Among these, the one along the real $SU(2)_L$ singlet direction can be a strong one which subsequently yields detectable gravitational wave signals at the upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc., alongside distinctive and complementary signatures at the various DM and collider quests.</description>

      <title>Sequential simulation-based inference for extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals pose a difficult challenge in terms of both search and parameter estimation for upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. Their signals are long and of complex morphology, meaning they carry a large amount of information about their source, but are also difficult to search for and analyse. We explore how sequential simulation-based inference methods, specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation, could offer solutions to some of the challenges surrounding extreme-mass-ratio inspiral data analysis. We show that this method can efficiently narrow down the volume of the complex 11-dimensional search parameter space by a factor of $10^6-10^7$ and provide 1-dimensional marginal proposal distributions for non-spinning extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. We discuss the current limitations of this approach and place it in the broader context of a global strategy for future space-based gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model of quantum cosmology: the Hydrogen atom analogy with dust and Cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe with pressureless dust (modeled via the Brown-Kucha\v{r} formalism) and a dynamical cosmological constant $\Lambda$ treated in the unimodular gravity framework, where unimodular time serves as a relational clock. Remarkably, the quantum dynamics of this system exhibit a mathematical correspondence to a non-relativistic hydrogen atom -- $\Lambda$ maps to energy eigenvalues, the volume variable to the radial coordinate, and the dust energy density parameter to the Coulomb potential strength. This analogy yields a continuous spectrum for positive $\Lambda$, analogous to scattering states. For $\Lambda &gt; 0$, we prove the self-adjointness of the unimodular Hamiltonian, guaranteeing unitary evolution in unimodular time. By constructing wave packets from normalized stationary states, we demonstrate a quantum bounce that resolves the classical Big Bang singularity. The dynamics transition from semiclassical behavior far from the bounce to quantum-dominated regions featuring characteristic "ringing" oscillations due to interference near the bounce. We quantify quantum effects through expectation values and fluctuations of cosmological observables, finding evidence for persistent quantum effects in the late universe. Thus our results suggest that quantum gravitational effects may leave imprints on late-time cosmology, even beyond the bounce.</description>

      <title>Scalar parity-odd trispectrum from gravitational Chern-Simons interaction vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore parity violation in a scalar trispectrum from a dynamical Chern-Simons gravity theory. So far, a graviton-mediated diagram with two vertexes being of general relativity has been studied in this theory by taking into account the impact of a modified dispersion relation of gravitons on graviton's bulk propagators. We instead study a parity-odd trispectrum from both a graviton-mediated diagram, where one of the two vertexes originates from the Chern-Simons term, and a contact diagram by using the bulk propagators in general relativity. After computing the scalar-scalar-tensor cubic interactions and the scalar quartic ones originating from the Chern-Simons term, first we show that the resultant parity-odd trispectrum vanishes in the case of Bunch-Davies initial conditions, which is consistent with a no-go theorem for a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum. Then, we discuss a way to acquire a non-vanishing parity-odd trispectrum from the viewpoint of non-Bunch-Davies initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Matching Cosmic Shear Analysis in Harmonic and Real Space</title>

Abstract: Recent cosmic shear analyses have exhibited discrepancies of up to $1\sigma$ between the inferred cosmological parameters when analyzing summary statistics in real space versus harmonic space. In this paper, we demonstrate the consistent measurement and analysis of cosmic shear two-point functions in harmonic and real space using the $i${\sc Master} algorithm. This algorithm provides a unified prescription to model the survey window effects and scale cuts in both real space (due to observational systematics) and harmonic space (due to model limitations), resulting in a matching estimation of the cosmic shear power spectrum from both harmonic and real space estimators. We show that the $i$\textsc{Master} algorithm gives matching results using measurements from the HSC Y1 mock shape catalogs in both real and harmonic space, resulting in matching inferences of $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$. This method provides an unbiased estimate of the cosmic shear power spectrum, and $S_8$ inference that has a correlation coefficient of 0.997 between analyses using measurements in real space and harmonic space when $S_8$ is the only free parameter. We observe the mean difference between the two inferred $S_8$ values to be 0.0004 across noise-free mock realizations, far below the observed difference of 0.042 for the published HSC Y1 analyses and well below the statistical uncertainties. While the notation employed in this paper is specific to photometric galaxy surveys, the methods are equally applicable and can be extended to spectroscopic galaxy surveys, intensity mapping, and CMB surveys.</description>

Abstract: We train a novel deep learning architecture to perform likelihood-free inference on the value of the cosmological parameters from halo catalogs of the Quijote N-body simulations. Our model takes as input a halo catalog where each halo is characterized by its position, mass, and velocity modulus. By construction, our model is E(3) invariant and is designed to extract information hierarchically. Unlike graph neural networks, it does not require the transformation of the input halo (or galaxy) catalog into a graph. Given its simplicity, our model can process point clouds with large numbers of points. We discuss the advantages of this class of methods but also point out their limitations and potential ways to improve them for cosmological data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." In some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM. When nonrelativistic matter is added to the holographic dark energy, it tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. We show that a long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a more limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study the early Universe, it is essential to estimate cosmological parameters with high accuracy, which depends on the optimal reconstruction of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps and the measurement of their power spectrum. In this paper, we generalize the neural network developed for applying the Wiener Filter, initially presented for temperature maps in previous work, to polarization maps. Our neural network has a UNet architecture, including an extra channel for the noise variance map, to account for inhomogeneous noise, and a channel for the mask. In addition, we propose an iterative approach for reconstructing the E and B-mode fields, while addressing the E-to-B leakage present in the maps due to incomplete sky coverage. The accuracy achieved is satisfactory compared to the Wiener Filter solution computed with the standard Conjugate Gradient method, and it is highly efficient, enabling the computation of the power spectrum of an unknown signal using the optimal quadratic estimator. We further evaluate the quality of the reconstructed maps at the power spectrum level along with their corresponding errors, finding that these errors are smaller than those obtained using the well-known pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach. Our results show that increasing complexity in the applied mask presents a more significant challenge for B-mode reconstruction.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: numerical results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which induces correlations among pulsar timing residuals described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve. Standard calculations of the HD correlation and its variance assume an isotropic background. However, for a background of astrophysical origin, we expect a higher GW spectral density in directions with higher galaxy number densities. In a companion paper, we have developed a theoretical formalism to account for the anisotropies arising from large-scale galaxy clustering, leading to a new contribution to the variance of the HD correlation. In this subsequent work, we provide numerical results for this novel effect. We consider a GW background resulting from mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, and relate the merger number density to the overdensity of galaxies. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a standard deviation of the HD correlation at most at percent level, remaining well below the standard contributions to the HD variance. Hence, this kind of anisotropies in the GW source distribution does not represent a substantial contamination to the correlations of timing residuals in present and future PTA surveys. Suitable statistical methods to extract the galaxy clustering signal from PTA data will be investigated in the future.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the Standard Model IV: Impact of positronium formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first assessment of how the previously unexplored effect of positronium formation can impact on the value of the effective number of neutrino species in the Standard Model, $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. Adopting a Yukawa form for the electrostatic potential, we discuss two possible scenarios that differ primarily in their assumptions about entropy evolution. The first, out-of-equilibrium scenario assumes that thermal corrections to the potential such as Debye screening prevent positronium from appearing until the temperature drops below a threshold. Once the threshold is reached, entropy generated in the QED sector from the equilibration process, if instantaneous, leads to a variation in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ of at most $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \sim 10^{-4}$, comparable to other uncertainties in the current benchmark value for $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. A more gradual formation could however yield a larger change. The second, equilibrium scenario assumes the QED sector to stay in equilibrium at all times. In this case, we show that cancellations between the first, $s$-wave bound- and scattering-states contributions ensure that it is possible to evolve the system across the bound-state formation threshold without generating entropy in the QED sector. The corresponding change in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ then closely matches the $\mathcal{O}(e^2)$ perturbative result derived in previous works and the $\mathcal{O}(e^4)$ contribution is capped at $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$. We also comment on the impact of deviations from a pure Yukawa potential due to the presence of a thermal width.</description>

Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>

      <title>Emission and detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from highly eccentric orbits of compact binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultrahigh frequency emission of gravitational waves by binary systems of black holes has recently been investigated in details in the framework of new experimental ideas around resonant cavities. In this article, we consider the case of elliptic trajectories. At fixed masses and frequency, we conclude that the total amount of energy radiated by the system within the bandwidth of the detector can be significantly higher than for circular orbits. However, owing to subtle experimental effects, the signal-to-noise ratio is, overall, a decreasing function of the eccentricity. Limits on the maximum distance at which a merging system of black holes can be detected derived are therefore not improved by considering elliptic trajectories, when compared to the circular case. The article is written as pedagogically as possible so as to be accessible to the nonfamiliar reader and possibly useful beyond the ultrahigh frequency case.</description>

      <title>$\nu\bar\nu$ production, annihilation, and scattering at MeV temperatures and NLO accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interaction rates of neutrinos and antineutrinos within a QED plasma determine the dynamics of their decoupling in the early universe. We show how to define the relevant double-differential production, annihilation, and scattering rates at NLO. Integrating over these rates with specific weights, other quantities from the literature can be obtained, such as energy transfer rates, or a neutrino interaction rate. In the limit of massless electrons, we show that NLO corrections to the energy transfer rates are as small as those that enter the previously determined neutrino interaction rate, and only have a small influence on the neutrino decoupling parameter, $N_{\rm eff}\,$. For comparison, the influence of a finite electron mass is quantified at LO. Finally we provide a tabulation and fast interpolation routine for all double-differential rates, in order to allow for their use in non-approximate kinetic equations, which may further reduce the systematic uncertainties of the Standard Model prediction for $N_{\rm eff}\,$.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Neutrino Signals from Dark Stars Seeding Super-Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark stars (DSs) -- first stars powered by dark-matter (DM) heating rather than fusion -- could form in the early Universe. They can grow to $\gtrsim 10^5 M_{\odot}$ masses and collapse into seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We demonstrate that diffuse neutrino flux generated by DSs can be observable in existing experiments and have energies reaching hundreds of MeV, providing novel window for probing SMBH progenitors. We establish first constraints on DSs and DM annihilations powering them using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO will be able to explore DS properties with enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Luminous Mid-IR Selected Type-2 Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 I: Selection, Composite Photometry, and Spectral Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze 23 spectroscopically confirmed Type-2 quasars (QSOs) selected from the WISE 22$\rm \mu$m band in the SDSS Stripe 82 region, focusing on their multi-band photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These objects were selected to be IR-luminous ($\rm flux_{W4} &gt; 5mJy$, i.e., $12.62 &lt; W4 &lt; 14.62 \rm\ AB \, magnitude$), optically faint ($r &gt; 23$) or with red color ($r - W4 &gt;8.38$). Gemini/GNIRS observations were conducted for all 24 candidates, and 18/24 were also observed with Keck/LRIS. The observations confirm 23 to be real Type-2 QSOs in the redshift range $0.88 - 2.99$ (12 are at $z&gt;2$). We collect multi-band photometry and conduct SED fitting. The composite photometry probes the wavelength from 0.1$\rm \mu$m to 10$\rm \mu$m at the rest frame. The IR emission is dominated by dust torus implying an average torus luminosity for the sample of $L_{\rm torus} 10^{46.84} \rm erg/s$. The origin of the rest-UV/optical light is not definitive, but we present three possible scenarios: scattered light, stellar emission, and the reddened accretion disk. Assuming an obscured:unobscured ratio of approximately 1:1, our targets have $L_{\rm bol} = 10^{46.28} \rm erg \,s^{-1} - 10^{47.49} \rm erg \,s^{-1}$ and around SMBH masses $\rm 10^{8.18} M_{\odot} - 10^{9.39} M_{\odot}$, assuming they accreate at the Eddington limit. Compared to previous Type-2 AGN SEDs, our targets have a brighter dust torus and redder optical-IR color. By comparing the SED to the results from JWST `little red dots' (LRDs), we find that these IR-selected Type-2 QSOs have similar SED shapes to the LRDs. This pilot Type-2 QSO survey demonstrates that mid-IR selection is an efficient way to find luminous Type-2 QSOs at $z&gt;2$. Finally, the composite photometry and Type-2 QSOs SED model generated by this sample provide a guide for finding more Type-2 QSOs at higher redshift.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame and present a comprehensive analysis that spans background dynamics, linear perturbations, thermodynamics, quantum gravity constraints and baryogenesis. Using a dynamical systems approach, we classify all analytical critical points for a representative set of scalar field potentials: axions (ALPs), cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential (ekpyrotic) with $\Lambda$, quintessence, and scalar field dark matter. We show that a chameleon-like coupling $f(\phi)=e^{\beta\phi}$ modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. Analytical transfer matrices for primordial tensor modes are derived, revealing a scale-dependent break in the gravitational-wave spectrum whose position and amplitude are fixed by the coupling parameter $\beta$. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. Penrose's Weyl-curvature hypothesis is recovered dynamically: during an ekpyrotic phase with $\omega\gg1$ the Weyl invariant decays as $a^{-6(1+\omega)}$, resetting gravitational entropy without violating the generalized second law. A time-varying $\phi$ simultaneously generates an effective chemical potential $\mu_{B}\simeq\beta\dot{\phi}/M^{2}$, allowing for spontaneous high-scale baryogenesis whose back reaction on $\phi$ is negligible for $M\gtrsim10^{15}\sqrt{\beta}$ GeV. Swampland distance and de Sitter criteria are automatically satisfied because the ekpyrotic phase confines the field excursion to $\Delta\phi\lesssim\mathcal{O}(1)M_{\rm Pl}$. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.</description>
