      <title>Little red dot variability over a century reveals black hole envelope via a giant Einstein cross</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Little red dots" (LRDs) represent a new population of astronomical objects uncovered by JWST whose nature remains debated. Although many LRDs are suspected as active galactic nuclei (AGN), they show little variability on days-years timescales. We report the discovery of two gravitationally lensed LRDs at redshift $\sim$4.3 behind the cluster RXCJ2211-0350, one of which (RX1) is quadruply imaged with time delays spanning $\sim$130 years. RX1 exhibits intrinsic color and brightness variations of up to 0.7 magnitude among its images. These changes are consistent with blackbody-temperature variations of a photosphere, indicating long-term variability analogous to Cepheid-like pulsations but in a far more extended ($R \sim 2000$ AU) and massive ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$) systems. These results suggest LRDs as a distinct class of AGN with stellar-like envelopes.</description>

      <title>The dependence of the intracluster light fraction on galaxy cluster properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use machine learning to measure the intracluster light (ICL) fractions of 177 galaxy groups and clusters identified from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program imaging to explore how the ICL varies with the properties of its host cluster. We study the variation in ICL fraction with host cluster redshift, halo mass, and magnitude gap to investigate how the ICL develops over time, in various cluster environments, and with cluster relaxation. We find that there is a decreasing correlation with redshift (Spearman correlation $r_S=-0.604$, p-value $=9\times10^{-10}$), however this can be plausibly accounted for by including the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and the passive aging of stellar populations. There is a weak negative correlation with halo mass ($r_S=-0.330$, p-value $=8\times 10^{-5}$) where ICL fractions are higher in lower halo mass groups than higher halo mass clusters. We also find that there is a marginal positive correlation with magnitude gap ($r_S=0.226$, p-value = 0.01), indicating that relaxed clusters are more likely to host higher ICL fractions. These results are consistent with a scenario where the dominant formation mechanism of the ICL is galaxy-galaxy interactions such as tidal stripping, and demonstrates the capability of the method to easily construct large samples and study large-scale trends in the ICL fraction.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: A smouldering disk galaxy undergoing ordered rotation at z=4.26</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating galaxies with relaxed gaseous disks have been discovered across cosmic time, from the local Universe to high redshift (z&gt;4). But few such sources have been confirmed at z&gt;4, making them a precious sample to examine what conditions result in such ordered kinematics in an early, more chaotic Universe. One of the best examples of this sample is the galaxy DLA0817g1 (z=4.2603), which shows remarkably clear rotation in ALMA [CII] data. We present recent JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (R~2700) of DLA0817g1, which we combine with archival ALMA [CII] observations to place constraints on its ISM conditions and morpho-kinematics. From a combination of line ratios, we find a high gas-phase metallicity (~0.7 solar), high fraction of obscured star formation, low ionisation (compared to other high-redshift galaxies observed with JWST), and no significant evidence for AGN (based on the WHAN diagnostic). Dynamical modelling with 3DBarolo reveal nearly identical rotation in Halpha and [CII], but with a higher velocity dispersion in the former. Using our metallicity estimate and previous CO and [CII] detections, we derive a new estimate of the molecular gas mass, relieving a previous strain in the mass budget. Altogether, we suggest that this is a 'smouldering' galaxy, where past star formation resulted in significant chemical enrichment (i.e., Zgas and Mdust), but the current activity is low (i.e., lower ionisation parameter and electron temperature). These new observations have opened a window into questions regarding the interplay of gas, metallicity, star formation, and kinematics in a prototypical early disk galaxy.</description>

      <title>Investigating Unusually Extended Main Sequence Turnoff of the Galactic Open Cluster NGC 3532</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended main-sequence turnoffs are observed in the color-magnitude diagrams of some young and intermediate-age star clusters. Here we report the case study of NGC 3532. Among the cluster member candidates identified using the ML-MOC algorithm on Gaia DR3 sources, we found that fast rotators are significantly redder. Stars near the main-sequence turnoff exhibit a multi-modal distribution in the Gaia broadening velocity ($v_{\rm broad}$). A comparison with relevant literature suggests binaries being typically interspersed with fast rotators, often manifesting as slow to moderate rotators. Additionally, chemically peculiar stars are predominantly located in the bluer regions of the turnoff, with those in the fast-rotator region having large values of Gaia re-normalised unit weight error, indicating plausible companions. Our analysis suggests multiple channels responsible for angular momentum loss to account for the extended turnoff.</description>

      <title>Is Crater II disrupting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crater~II (CraII) is a very intriguing, low-surface brightness and extended galaxy in the vicinity of our Milky Way. Motivated by its huge area and the number of RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) detected near to its core, we performed a follow-up campaign to get deep multi-band ($g,i$) and multi-epoch DECam observations in the outskirts of CraII, covering up to 8$r_h$ in the North-East direction and up to 13$r_h$ in the South-West direction (spanning almost 10 degr in the sky across the galaxy). We confirm the existence of tails coming out from CraII. In our survey, we detected a total of 97 periodic variable stars, of which 46 are CraII members [37 RRLS and 7 anomalous Cepheids (AC)]. The RRLS show a strong gradient in distance of 3.7~kpc/deg, which follows the relation: $d (\rm {kpc}) = (-3.70\pm 0.21)\, \xi' + (116.2 \pm 0.32)$ (where $\xi'$ is the planar coordinate rotated to fit the CraII tails). We also found an indication that the gradient in distance in the distant part of the near-side tail (North-East) may be less steep than it is in the inner $5\deg$. The leading tail also displays a significant over-density of RRLS located $\sim 3.25$ deg from the center of CraII. Despite covering a smaller area than previous works, our deeper photometry has allowed us to unveil more variable stars in the region and better define the tidal tails of CraII.</description>

      <title>Stellar feedback drives the baryon deficiency in low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar feedback, as a key process regulating the baryon cycle, is thought to greatly redistribute baryonic material inside and outside the dark matter halos (DMHs), however the observational evidences are lacking. Through stacking analyses of ~400,000 galaxy spectra from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find star formation driven cool outflows in Mg II absorption line. Assuming only gravity acts on the launched gas, our calculations reveal that outflows from low mass galaxies (log M*&lt;10) are capable of escaping beyond the DMHs, which aligns well with our finding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorption along the minor-axes of galaxies using background quasars. This research offers indirect evidence that stellar feedback drives the low baryon retention rate in low-mass haloes, implicating that baryonic processes within galaxies are connected with the diffuse matter beyond the DMHs.</description>

      <title>First Statistical Detection of Cool Gas Outflows with JWST Towards Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic-scale outflows are a crucial component of galaxy evolution, yet their properties in the early universe remain poorly constrained. We present the first statistical investigation of cool gas outflows in galaxies spanning a wide cosmic timeline from $z \approx 1$ to $z \approx 10$. Using thousands of public JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we employ a signal-to-noise weighted spectral stacking technique on the \ion{Mg}{2} $\lambda\lambda2796, 2803$ absorption doublet. We robustly detect blueshifted \ion{Mg}{2} absorption in all stellar mass and redshift bins. The outflow equivalent width exhibits a strong, positive correlation with stellar mass ($M_*$) at all epochs, increasing from $\sim 1$~\AA\ at $M_* \approx 10^9~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ to over $3$~\AA\ at $M_* &gt; 10^{10.5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Our work provides the first statistical constraints on cool outflows in the low-mass ($M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$), high-redshift ($z &gt; 3$) regime, vital for constraining feedback in the numerous progenitors of typical present-day galaxies. Crucially, the scaling relation between outflow properties and stellar mass shows no significant evolution at $z &gt; 3$. This suggests a persistent, unevolving feedback mechanism governing the baryon cycle in the early universe, placing strong constraints on models that invoke a fundamental change in feedback physics at Cosmic Dawn, such as the feedback-free starburst model.</description>

      <title>Stellar cores live long and prosper in cuspy dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of cuspy or cored centers of dark matter halos is a crucial discriminant between different dark matter models. It has recently been claimed based on dynamical arguments that perfectly cored stellar systems cannot survive inside cuspy dark matter halos, which would make the observation of stellar cores in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, where dark matter cores cannot form through baryonic processes, a direct falsification of the cold dark matter paradigm. Here, we use idealized simulations to show explicitly that cored stellar systems like those observed in dwarf galaxies can be stable within cuspy dark matter halos over at least several Hubble times. We also demonstrate that observations of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies cannot distinguish mildly positive, flat, or negative inner density slopes, further precluding the dynamical inference of the gravitational potential from the stellar configuration.</description>

      <title>Multi-band ALMA Polarization Observations of BHB07-11 Reveal Aligned Dust Grains in Complex Spiral Arm Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\lambda$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\lambda$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\lambda$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Plane under the Influence of Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectories of test particles in a time-varying nonspherical gravitational potential model of our Galaxy are considered. The role of the quadrupole component of the potential, which at distances greater than 50 kpc is associated with the distribution of matter in the Galaxy's neighborhood (mainly with the influence of the galaxy M31), is studied. It is shown that perturbations of the potential created by the environment can significantly change the trajectories of particles at distances greater than 100 kpc from the Galactic center, but the magnitude of this effect depends on the still poorly known trajectory of the galaxy M31. For some variants of this trajectory, structures resembling a "thin plane" of satellite galaxies cannot exist for more than 2-3 billion years.</description>

      <title>A new Gaia census of OB associations within 1 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OB associations are primordial tracers of star formation and Galactic structure. Originally defined about 80 years ago, their historical membership lists have been superseded thanks to the precise astrometry from ESA's \textit{Gaia}'s satellite. Recent studies have however been mostly focused on individual OB associations or limited by the coverage of spectroscopic surveys. In this paper, we exploit a complete census of $\sim$25,000 O- and B-type stars within 1 kpc of the Sun to produce a highly-reliable catalogue of 57 OB associations using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, increasing the number of known OB associations by a factor of two within this volume. We assess the validity of this catalogue by crossmatching our OB association members with other catalogues of OB associations, star clusters and young stellar groups, confirming the high-confidence of our census of OB associations. We characterize these OB associations physically (total initial stellar mass, number of OB stars, ...) and kinematically (velocity dispersion, linear expansion ages, ...). Nearly three quarters of the OB associations (41 out of 57) exhibit a significant expansion pattern in at least one direction, including 13 in both plane-of-the-sky directions, though differences in expansion velocity suggest anisotropical expansion patterns. We compare the locations of these OB associations with superclouds and features in the local Milky Way such as the Radcliffe Wave and discuss the implications for star formation in the solar neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Learning the Cosmic Web: Graph-based Classification of Simulated Galaxies by their Dark Matter Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{&gt;10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.</description>

Abstract: High-mass stars and star clusters form from the fragmentation of massive dense clumps driven by gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. The ALMAGAL project observed $\sim1000$ clumps at $\sim$1000\,au resolution, enabling a statistically significant characterization of this process across a large range of clump physical parameters and evolutionary stages. In this work, we investigated the spatial distribution of dense cores in the 514 massive, potentially cluster-forming, clumps hosting at least 4 cores, to trace fragmentation's initial conditions and early evolution. We used quantitative descriptors, evaluated against the clump bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio as an indicator of evolution. Core separations were measured with the minimum spanning tree method (MST) and compared with the Jeans gravitational fragmentation theory. We used the $Q$ parameter and the mass segregation ratio, $\Lambda_{MSR}$, to evaluate whether cores have specific arrangements or differences depending on their masses. ALMAGAL cores are usually arranged in elliptical groups with an axis ratio $e\sim2.2$, but $e\geq$5 is also observed. A single characteristic core separation per clump is found in $\sim76$% of cases, but signatures of multiple fragmentation lengths not rare. Typical core separations are compatible with the clump-averaged thermal Jeans length, $\lambda^{th}_{J}$, though a population, typical of low-fragmented/young clumps, has wider separations with $l\approx3\times\lambda^{th}_{J}$. The core separation decreases on average from $l\sim22000$ au in younger systems to $l\sim7000$ au in more evolved ones. Cores are typically distributed in fractal-type subclusters, with centrally concentrated patterns appearing only at later stages, but without a progressive evolutionary transition. Finally, mass segregation is found in 110 systems, with its occurrence increasing with evolution.</description>

      <title>Relationship between the $\gamma-$ray variability and the pc-scale jet in the blazar 3C 454.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17689v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3C 454.3 is a flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) known for its high variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, showing structural and flux variability in its pc-scale jet, and correlated variability among frequency bands. This study aims to identify the structure, dynamics, and radiative processes common to the innermost regions of the blazar 3C 454.3. We investigate whether any jet component can be associated with $\gamma-$ray emission and variability. We analyze the relationship between the variable $\gamma-$ray emission and pc-scale jet properties in 3C 454.3 by combining $\gamma-$ray data spanning twelve years with contemporaneous VLBA multi-epoch images at 15 and 43 GHz. Spearman rank correlation tests are conducted to determine if the flux variability of any jet component is associated with $\gamma-$ray variability. Core emission at 43 and 15 GHz strongly correlates with $\gamma-$ray emission. The 43 GHz core (Q0) contributes around 37$\%$ of the observed $\gamma-$ray variability, while the 15 GHz core (K0) accounts for 30$\%$. A quasi-stationary component at 43 GHz, at a projected distance of 4.6 pc, correlates with the $\gamma-$ray flux, accounting for 20$\%$ of its emission between 2016 and 2021. We found a mobile component (Q3 between 2010.18 and 2011.16) at 43 GHz with a projected distance between 0.8 and 2.3 pc and apparent velocity of $\beta_{app} = 9.9 \pm 1.1$ c, accounting for approximately 28% of the $\gamma-$ray emission. The observed simultaneous variability in emission regions beyond the central parsec strongly suggests synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) as the primary mechanism for $\gamma-$ray production in these regions. Our findings demonstrate the existence of multiple $\gamma-$ray emission regions within the blazar jet but also suggest that some of these regions are non-stationary over time.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. V. Detection Rates of Multiplanetary Systems in High Magnification Microlensing Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05182</link>

Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will expand the reach of gravitational microlensing surveys by increasing the number of events monitored and the precision of their light curves. We investigate Roman's ability to detect triple-lens microlensing systems, cases where a foreground star with two bound exoplanets produces detectable anomalies in a microlensing event, using its planned high-cadence observations toward the Galactic bulge. We simulate a large set of high-magnification microlensing light curves based on Roman's expected survey characteristics. A detection criterion, based on a required $\chi^2$ improvement for a two-planet model, is applied to determine whether the second planet can be reliably distinguished from a single-planet (binary-lens) model. Our simulations show that the majority of two-planet microlensing events would be detectable with Roman. Events in which both planets are relatively massive (planet-star mass ratios of order $10^{-3}$), or in which the more massive planet occupies a favorable resonant configuration, produce strong central perturbations, resulting in detection efficiencies of roughly 90\%. By contrast, systems with only low-mass planets ($q \sim 10^{-4}$) or with less favorable alignments generate much weaker signals, which often fall below the detection threshold. In general, the planetary mass ratios and the resulting caustic geometry (e.g., central caustic size in resonant versus wide/close orbits) are the dominant factors governing detectability. Taking into account the expected frequency of planetary systems and the fraction of high-magnification events, we estimate that Roman will detect a high-magnification triple-lens event in approximately 4.5\% of multi-planet microlensing events, corresponding to about 64 events over the course of the full survey.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian versus Eulerian Methods for Toroidally-Magnetized Isothermal Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($\Delta x &lt; H_{\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($\Delta x \ll H_{\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($\Delta x \gg H_{\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors.</description>

      <title>Ruminations Upon the Modeling of X-ray Foregrounds, Backgrounds and Faint Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the goal of extracting as much information as possible from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of faint, diffuse sources such as galaxy clusters, as well as those of future X-ray telescopes, we present a strategy for forward modeling all the foreground and background signals present in these data. This work leverages widespread efforts to understand the soft X-ray emission from the Galaxy, as well as the cosmic X-ray background and instrument-specific, particle-induced backgrounds. Statistically, a forward model of the foregrounds and backgrounds is preferable to alternatives because it requires no binning of the data, and allows straightforward marginalization over systematic uncertainties. We apply these methods to several galaxy clusters at intermediate-to-high redshifts, spanning a range of masses and morphologies, using Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data. Our results suggest a modest improvement even for relatively bright clusters at these redshifts, and more substantial advantages in the high-redshift, low-surface-brightness regime. We also discuss and provide a simple correction for a time-dependent miscalibration of the Chandra ACIS detectors identified in archival galaxy cluster data.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Majorana Dark Matter and Its Self-Interactions in a Gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an inelastic Majorana dark matter model gauged by $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, featuring a complex scalar and fermions with a small Dirac mass. The model exhibits strong interactions between the dark fermion-antifermion pair and the scalar, with a large coupling generating a Majorana mass after symmetry breaking. The dark fermion splits into two nearly degenerate Majorana eigenstates, with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson $Z^\prime$ interacting via inelastic axial vector currents. The lighter Majorana serves as dark matter (DM), while the heavier may also contribute. The model predicts DM masses ranging from about 10 GeV to hundreds of GeV, with the scalar favored below 100 MeV. Strong coupling causes DM particles to mainly annihilate into two scalars, which determines the relic abundance, while thermal equilibrium with the bath occurs through $Z^\prime$ interactions. Self-interacting DM particles scatter via ladder exchange of strongly coupled light scalars, helping resolve small-scale issues. The $Z^\prime$ interacts with the muon, affecting its magnetic moment and explaining the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy. Effects on experiments, $N_{\text{eff}}$, and the Hubble tension from kinetic mixing between $Z^\prime$ and the photon, originating from high-energy scales, are discussed. The model details and parameter constraints used in experiments are also covered.</description>

      <title>The X-ray/UV Connection in NGC 5548: A Rapidly Varying Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent intensive monitoring campaigns of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have provided simultaneous X-ray, UV, and optical data of unprecedented quality. The observations reveal a strong correlation between the UV and optical variability, but a weaker correlation between the X-ray and UV bands, challenging the standard X-ray reprocessing scenario. We revisit the X-ray/UV connection in NGC 5548 by fitting archival 2014 HST and Swift/XRT light curves assuming X-ray reverberation from a dynamically evolving X-ray corona. Our results show that, as long as the corona height, photon index and power vary over time, X-ray reverberation can explain the observed UV and optical variability within 2% and 5%, respectively (on average). The evolution of the best-fit parameters suggests that fast changes in coronal geometry and energetics on a time scale of days are required to explain the observed variability.</description>

      <title>SRG/eROSITA-SDSS view on the relation between X-ray and UV emission for quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of using quasars as standardizable candles for cosmology, we examine the relation between X-ray (at 2 keV, $L_{\rm 2keV}$) and ultraviolet (at 2500 Angstrom, $L_{\rm 2500}$) monochromatic luminosities of quasars using a sample of 2414 X-ray sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey cross-matched with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 16 quasar catalogue (SDSS DR16Q), at redshifts between 0.5 and 2.5. These objects are bright both in X-rays and in the optical, so that the sample is characterized by nearly 100% statistical completeness. We have developed a new method for determining the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation, which consistently takes into account (i) X-ray and UV flux limited object selection, (ii) X-ray and UV variability of quasars, and (iii) the decreasing space density of quasars with increasing luminosity. Assuming a linear relation between $l_{\rm X}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2keV}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$ and $l_{\rm UV}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2500}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$, we find the slope, $\gamma=0.69\pm0.02$ (hereafter all uncertainties are quoted at the 68% confidence level), and normalization, $l_{\rm X}=26.45\pm0.02$ at $l_{\rm UV}=30.5$, of the $L_{\rm 2keV}$ ($L_{\rm 2500}$) dependence. These values are not substantially different from the results of previous studies. A key novel aspect of our work is allowance for intrinsic scatter (which adds to the dispersion induced by quasar variability and flux measurement uncertainties) of the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation in both variables, i.e. in X-ray and UV luminosity. The intrinsic X-ray scatter ($\sigma^2_{\rm intX}=0.066\pm0.005$) strongly dominates over the UV one ($\sigma^2_{\rm intUV}=0.001^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$). Further studies should seek to explain this behaviour in terms of accretion onto supermassive black holes and orientation of quasars with respect to the observer.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). From simulations to sky: Advancing machine-learning lens detection with real Euclid data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of large-scale surveys like Euclid, machine learning has become an essential tool for identifying rare yet scientifically valuable objects, such as strong gravitational lenses. However, supervised machine-learning approaches require large quantities of labelled examples to train on, and the limited number of known strong lenses has lead to a reliance on simulations for training. A well-known challenge is that machine-learning models trained on one data domain often underperform when applied to a different domain: in the context of lens finding, this means that strong performance on simulated lenses does not necessarily translate into equally good performance on real observations. In Euclid's Quick Data Release 1 (Q1), covering 63 deg2, 500 strong lens candidates were discovered through a synergy of machine learning, citizen science, and expert visual inspection. These discoveries now allow us to quantify this performance gap and investigate the impact of training on real data. We find that a network trained only on simulations recovers up to 92% of simulated lenses with 100% purity, but only achieves 50% completeness with 24% purity on real Euclid data. By augmenting training data with real Euclid lenses and non-lenses, completeness improves by 25-30% in terms of the expected yield of discoverable lenses in Euclid DR1 and the full Euclid Wide Survey. Roughly 20% of this improvement comes from the inclusion of real lenses in the training data, while 5-10% comes from exposure to a more diverse set of non-lenses and false-positives from Q1. We show that the most effective lens-finding strategy for real-world performance combines the diversity of simulations with the fidelity of real lenses. This hybrid approach establishes a clear methodology for maximising lens discoveries in future data releases from Euclid, and will likely also be applicable to other surveys such as LSST.</description>

      <title>The galactic tooth-fairy and a cosmic bullet: Amateur discoveries and a call for further research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are countless digital sky surveys and automated scans of the night sky which use computer algorithms to detect and categorize objects. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence such surveys will become even more efficient in the near future. Despite this some objects are missed by surveys or pose no initial interest. At times such missed objects are unique in nature and of decent angular sizes, demanding research, unlike the billions of tiny specs of galaxies that would be too tedious to name and study. In this scenario the amateur astronomer and their spirit for old school astronomical discovery steps in, to manually comb the sky and catalogue unique objects as was done in the early days of astronomy. In this paper two unique, previously uncatalogued galaxy candidates, namely Shaheer I and Shaheer II are identified and studied. Both galaxies lay at a distance of 6.67 arc-minutes from each other in the constellation of Camelopardalis. One boasts an unusual morphological profile, akin to a molar tooth, while the other seems to be shooting through space at tremendous velocities. The objects were discovered during visual inspection of digital surveys and then imaged from amateur telescopes at Taqwa observatory, Pakistan's first and only dark sky observatory (bortle 1). We perform photometry using PetroFit to discuss the potential nature of the galaxies and implore further collaborative research to fully uncover their characteristics.</description>

      <title>AGN -- host galaxy photometric decomposition using a fast, accurate and precise deep learning approach</title>

Abstract: Identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN) is extremely important for understanding galaxy evolution and its connection with the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBH). With the advent of deep and high angular resolution imaging surveys such as those conducted with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to identify galaxies with a central point source out to the very early Universe. In this study, we develop a fast, accurate and precise method to identify galaxies which host AGNs and recover the intrinsic AGN contribution to the observed total light ($f_{AGN}$). We trained a deep learning (DL) based method Zoobot to estimate the fractional contribution of a central point source to the total light. Our training sample comprises realistic mock JWST images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We injected different amounts of the real JWST point spread function (PSF) models to represent galaxies with different levels of $f_{AGN}$. We analyse the performance of our method and compare it with results obtained from the traditional light profile fitting tool GALFIT. We find excellent performance of our DL method in recovering the injected AGN fraction $f_{AGN}$, both in terms of precision and accuracy. The mean difference between the predicted and true injected $f_{AGN}$ is -0.002 and the overall root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.013. The relative absolute error (RAE) is 0.076 and the outlier (defined as predictions with RAE &gt;20%) fraction is 6.5%. In comparison, using GALFIT on the same dataset, we achieve a mean difference of -0.02, RMSE of 0.12, RAE of 0.19 and outlier fraction of 19%. We applied our trained DL model to real JWST observations and found that 33% of X-ray-selected AGN and 15% of MIR-selected AGN are also identified as AGN using a cut at $f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.1$.</description>

      <title>MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (8&lt;log(Mstar/Msun)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;80% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 66% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.</description>

      <title>Atomic hydrogen reservoirs in quiescent galaxies at z = 0.4</title>

Abstract: Context. Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host lower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints have been derived so far at higher redshift (z&gt;0.1). Understanding whether QGs can retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching and gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at different epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate redshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs retaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar mass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs. Methods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36, targeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection criterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also perform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent sample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy properties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty galaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower than SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs by a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on the atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than spheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions hosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately 30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content is driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment processes. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to yield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.</description>

      <title>A catalog to unite them all: REGALADE, a revised galaxy compilation for the advanced detector era</title>

Abstract: Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 27,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80%. REGALADE is more than 90% complete for galaxies contributing 50% of the total $r$-band luminosity out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyper-luminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is one of the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in galactic environments probed by Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FRBs constitute a unique probe of various astrophysical and cosmological environments via their characteristic dispersion and rotation (RM) measures that encode information about the ionized gas traversed by the FRB sightlines. In this work, we analyse observed RM measured for 14 localized FRBs at $0.05 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.5$, to infer total magnetic fields in various galactic environments. Additionally, we calculate $f_{\rm gas}$ - the average fraction of halo baryons in the ionized CGM. We build a spectroscopic dataset of FRB foreground galaxy halos, acquired with VLT/MUSE and FLIMFLAM survey. We develop a novel Bayesian algorithm and use it to correlate the individual intervening halos with the observed RM. This approach allows us to disentangle the magnetic fields present in various environments traversed by the FRB. Our analysis yields the first direct FRB constraints on the strength of magnetic fields in the ISM and halos of the FRB host galaxies, as well as in halos of foreground galaxies. We find that the average magnetic field in the ISM of FRB hosts is $B_{\rm host}^{\rm local} = 5.44^{+1.13}_{-0.87}\mu{\rm G}$. Additionally, we place upper limits on average magnetic field in FRB host halos, $B_{\rm host}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.81\mu{\rm G}$, and in foreground intervening halos, $B_{\rm f/g}^{\rm halo} &lt; 4.31\mu{\rm G}$. Moreover, we estimate the average fraction of cosmic baryons inside $10 \lesssim \log_{10} \left( M_{\rm halo} / M_{\odot}\right) \lesssim 13.1$ halos $f_{\rm gas} = 0.45^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$. We find that the magnetic fields inferred in this work are in good agreement with previous measurements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed FRB RMs and have not considered contributions from the halos of the foreground and/or FRB host galaxies, we show that they can contribute a non-negligible amount of RM and must be taken into account when analysing future FRB samples.</description>

      <title>Vz-GAL: Probing Cold Molecular Gas in Dusty Star-forming Galaxies at z=1-6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of Vz-GAL, a high-redshift CO(J=1-0) large survey with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, targeting 92 Herschel-selected, infrared-luminous, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshifts 1 to 6. These sources are selected based on having redshifts and mid/high-J CO transitions from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array z-GAL survey. We successfully detect CO(J=1-0) emission in 90/92 galaxies at the expected positions and redshifts, including 9 tentative detections at $2\sigma - 3\sigma$ significance, and CO(J=2-1) emission in 10 of these galaxies. The CO(J=1-0) luminosities suggest apparent gas masses in the range $\mu {M}_{\rm H_2}$ = $(2-20) \times {10}^{11}~(\alpha_{CO}/{4.0})~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which implies gas depletion times of $(50-600)$ Myr. These timescales show similar spread as local ULIRGs, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent SFR per unit gas mass in starbursts across redshifts. To quantify the contribution of "excitation correction" factors to gas mass estimates, we calculate median CO line brightness temperature ratios of $r_{21}=0.88\pm0.25$, $r_{31}=0.61\pm0.22$, $r_{41}=0.49\pm0.15$, $r_{51}=0.47\pm0.13$, and $r_{61}=0.28\pm0.13$. Accounting for these corrections results in a reduced scatter in 'gas mass$-$star formation rate' relations. We also find a median log(${L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{[CI]}(^{3}P_1 - ^{3}P_0)}/{L}^{\prime}_{\mathrm{CO}(J=1-0)})=-0.71\pm0.12$ for a subsample of 23 sources, consistent with the ratios derived for local star-forming galaxies. Together, our findings are in agreement with common conditions in the cold gas reservoirs among star-forming galaxies over a broad range in star formation modes, efficiencies, and scales.</description>

      <title>The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda&gt;1500$ {\AA} continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Robust Multiband Modeling of AGN Light Curves in Rubin-LSST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor tens of millions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for a period of 10 years with an average cadence of 3 days in six broad photometric bands. This unprecedented dataset will enable robust characterizations of AGN UV/optical variability across a wide range of AGN physical properties. However, existing tools for modeling AGN light curves are not yet capable of fully leveraging the volume, cadence, and multiband nature of LSST data. We present EzTaoX, a scalable light curve modeling tool designed to take advantage of LSST's multiband observations to simultaneously characterize AGN UV/optical stochastic variability and measure interband time delays. EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of $\sim 10^2-10^4 \times$ on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST -- both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields -- thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries. In addition, EzTaoX's multiband capability allows robust characterization of AGN stochastic variability down to hourly timescales, facilitating the identification of accreting low-mass AGNs -- such as those residing in dwarf galaxies -- through their distinctive variability signatures.</description>

Abstract: Molecules harbouring sulfur are thought to have played a key role in the biological processes of life on Earth. We report the first astronomical detection of a sulfur-bearing cyclic 1hydrocarbon in interstellar space. Observations of the Galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 reveal the presence of 2,5-cyclohexadien-1-thione - a structural isomer of thiophenol ($c$-C$_6$H$_6$S). To allow the astronomical identification, we first performed precise laboratory measurements of the thiophenol discharge products system. These measurements, conducted in the radio band using a chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometer, enabled us to characterize this highly polar molecular species and provided unambiguous fingerprints needed to identify this organosulfur compound in space, which now ranks as the largest interstellar sulfur-bearing molecule. These results herald the discovery of a new family of prebiotically relevant sulfur-bearing species, potentially acting as a bridge between the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and the composition of the minor bodies of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Building a Radio AGN Sample from Cosmic Morning -- The Radio High-Redshift Quasar Catalog (RHzQCat): I. Catalog from SDSS Quasars and Radio Surveys at $z &gt; 3$</title>

Abstract: Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (RHRQs) provide crucial insights into the evolution of relativistic jets and their connection to the growth of supermassive black holes. Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z&gt;6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multispecies Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>From Wide Triples to UCXBs: Multimessenger Signatures of Dynamically-formed Black Hole-White Dwarf Systems in the LISA Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim3-27$ ($\sim1-5$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Frame Systematics and Their Impact on the Hubble Constant from Pantheon+ Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a full-sky, covariance-weighted quantification of redshift-frame systematics in the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample with the explicit goal of determining whether such effects can meaningfully bias the inferred Hubble constant. Using 1,543 unique SNe with heliocentric and CMB-frame redshifts, we detect statistically significant but physically small residuals: a monopole offset $\langle z_{\rm CMB} - z_{\rm HEL}\rangle = (-3.8 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-4}$ and a kinematic dipole with amplitude $A = (1.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{-3}$ aligned to within $1^\circ$ of the CMB dipole. When propagated through the full Pantheon+ STAT+SYS covariance matrix, these residuals shift the inferred Hubble constant by only $\Delta H_0 = 0.07~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$, corresponding to about $1%$ of the present $5$--$6~{\rm km,s^{-1},Mpc^{-1}}$ Hubble tension. This shows that redshift-frame inconsistencies in Pantheon+ cannot contribute more than a percent-level fraction of the $H_0$ discrepancy. We therefore rule out a class of proposed explanations attributing the Hubble tension to SN redshift-frame errors.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue of Interstellar Material Delivery From Nearby Debris Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We modeled the trajectories of material ejected from 20 nearby debris disk stars, including Epsilon Eridani (Ran), Vega, Fomalhaut, and Beta Pictoris, within a simulated Milky Way potential in order to quantify their contribution to the population of interstellar material entering the solar system. Our simulations show that material from each of these 20 systems is currently to be expected within our planetary system. We calculate expected fluxes of both macroscopic interstellar objects (ISOs, $\geq100~$m), which could be detected by telescopic surveys, and smaller meteoroids ($\geq200~$microns), which could manifest as meteors in Earth's atmosphere. We estimate that the ISO population originating from these debris disks and currently within the inner solar system is on the order of ~2, only a fraction of the expected total ISO population but nonetheless likely to be discovered by Rubin. Meteors in Earth's atmosphere from these systems are expected as well, but current methods, both radar and video, might require decades to collect even a single event. Our sample is found to be rich in relatively low excess velocity particles compared to the broader expected ISO population, which might make them harder to distinguish observationally from bound objects in some cases. These results provide a framework for linking detections of interstellar material to their astrophysical origins, offering new opportunities to probe the composition and dynamical history of nearby planetary systems.</description>
