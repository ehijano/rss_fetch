      <title>Asymptotic behavior of unknotting numbers of links in a twist family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By twisting a given link $L$ along an unknotted circle $c$, we obtain an infinite family of links $\{ L_n \}$. We introduce the ``stable unknotting number'' which describes the asymptotic behavior of unknotting numbers of links in the twist family. We show the stable unknotting number for any twist family of links depends only on the winding number of $L$ about $c$ (the minimum geometric intersection number of $L$ with a Seifert surface of $c$) and is independent of the wrapping number of $L$ about $c$ (the minimum geometric intersection number of $L$ with a disk bounded by $c$). Thus there are twist families for which the discrepancy between the wrapping number and the stable unknotting number is arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>A Practical Algorithm for Knot Factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing the prime factorisation of a knot, which is practical in the following sense: using Regina, we give an implementation that works well for inputs of reasonable size, including prime knots from the $19$-crossing census. The main new ingredient in this work is an object that we call an "edge-ideal triangulation", which is what our algorithm uses to represent knots. As other applications, we give an alternative proof that prime knot recognition is in coNP, and present some new complexity results for triangulations. Beyond knots, our work showcases edge-ideal triangulations as a tool for potential applications in $3$-manifold topology.</description>

      <title>Bar-Natan skein lasagna modules and exotic surfaces in 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study the skein lasagna module obtained by importing the Bar-Natan Khovanov homology package. For 4-manifolds satisfying a non-vanishing condition, we produce pairs of exotic surfaces (with boundary) by using the behavior of skein lasagna gluing maps associated to connect sums of 4-manifolds. We show that one internal stabilization is generally not enough for these exotic knotted surfaces, generalizing results of Hayden to 4-manifolds that contain homologically diverse surfaces admitting primitive fillings.</description>

      <title>Discreteness of the complex hyperbolic ultra-parallel triangle groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a family of complex hyperbolic ultra-parallel $[m_1, m_2, m_3]$-triangle group representations, where \( m_3 &gt; 0 \), is discrete and faithful if and only if the isometry \( R_1(R_2R_1)^nR_3 \) is non-elliptic for some positive integer \( n \). Additionally, we investigate the special case where \( m_3 = 0 \) and provide a substantial improvement upon the main result by Monaghan, Parker, and Pratoussevitch.</description>

      <title>Estimating trisection genus via gem theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gems are a particular type of edge-colored graphs, dual to colored triangulations, which represent compact PL-manifolds of arbitrary dimension, both in the closed and boundary case. In the present paper, gem theory is used to approach trisections of PL 4-manifolds, so as to prove that:
  - the graph-defined invariant regular genus is an upper bound for the trisection genus of each closed 4-manifold;
  - a trisection diagram can be directly obtained from any gem of a closed 4-manifold.
  Moreover, suitable extensions of the above results are presented for compact 4-manifolds with connected boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topic of fixed points in digital metric spaces continues to draw publications with assertions that are incorrect, incorrectly proven, trivial, or incoherently stated. We continue the work of our earlier papers that discuss publications with bad assertions concerning fixed points of self-functions on digital images.</description>

      <title>Non-algebraic cobordisms between quasipositive knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every genus $g \geq 0$, there exist quasipositive knots $K_0^g$ and $K_1^g$ such that there is an optimal cobordism of genus $g$ between $K_0^g$ and $K_1^g$, but there is no ribbon cobordism of genus $g$ in either direction and thus no algebraic cobordism between these two knots. This gives a negative answer to a question posed by Feller in 2016.</description>

      <title>Some analogues of isoperimetric inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete isoperimetric inequality states that among all n -gons with a fixed area, the regular n -gon has the least perimeter. We prove analogues of the discrete isoperimetric inequality (involving circumradius or inradius) for cyclic and tangential polygons in hyperbolic geometry, considering both single and multiple polygons. Furthermore, we establish two versions of the isoperimetric inequality for multiple polygons in hyperbolic geometry with some restriction on their area or perimeter.</description>

      <title>Contact surgery numbers of projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all contact projective spaces with contact surgery number one. In particular, this implies that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on the real projective 3-space which cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere.
  Large parts of our proofs deal with a detailed analysis of Gompf's $\Gamma$-invariant of tangential 2-plane fields on 3-manifolds. From our main result we also deduce that the $\Gamma$-invariant of a tangential 2-plane field on the real projective 3-space only depends on its $d_3$-invariant.</description>

Abstract: Kontsevich conjectured that $\text{BDiff}(M, \text{rel }\partial)$ has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex for all compact $3$-manifolds with non-empty boundary. Hatcher-McCullough proved this conjecture when $M$ is irreducible. We prove a homological version of Kontsevich's conjecture. More precisely, we show that $\text{BDiff}(M, \text{rel }\partial)$ has finitely many nonzero homology groups, each finitely generated, when $M$ is a connected sum of irreducible $3$-manifolds that each have a nontrivial and non-spherical boundary.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mapping $b_L\colon\mathcal{T} \to \chi$ of the Fricke-Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}$ into the $\mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb{C}$-character variety $\chi$ of the surface, obtained by holonomy representations of bent hyperbolic surfaces along a fixed measured lamination $L$. We prove that this mapping is an equivariant symplectic real-analytic embedding, and, for almost all measured laminations, proper.
  In addition, we show that this "being map'' $b_L\colon \mathcal{T} \to \chi$ continuously extends to a mapping from Thurston's boundary of $\mathcal{T}$ to the Morgan-Shalen boundary of $\chi$ as the identity map almost everywhere.
  Moreover, we complexify the real analytic subvariety ${\rm Im}\, b_L$ after symplecitcaly embedding it in the product variety $\chi \times \chi$ by the diagonal mapping twisted by complex conjugation. More precisely, we geometrically construct a closed $\mathbb{C}$-symplectic complex analytic subvariety of $\chi \times \chi$ containing ${\rm Im}\, b_L$ as a half-dimensional real analytic subvariety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a simple identity relating the length spectrum of a Riemann surface to that of the same surface with an arbitrary number of additional cusps. Our proof uses the Brownian loop measure introduced by Lawler and Werner. In particular, we express the total mass of Brownian loops in a fixed free homotopy class on any Riemann surface in terms of the length of the geodesic representative for the complete constant curvature metric. This expression also allows us to write the electrical thickness of a compact set in $\mathbb C$ separating $0$ and $\infty$, or the Velling--Kirillov K\"ahler potential, in terms of the Brownian loop measure and the zeta-regularized determinant of Laplacian as a renormalization of the Brownian loop measure with respect to the length spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Building on techniques from complex analysis and topology, we establish a remarkable property of branched covers and formulate a complete criterion for the existence of specific types of branched covers between 2-spheres. Our results extend and unify previous work by Jiang (2004), Pervova-Petronio (2006), Zhu (2019), and Wei-Wu-Xu (2024). As applications of our criterion, we present several new families of exceptional branching data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider minimum numbers of colors of knots for Dehn colorings. In particular, we will show that for any odd prime number $p$ and any Dehn $p$-colorable knot $K$, the minimum number of colors for $K$ is at least $\lfloor \log_2 p \rfloor +2$. Moreover, we will define the $\R$-palette graph for a set of colors. The $\R$-palette graphs are quite useful to give candidates of sets of colors which might realize a nontrivially Dehn $p$-colored diagram. In Appendix, we also prove that for Dehn $5$-colorable knot, the minimum number of colors is $4$.</description>

      <title>Minimum numbers of Dehn colors of knots and symmetric local biquandle cocycle invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a method to evaluate minimum numbers of Dehn colors for knots by using symmetric local biquandle cocycle invariants. We give answers to some questions arising as a consequence of our previous paper [6]. In particular, we show that there exist knots which are distinguished by minimum numbers of Dehn colors.</description>

      <title>Dax invariant for closed embedded surfaces and the mapping class group of $\Sigma\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M=\Sigma\times S^2$ where $\Sigma$ is a closed oriented surface of positive genus. Let $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ be the smooth mapping class group of $M$, and let $\operatorname{MCG}_0(M)$ denote the subgroup of $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ consisting of elements homotopic to the identity. We show that there exists a surjection from $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ such that its restriction to $\operatorname{MCG}_0(M)$ is also of infinite rank. As a result, every subgroup of $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ that contains $\operatorname{MCG}_0(M)$ is infinitely generated. The proof is based on a generalization of the Dax invariant to embedded \emph{closed} surfaces. Using the generalized Dax invariant, we classify the isotopy classes of embeddings of $\Sigma$ in $M$ that are geometrically dual to $\{\operatorname{pt}\}\times S^2$. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many embedded closed surfaces in $M$ that have a common geometrically dual sphere, are homotopic to each other, but are mutually non-isotopic to each other. Since $\pi_1(M)$ has no 2-torsion, this answers a question of Gabai.</description>

      <title>Noncompact surfaces, triangulations and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every noncompact surface is shown to have a (3,6)-tight triangulation, and applications are given to the generic rigidity of countable bar-joint frameworks in R^3. In particular, every noncompact surface has a (3,6)-tight triangulation that is minimally 3-rigid. A simplification of Richards' proof of Ker\'ekj\'art\'o's classification of noncompact surfaces is also given.</description>

      <title>Isoresidual curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a partition $\mu$ of $-2$, the stratum $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ parametrizes meromorphic differential one-forms on the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with~$n$ zeros and $p$ poles of orders prescribed by $\mu$. The isoresidual fibration is defined by assigning to each differential in $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ its configuration of residues at the poles. In the case of differentials with $n=2$ zeros, generic isoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation structure, which we describe extensively in this paper. Quantitative characteristics of the translation structure on isoresidual fiber curves, including the orders of the singularities and a period central charge encapsulating the linear dependence of periods on the underlying configuration of residues, provide rich discrete invariants for these fibers. We also determine the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves from intersection-theoretic computations, relying on the multi-scale compactification of strata of differentials. In particular, we describe a wall and chamber structure for the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves in terms of the partition $\mu$. Additionally, we classify the connected components of generic isoresidual fibers for strata in genus zero with an arbitrary number of zeros.</description>

      <title>Continuous two-valued discrete-time dynamical systems and actions of two-valued groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study continuous 2-valued dynamical systems with discrete time (dynamics) on $\mathbb{C}$. The main question addressed is whether a 2-valued dynamics can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group. We construct a class of strongly invertible continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ such that none of these dynamics can be given by the action of any 2-valued group. We also construct an example of a continuous 2-valued dynamics on $\mathbb{C}$ that is not strongly invertible but can be defined by the action of a 2-valued group.</description>
