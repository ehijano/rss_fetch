      <title>Dynamical System Parameter Path Optimization using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are complex and typically only simple systems can be analytically studied. In applications, these systems are usually defined with a set of tunable parameters and as the parameters are varied the system response undergoes significant topological changes or bifurcations. In a high dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to determine which direction to vary the system parameters to achieve a desired system response or state. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimally navigating a dynamical system parameter space that is rooted in topological data analysis. Specifically we use the differentiability of persistence diagrams to define a topological language for intuitively promoting or deterring different topological features in the state space response of a dynamical system and use gradient descent to optimally move from one point in the parameter space to another. The end result is a path in this space that guides the system to a set of parameters that yield the desired topological features defined by the loss function. We show a number of examples by applying the methods to different dynamical systems and scenarios to demonstrate how to promote different features and how to choose the hyperparameters to achieve different outcomes.</description>

      <title>Classification of Principle 3D Slices of Filled-in Julia Sets in Multicomplex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the filled-in Julia set is presented using the multicomplex numbers and an algorithm is presented to visualize these sets in the tridimensional space. There are many ways to visualize these higher dimensional fractals sets on a computer. We therefore introduce an equivalence relation between 3D representations and show that, for the filled-in Julia sets associated to the polynomial $z^p + c$, there are nine 3D slices when $p$ is an odd integer and four when $p$ is even. These results differs from the recent characterization obtained by Brouillette and Rochon in 2019 and the proofs require different arguments in the context of the filled-in Julia sets.</description>

      <title>A CFL-type Condition and Theoretical Insights for Discrete-Time Sparse Full-Order Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the data-driven inference of a discrete-time dynamical system via a sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM). We first formulate the involved Least Squares (LS) problem and discuss the need for regularization, indicating a connection between the typically employed $l_2$ regularization and the stability of the inferred discrete-time sFOM. We then provide theoretical insights considering the consistency and stability properties of the inferred numerical schemes that form the sFOM and exemplify them via illustrative, 1D test cases of linear diffusion and linear advection. For linear advection, we analytically derive a "sampling CFL" condition, which dictates a bound for the ratio of spatial and temporal discretization steps in the training data that ensures stability of the inferred sFOM. Finally, we investigate the sFOM inference for two nonlinear problems, namely a 2D Burgers' test case and the incompressible flow in an oscillating lid driven cavity, and draw connections between the theoretical findings and the properties of the inferred, nonlinear sFOMs.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of numerical instabilities in Next Generation Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. However, ensuring the dynamical stability of NGRC models during autonomous prediction remains a challenge. In this work, we uncover a key connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. Merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags and high-degree polynomials. Ill-conditioning amplifies sensitivity to training data perturbations, which can produce unstable NGRC dynamics. We evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, SVD, and LU) for solving the regularized least-squares problem.</description>

      <title>The relative radius of comparison of the crossed product of a non-unital C*-algebra by a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove results on the relative radius of comparison of C*-algebras and their crossed products, focusing on the non-unital setting. More precisely, let $A$ be a stably finite simple non-type-I (not necessarily unital) C*-algebra, let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\alpha \colon G \to {\operatorname{Aut}} (A)$ be an action which has the weak tracial Rokhlin property. Let $a$ be a non-zero positive element in $A^\alpha \otimes \mathcal{K}$. Then we show that the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A^\alpha)$ relative to $[a]$ is bounded above by the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A)$ relative to $[a]$. If further $A$ is exact and $a$ is in the Pedersen ideal of $A^\alpha \otimes \mathcal{K}$, then the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A\rtimes_{\alpha} G)$ relative to $[a]$ is equal to its radius of comparison relative to $[p\cdot a]$, scaled by $1/|G|$, where $p$ is the averaging projection in the multiplier algebra of $(A \otimes \mathcal{K}) \rtimes_{\alpha \otimes \operatorname{id}} G$. Moreover, the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A\rtimes_{\alpha} G)$ relative to $[a]$ is bounded above by $1/|G|$ times the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A)$ relative to $[a]$. We also prove that the inclusion of $A^{\alpha}$ in $A$ induces an isomorphism from the purely positive part of the Cuntz semigroup ${\operatorname{Cu}} (A^{\alpha})$ to the fixed point of the purely positive part of ${\operatorname{Cu}} (A)$. An important consequence of our results is that they apply to non-unital C*-algebras and give new insights into comparison theory of C*-algebras and their crossed products.</description>

Abstract: For linear control systems with bounded control range, the state space is compactified using the Poincar\'e sphere. The linearization of the induced control flow allows the construction of invariant manifolds on the sphere and of corresponding manifolds in the state space of the linear control system.</description>

      <title>Spatial modeling of forest-savanna bistability: Impacts of fire dynamics and timescale separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forest-savanna bistability - the hypothesis that forests and savannas exist as alternative stable states in the tropics - and its implications are key challenges for mathematical modelers and ecologists in the context of ongoing climate change. To generate new insights into this problem, we present a spatial Markov jump process model of savanna forest fires that integrates key ecological processes, including seed dispersal, fire spread, and non-linear vegetation flammability. In contrast to many models of forest-savanna bistability, we explicitly model both fire dynamics and vegetation regrowth in a mathematically tractable framework. This approach bridges the gap between slow-timescale vegetation models and highly resolved fire dynamics, shedding light on the influence of short-term and transient processes on vegetation cover. In our spatial stochastic model, bistability arises from periodic fires that maintain low forest cover, whereas dense forest areas inhibit fire spread and preserve high tree density. The deterministic mean-field approximation of the model similarly predicts bistability, but deviates quantitatively from the fully spatial model, especially in terms of its transient dynamics. These results also underscore the critical role of timescale separation between fire and vegetation processes in shaping ecosystem structure and resilience.</description>

      <title>Rational points near manifolds and Khintchine theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the long-standing challenge to establish a Khintchine-type theorem for arbitrary nondegenerate manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In particular, our main result finally removes the analyticity assumption from the Khintchine type theorem proved in [Ann. of Math. 175 (2012), 187-235]. Furthermore, we obtain a Jarn\'ik-type refinement of our main result, which uses Hausdorff measures. The results are also obtained in the inhomogeneous setting. The proofs are underpinned by a sharper version of a `quantitative nondivergence' result of Bernik--Kleinbock--Margulis and a duality argument which we use to study rational points near manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the FitzHugh-Nagumo $(1,1)$--fast-slow system where the vector fields associated to the slow/fast equations come from the reduction of the Hodgin-Huxley model for the nerve impulse. After deriving dynamical properties of the singular and regular cases, we perform a bifurcation analysis and we investigate how the parameters (of the affine slow equation) impact the dynamics of the system. The study of codimension one bifurcations and the numerical locus of canards concludes this case-study. All theoretical results are numerically illustrated.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and stability of synchronized solutions in the Kuramoto model with uniformly spaced natural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02889v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical Kuramoto model (KM) with natural frequencies and its continuum limit (CL), and discuss the existence of synchronized solutions and their bifurcations and stability. We specifically assume that the frequency function is symmetric and linear in the CL, so that the natural frequencies are evenly spaced in the KM. We show that in the KM, $O(2^n)$ one-parameter families of synchronized solutions are born and $O(2^n)$ saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations occur at least, when the node number $n$ is odd and tends to infinity. Moreover, we prove that the family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work suffers a saddle-node bifurcation at which its stability changes from asymptotically stable to unstable and the other families of synchronized solutions are unstable in the KM. For the CL, we show that a one-parameter family of continuous synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work is asymptotically stable and that there exist uncountably many one-parameter families of discontinuous synchronized solutions and they are unstable along with another one-parameter family of continuous synchronized solutions.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of continuous and discrete variational ODEs with convergence guarantee and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article introduces a method to learn dynamical systems that are governed by Euler--Lagrange equations from data. The method is based on Gaussian process regression and identifies continuous or discrete Lagrangians and is, therefore, structure preserving by design. A rigorous proof of convergence as the distance between observation data points converges to zero and lower bounds for convergence rates are provided. Next to convergence guarantees, the method allows for quantification of model uncertainty, which can provide a basis of adaptive sampling techniques. We provide efficient uncertainty quantification of any observable that is linear in the Lagrangian, including of Hamiltonian functions (energy) and symplectic structures, which is of interest in the context of system identification. The article overcomes major practical and theoretical difficulties related to the ill-posedness of the identification task of (discrete) Lagrangians through a careful design of geometric regularisation strategies and through an exploit of a relation to convex minimisation problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>
