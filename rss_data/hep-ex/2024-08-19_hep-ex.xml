      <title>Approximate Differentiable Likelihoods for Astroparticle Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, inference in liquid xenon direct detection dark matter experiments has used estimators of event energy or density estimation of simulated data. Such methods have drawbacks compared to the computation of explicit likelihoods, such as an inability to conduct statistical inference in high-dimensional parameter spaces, or a failure to make use of all available information. In this work, we implement a continuous approximation of an event simulator model within a probabilistic programming framework, allowing for the application of high performance gradient-based inference methods such as the No-U-Turn Sampler. We demonstrate an improvement in inference results, with percent-level decreases in measurement uncertainties. Finally, in the case where some observables can be measured using multiple independent channels, such a method also enables the incorporation of additional information seamlessly, allowing for full use of the available information to be made.</description>

      <title>Improved measurements of $D^0 \to K^-\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $D^+ \to \bar K^0\ell^+\nu_\ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 7.93 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected at the center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, we measure the absolute branching fractions of $D^0\to K^-e^+\nu_e$, $D^0\to K^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$, $D^+\to \bar K^0e^+\nu_e$, and $D^+\to \bar K^0\mu^+\nu_\mu$ to be $(3.509\pm0.009_{\rm stat.}\pm0.013_{\rm syst.}) \%$, $(3.408\pm0.011_{\rm stat.}\pm0.013_{\rm syst.}) \%$, $(8.856\pm0.039_{\rm stat.}\pm0.078_{\rm syst.}) \%$, and $(8.661\pm0.046_{\rm stat.}\pm0.080_{\rm syst.}) \%$, respectively. By performing a simultaneous fit to the partial decay rates of these four decays, the product of the hadronic form factor $f^K_+(0)$ and the modulus of the $c\to s$ CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ is determined to be $f^K_+(0)|V_{cs}|=0.7162\pm0.0011_{\rm stat.}\pm0.0012_{\rm syst.}$. Taking the value of $|V_{cs}|=0.97349\pm0.00016$ from the standard model global fit or that of $f^K_+(0)=0.7452\pm0.0031$ from the LQCD calculation as input, we derive the results $f^K_+(0)=0.7357\pm0.0011_{\rm stat.}\pm0.0012_{\rm syst.}$ and $|V_{cs}|=0.9611\pm0.0015_{\rm stat.}\pm0.0016_{\rm syst.}\pm0.0040_{\rm LQCD}$.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Pretraining and Finetuning for Efficient Jet Classification in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an innovative approach to analyzing unlabeled data in high-energy physics (HEP) through the application of self-supervised learning (SSL). Faced with the increasing computational cost of producing high-quality labeled simulation samples at the CERN LHC, we propose leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data to overcome the limitations of supervised learning methods, which heavily rely on detailed labeled simulations. By pretraining models on these vast, mostly untapped datasets, we aim to learn generic representations that can be finetuned with smaller quantities of labeled data. Our methodology employs contrastive learning with augmentations on jet datasets to teach the model to recognize common representations of jets, addressing the unique challenges of LHC physics. Building on the groundwork laid by previous studies, our work demonstrates the critical ability of SSL to utilize large-scale unlabeled data effectively. We showcase the scalability and effectiveness of our models by gradually increasing the size of the pretraining dataset and assessing the resultant performance enhancements. Our results, obtained from experiments on two datasets -- JetClass, representing unlabeled data, and Top Tagging, serving as labeled simulation data -- show significant improvements in data efficiency, computational efficiency, and overall performance. These findings suggest that SSL can greatly enhance the adaptability of ML models to the HEP domain. This work opens new avenues for the use of unlabeled data in HEP and contributes to a better understanding the potential of SSL for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>The Search for the Cosmological Axion -- A New Refined Narrow Mass Window and Detection Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based upon a previous axion mass proposal and detection scheme, as well as considering the axion mass ranges suggested by cogent simulations in recent years, we present a revised axion/ALP Search strategy and our calculations, concentrating on a narrow axion Compton frequency window in this report. The window comprises the spectral region of 18.99 to 19.01GHz (that falls within the Ku microwave band), with a center frequency of 19.00GHz (+0.1GHz), with equivalence to a corresponding axion mass range of 78.6 to 79.6 micro-eV, with the center mass at the value of 78.582 (+5.0) micro-eV, our suggested most likely value for an axionic/ALP field mass, if these fields exist in nature. Our search strategy, as summarized herewith, is based upon the assumption that the dark matter that exists in the current epoch of our physical universe is dominated by axions and thus the local observable axion density is the density of the invisible light cold dark matter, permeating our local neighborhood (mainly in the Milky Way galactic halo). Some ideas and the design of an experiment, built around a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Resonant Tunneling Diode in a resonant RF cavity, are also introduced in this report.</description>

      <title>Charming Darwin: the evolution of QCD parameters across different species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of measurements of spectral moments of inclusive charm decays with BESIII. The rich and uniquely clean data set of charm mesons and baryons at BESIII offers a unique laboratory to study the evolution of Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) parameters across different charm hadron species and to shed light on the interplay between heavy quark dynamics and light quark effects. The HQE in terms of inverse powers of the heavy meson mass is well-established in beauty decays, however due to the lighter charm mass its applicability to charm remains an open question. To date no determination of the HQE parameters, the kinetic energy, chromomagnetic moment and Darwin terms, has been attempted. A particular important role here is given to the Darwin and weak annihilation operators, whose values are important to predict lifetimes of heavy hadrons. Using a fast simulation for the BESIII detector response and predictions for spectral moments, we investigate the sensitivity to HQE parameters with today's and possible future data sets. In addition, we discuss the theory challenges for the HQE in charm and the experimental limitations. We further investigate the sensitivity of determining the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ with inclusive semileptonic charm decays.</description>

      <title>Jet Tagging with More-Interaction Particle Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08682v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the More-Interaction Particle Transformer (MIParT), a novel deep learning neural network designed for jet tagging. This framework incorporates our own design, the More-Interaction Attention (MIA) mechanism, which increases the dimensionality of particle interaction embeddings. We tested MIParT using the top tagging and quark-gluon datasets. Our results show that MIParT not only matches the accuracy and AUC of LorentzNet and a series of Lorentz-equivariant methods, but also significantly outperforms the ParT model in background rejection. Specifically, it improves background rejection by approximately 25% at a 30% signal efficiency on the top tagging dataset and by 3% on the quark-gluon dataset. Additionally, MIParT requires only 30% of the parameters and 53% of the computational complexity needed by ParT, proving that high performance can be achieved with reduced model complexity. For very large datasets, we double the dimension of particle embeddings, referring to this variant as MIParT-Large (MIParT-L). We find that MIParT-L can further capitalize on the knowledge from large datasets. From a model pre-trained on the 100M JetClass dataset, the background rejection performance of the fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by 39% on the top tagging dataset and by 6% on the quark-gluon dataset, surpassing that of the fine-tuned ParT. Specifically, the background rejection of fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by an additional 2% compared to the fine-tuned ParT. The results suggest that MIParT has the potential to advance efficiency benchmarks for jet tagging and event identification in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Accidental Suppression of Wilson Coefficients in Higgs Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higgs couplings are essential probes for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) since they can be modified by new physics, such as through the Higgs portal interaction $|H|^2\mathcal{O}$. These modifications influence Higgs interactions via dimension-6 operators of the form $ \left(\partial |H|^2\right)^2$ and $|H|^6$, which are generally expected to be of comparable size. This paper discusses a phenomenon of accidental suppression, where the $|H|^6$ coupling is significantly smaller than $\left(\partial |H|^2\right)^2$. This suppression, arising from the truncation of the tree-level effective potential, lacks a clear symmetry explanation but persists in portal models. This paper aims to inspire further studies on additional instances of accidental suppression without symmetry explanations or a general framework to characterize such suppression. We also discuss constraints, at the HL-LHC and future colliders, on the Wilson coefficients of the two dimension-6 operators for various benchmark scenarios of the concrete model.</description>

      <title>Double pole structures of $X_1(2900)$ as the $P$-wave $\bar{D}^*K^*$ resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal the double pole structures of the manifestly exotic tetraquark state $X_1(2900)$ in the scenario of $P$-wave $\bar{D}^*K^*$ dimeson resonance. We find that the observed enhancement signal associated with $X_1(2900)$ in $B^+ \to D^+D^-K^+$ by LHCb contains two $P$-wave poles denoted as $T_{cs1-}(2900)$ and $T^{\prime}_{cs1-}(2900)$, respectively. After considering the channel couplings among the $\bar{D}K$, $\bar{D}^*K$, $\bar{D}K^*$ and $\bar{D}^*K^*$ and the width of the $K^*$ meson, the masses and widths of the $S$-wave pole $T_{cs0+}(2900)$ and two $P$-wave poles $T_{cs1-}(2900)$ and $T^{\prime}_{cs1-}(2900)$ coincide with those of the $X_0(2900)$ and $X_1(2900)$ remarkably, which provides strong support for identifying $X_0(2900)$ and $X_1(2900)$ as $\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ dimeson states. Furthermore, we extensively calculate all $S$-wave and $P$-wave $\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ systems up to $J=3$ and predict four new isoscalar charmed-strange dimeson-type tetraquark states: an $S$-wave state $T_{cs1+}(2900)$ with quantum number $J^P=1^+$, three $P$-wave states $T_{cs1-}(2760)$ with $J^P=1^-$, $T_{cs0-}(2760)$ with $J^P=0^-$ and $T_{cs2-}(2900)$ with $J^P=2^-$. These near-threshold poles can be searched for at LHCb, Belle II and BESIII.</description>

      <title>Forward $\eta_Q$ production impact factor at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) coefficient function or impact factor for the hadroproduction of the state ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$ of a heavy quark-antiquark pair ($Q\bar{Q}$) at forward rapidities is computed at NLO in $\alpha_s$. This impact factor is an integral part of the resummation procedure for higher-order QCD corrections to the hadro-production cross sections of $\eta_c$ or $\eta_b$ mesons at forward rapidities in collinear factorisation (CF), enhanced by logarithms of partonic center of mass energy. The NLO computation, results of which are presented in this contribution, is an important step towards an extension of aforementioned resummation beyond the Leading Logarithmic Approximation(LLA).</description>

      <title>Improved background modeling for dark matter search with COSINE-100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COSINE-100 aims to conclusively test the claimed dark matter annual modulation signal detected by DAMA/LIBRA collaboration. DAMA/LIBRA has released updated analysis results by lowering the energy threshold to 0.75 keV through various upgrades. They have consistently claimed to have observed the annual modulation. In COSINE-100, it is crucial to lower the energy threshold for a direct comparison with DAMA/LIBRA, which also enhances the sensitivity of the search for low-mass dark matter, enabling COSINE-100 to explore this area. Therefore, it is essential to have a precise and quantitative understanding of the background spectrum across all energy ranges. This study expands the background modeling from 0.7 to 4000 keV using 2.82 years of COSINE-100 data. The modeling has been improved to describe the background spectrum across all energy ranges accurately. Assessments of the background spectrum are presented, considering the nonproportionality of NaI(Tl) crystals at both low and high energies and the characteristic X-rays produced by the interaction of external backgrounds with materials such as copper. Additionally, constraints on the fit parameters obtained from the alpha spectrum modeling fit are integrated into this model. These improvements are detailed in the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) allows a deep neural network (DNN) trained on one type of data to be adapted for new problems with limited information. We propose to use the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the physics of one process, and after fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the DNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after fine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions with nuclear targets ranging from lithium to iron. The method works even when the DNN is fine-tuned on a small dataset.</description>

      <title>MSHT Updates 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present various recent updates related to the MSHT20 PDF sets, and particularly to the MSHT20 approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) PDFs. These include an investigation of including either inclusive jet data or dijet data, the detailed treatment of $Z\,p_T$ data, and the impact on the gluon PDF in particular. We also very briefly summarize the determination of the strong coupling via an aN$^3$LO global PDF fit, finding $\alpha_S(M_Z^2)=0.1170\pm 0.0016$, and of including QED corrections in the aN$^3$LO analysis. Finally we consider the preliminary finding associated with the effect of improved knowledge of the N$^3$LO splitting functions on the aN$^3$LO PDFs. In particular we note a moderate impact on the gluon distribution, i.e. within the uncertainty, and a more limited impact on the gluon-gluon luminosity unless strong rapidity cuts are imposed. Hence, we conclude that while details of our aN$^3$LO PDFs will change with more precise splitting functions, only relatively minor effects on predictions are likely to result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel simulation of a strongly interacting dark sector also known as the Hidden Valley scenarios using angular ordered showers and the cluster hadronisation model in Herwig 7. We discuss the basics of this implementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the help of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector parameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study correlation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular structure of these events.

      <title>Constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings from its production and decay using the WW channel in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of the anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to vector bosons, including $CP$-violation effects, has been conducted using its production and decay in the WW channel. This analysis is performed on proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC during 2016-2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The different-flavor dilepton (e$\mu$) final state is analyzed, with dedicated categories targeting gluon fusion, electroweak vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson. Kinematic information from associated jets is combined using matrix element techniques to increase the sensitivity to anomalous effects at the production vertex. A simultaneous measurement of four Higgs boson couplings to electroweak vector bosons is performed in the framework of a standard model effective field theory. All measurements are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson and constraints are set on the fractional contribution of the anomalous couplings to the Higgs boson production cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is performed for localized excesses in the low-mass dijet invariant mass distribution, targeting a hypothetical new particle decaying into two jets and produced in association with either a high transverse momentum photon or a jet. The search uses the full Run 2 data sample from LHC proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during 2015-2018. Two variants of the search are presented for each type of initial-state radiation: one that makes no jet flavor requirements and one that requires both of the jets to have been identified as containing $b$-hadrons. No excess is observed relative to the Standard Model prediction, and the data are used to set upper limits on the production cross-section for a benchmark $Z'$ model and, separately, for generic, beyond the Standard Model scenarios which might produce a Gaussian-shaped contribution to dijet invariant mass distributions. The results extend the current constraints on dijet resonances to the mass range between 200 and 650 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for Higgs boson pair (HH) production with one Higgs boson decaying to two bottom quarks and the other to two W bosons are presented. The search is done using proton-proton collisions data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC from 2016 to 2018. The final states considered include at least one leptonically decaying W boson. No evidence for the presence of a signal is observed and corresponding upper limits on the HH production cross section are derived. The limit on the inclusive cross section of the nonresonant HH production, assuming that the distributions of kinematic observables are as expected in the standard model (SM), is observed (expected) to be 14 (18) times the value predicted by the SM, at 95% confidence level. The limits on the cross section are also presented as functions of various Higgs boson coupling modifiers, and anomalous Higgs boson coupling scenarios. In addition, limits are set on the resonant HH production via spin-0 and spin-2 resonances within the mass range 250-900 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Null results for WIMP dark matter have led to increased interest in exploring other dark matter candidates, such as Axions and Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), which also helps in answering the strong CP problem. This experiment achieved a sub-100 DRU (differential-rate-unit, expressed in counts/keV/kg/day) background in the MeV region of interest by employing a combination of active and passive veto techniques. Such a low background facilitates the search for ALPs with axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma \gamma} &gt; 10^{-6}$ and axion-electron coupling $10^{-8}&lt; g_{aee} &lt; 10^{-4}$ in the 1 keV to 10 MeV mass range. This indicates that the experiment has the capability to constrain the unexplored cosmological triangle in the ALP-photon parameter space for ALPs in the MeV mass range.</description>

      <title>Is infrared-collinear safe information all you need for jet classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based jet classifiers are able to achieve impressive tagging performance in a variety of applications in high-energy and nuclear physics. However, it remains unclear in many cases which aspects of jets give rise to this discriminating power, and whether jet observables that are tractable in perturbative QCD such as those obeying infrared-collinear (IRC) safety serve as sufficient inputs. In this article, we introduce a new classifier, Jet Flow Networks (JFNs), in an effort to address the question of whether IRC unsafe information provides additional discriminating power in jet classification. JFNs are permutation-invariant neural networks (deep sets) that take as input the kinematic information of reconstructed subjets. The subjet radius and a cut on the subjet's transverse momenta serve as tunable hyperparameters enabling a controllable sensitivity to soft emissions and nonperturbative effects. We demonstrate the performance of JFNs for quark vs. gluon and Z vs. QCD jet tagging. For small subjet radii and transverse momentum cuts, the performance of JFNs is equivalent to the IRC-unsafe Particle Flow Networks (PFNs), demonstrating that infrared-collinear unsafe information is not necessary to achieve strong discrimination for both cases. As the subjet radius is increased, the performance of the JFNs remains essentially unchanged until physical thresholds that we identify are crossed. For relatively large subjet radii, we show that the JFNs may offer an increased model independence with a modest tradeoff in performance compared to classifiers that use the full particle information of the jet. These results shed new light on how machines learn patterns in high-energy physics data</description>

      <title>Baryonium Dark Matter: Events with Circle Configurations in the Atmosphere and on the Surface of Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14933v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research supposes the parallel study of the manifestations of Baryonium Dark Matter (BDM) in astroparticle collisions in the atmosphere and among the footprints of the massive extraterrestrial objects that fall on the surface of Earth. These objects differ from stony asteroids and are seen as lightning and fulminating bolides. Since BDM is a QCD state, the characteristics of BDM disintegration events can be analyzed with the same model as hadroproproduction data on colliders. It was concluded that the HE event, which was detected in the stratosphere in 1975, differs from the collision of the nucleus. The signatures of such events are 1) the circle distribution of heavy secondary hadrons with almost nothing inside the ring and 2) the presence of heavy secondary particles with a mass out of range of known hadrons. The circle will also be the signature for heavy BDM conglomerates that disintegrate in the atmosphere for a few lower-mass BDMs. The same signatures should be seen in super-heavy BDM collapses on the Earth. The traces of such events are seen as circles of pits or shafts in the ground rock, which are organized in the circles. There are at least two pieces of evidence of such holes: cenotes on the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico) and pits in Durrington Walls (England). The vertical pits (or the wells), because sometimes they are filled with water, had been laid out in circles and have a depth of 5 - 50 meters. These super-heavy BDM collapses differ from the meteorite crash, because they do not form the craters. The existence of these places around the globe indicates the rare likelihood of meeting the super-massive BDM in proximity to Earth. The Tunguska meteorite could also be a BDM collapse. Finally, some suggestions are made about the emission of Baryonium Dark Matter with the jets from giant active Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH).</description>

      <title>Invisible and Semi-invisible Decays of Bottom Baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The similar densities of dark matter and baryons in the universe imply that they might arise from the same ultraviolet model. The B-Mesogenesis, which assumes dark matter is charged under the baryon number, attempts to simultaneously explain the origin of baryon asymmetry and dark matter in the universe. In particular, the B-Mesogenesis might induce bottom-baryon decays into invisible or semi-invisible final states, which provide a distinctive signal for probing this scenario. In this work, we systematically study the invisible decays of bottom baryons into dark matters, and semi-invisible decays of bottom baryons into a meson or a photon together with a dark matter particle. In particular, the fully invisible decay can explore the stable particles in B-Mesogenesis. Some QCD-based frameworks are used to calculate the hadronic matrix elements under the B-Mesogenesis model. We estimate the constraints on the Wilson coefficients or the product of some new physics couplings with the Wilson coefficients by the semi-invisible and invisible decays of bottom baryons at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Refined determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter of the electroweak theory of the standard model whose measurement in the low-energy regime is still not precisely determined. Different probes are sensitive to its value, among which atomic parity violation, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and parity-violating electron scattering on different nuclei. In this work, we attempt for the first time to combine all these various determinations by performing a global fit that also keeps into account the unavoidable dependence on the experimentally poorly known neutron distribution radius of the nuclei employed, for which a new measurement using proton-cesium elastic scattering became available. By using all present direct determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium we find $\sin^2\!\vartheta_{W} =0.2396^{+0.0020}_{-0.0019}$, which should supersede the previous value determined from atomic parity violation on cesium. When including electroweak only, but also indirect, determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium the uncertainty reduces to 0.0017 maintaining the same central value, showing an excellent agreement independently of the method used.</description>

      <title>Enforcing exact permutation and rotational symmetries in the application of quantum neural network on point cloud datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the field of quantum machine learning have promoted the idea of incorporating physical symmetries in the structure of quantum circuits. A crucial milestone in this area is the realization of $S_{n}$-permutation equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) that are equivariant under permutations of input objects. In this work, we focus on encoding the rotational symmetry of point cloud datasets into the QNN. The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products. We provide a novel structure of QNN that is exactly invariant to both rotations and permutations, with its efficacy demonstrated numerically in the problems of two-dimensional image classifications and identifying high-energy particle decays, produced by proton-proton collisions, with the $SO(1,3)$ Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Data Acquisition System of the LZ Dark Matter Detector: FADR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Data Acquisition System (DAQ) for the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter detector is described. The signals from 745 PMTs, distributed across three subsystems, are sampled with 100-MHz 32-channel digitizers (DDC-32s). A basic waveform analysis is carried out on the on-board Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to extract information about the observed scintillation and electroluminescence signals. This information is used to determine if the digitized waveforms should be preserved for offline analysis.
  The system is designed around the Kintex-7 FPGA. In addition to digitizing the PMT signals and providing basic event selection in real time, the flexibility provided by the use of FPGAs allows us to monitor the performance of the detector and the DAQ in parallel to normal data acquisition.
  The hardware and software/firmware of this FPGA-based Architecture for Data acquisition and Realtime monitoring (FADR) are discussed and performance measurements are described.</description>
