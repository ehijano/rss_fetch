      <title>Synchrony for weak coupling in the complexified Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the finite-size Kuramoto model analytically continued from real to complex variables and analyze its collective dynamics. For strong coupling, synchrony appears through locked states that constitute attractors, as for the real-variable system. However, synchrony persists in the form of \textit{complex locked states} for coupling strengths $K$ below the transition $K^{(\text{pl})}$ to classical \textit{phase locking}. Stable complex locked states indicate a locked sub-population of zero mean frequency in the real-variable model and their imaginary parts help identifying which units comprise that sub-population. We uncover a second transition at $K'&lt;K^{(\text{pl})}$ below which complex locked states become linearly unstable yet still exist for arbitrarily small coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Time Crystal in Driven-Dissipative Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous time crystals (CTCs) are characterized by sustained oscillations that break the time translation symmetry. Since the ruling out of equilibrium CTCs by no-go theorems, the emergence of such dynamical phases has been observed in various driven-dissipative quantum platforms. The current understanding of CTCs is mainly based on mean-field (MF) theories, which fail to address the problem of whether the long-range time crystalline order exists in noisy, spatially extended systems without the protection of all-to-all couplings. Here, we propose a new kind of CTC realized in a quantum contact model through self-organized bistability (SOB). The exotic CTCs stem from the interplay between collective dissipation induced by the first-order absorbing phase transitions (APTs) and slow constant driving provided by an incoherent pump. The stability of such oscillatory phases in finite dimensions under the action of intrinsic quantum fluctuations is scrutinized by the functional renormalization group method and numerical simulations. Occurring at the edge of quantum synchronization, the CTC phase exhibits an inherent period and amplitude with a coherence time diverging with system size, thus also constituting a boundary time crystal (BTC). Our results serve as a solid route towards self-protected CTCs in strongly interacting open systems.</description>
