      <title>Strategic Integration of AI Chatbots in Physics Teacher Preparation: A TPACK-SWOT Analysis of Pedagogical, Epistemic, and Cybersecurity Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the strategic and epistemically responsible integration of AI-powered chatbots into physics teacher education by employing a TPACK-guided SWOT framework across three structured learning activities. Conducted within a university-level capstone course on innovative tools for physics instruction, the activities targeted key intersections of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) through chatbot-assisted tasks: simplifying abstract physics concepts, constructing symbolic concept maps, and designing instructional scenarios. Drawing on participant reflections, classroom artifacts, and iterative feedback, the results highlight internal strengths such as enhanced information-seeking behavior, scaffolded pedagogical planning, and support for symbolic reasoning. At the same time, internal weaknesses emerged, including domain-specific inaccuracies, symbolic limitations (e.g., LaTeX misrendering), and risks of overreliance on AI outputs. External opportunities were found in promoting inclusive education, multilingual engagement, and expanded zones of proximal development (ZPD), while external threats included prompt injection risks, institutional access gaps, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. By extending existing TPACK-based models with constructs such as AI literacy, prompt-crafting competence, and epistemic verification protocols, this research offers a theoretically grounded and practically actionable roadmap for embedding AI in STEM teacher preparation. The findings affirm that, when critically scaffolded, AI chatbots can support metacognitive reflection, ethical reasoning, and instructional innovation in physics education if implementation is paired with digital fluency training and institutional support.</description>

      <title>Egocentric Mixed-Methods SNA: Analyzing Interviews with Women and/or LGBTQ+ Ph.D. Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network analysis (SNA) has been widely used in physics education research (PER) in recent years, but mostly in a limited range of the available modalities. This paper describes a unique approach to egocentric, mixed-methods SNA applied to qualitative network data obtained from 100 interviews with women and/or queer professional physicists. We focus on our methods for obtaining quantitative network data from these qualitative sources and present novel techniques for analysis of the networks. We also examine the ways in which egocentric and mixed-methods SNA techniques are aligned with critical methods and well-suited to the study of difference, non-normativity, and experiences of marginalization in physics spaces and communities. We explore the limitations and potential applications of these methods and situate this work in the larger context of our study of these interviews. This work bridges a methodological gap between SNA and qualitative work on identity in PER and begins to develop our understanding of the way gender and sexual minority physicists experience support.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Digital Divide: Small Language Models as a Pathway for Physics and Photonics Education in Underdeveloped Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limited infrastructure, scarce educational resources, and unreliable internet access often hinder physics and photonics education in underdeveloped regions. These barriers create deep inequities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. This article explores how Small Language Models (SLMs)-compact, AI-powered tools that can run offline on low-power devices, offering a scalable solution. By acting as virtual tutors, enabling native-language instruction, and supporting interactive learning, SLMs can help address the shortage of trained educators and laboratory access. By narrowing the digital divide through targeted investment in AI technologies, SLMs present a scalable and inclusive solution to advance STEM education and foster scientific empowerment in marginalized communities.</description>

      <title>SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19099v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.</description>
