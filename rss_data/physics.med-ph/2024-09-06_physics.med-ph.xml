      <title>Geometry of the cumulant series in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micrometer-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. The advent of precision medicine and quantitative imaging hinges on revealing the information content of dMRI, and providing its parsimonious basis- and hardware-independent "fingerprint". Here we reveal the geometry of a multi-dimensional dMRI signal, classify all 21 invariants of diffusion and covariance tensors in terms of irreducible representations of the group of rotations, and relate them to tissue properties. Previously studied dMRI contrasts are expressed via 7 invariants, while the remaining 14 provide novel complementary information. We design acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices guaranteeing minimal number of measurements to determine 3-4 most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for the whole brain. Representing dMRI signals via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of brain pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Collimator-Detector Response Compensation in High-Energy SPECT Imaging with 1D Convolutions and Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of the collimator-detector response (CDR) in SPECT reconstruction enables improved resolution and more accurate quantitation, especially for higher energy imaging (e.g.Lu-177 and Ac-225). Such modeling, however, can pose a significant computational bottleneck when there are substantial components of septal penetration and scatter in the acquired data, since a direct convolution-based approach requires large 2D kernels. The present work presents an alternative method for fast and accurate CDR compensation using a linear operator built from 1D convolutions and rotations (1D-R). To enable open-source development and use of these models in image reconstruction, we release a SPECTPSFToolbox repository for the PyTomography project on GitHub.</description>

      <title>TG-LMM: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation Accuracy through Text-Guided Large Multi-Modal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose TG-LMM (Text-Guided Large Multi-Modal Model), a novel approach that leverages textual descriptions of organs to enhance segmentation accuracy in medical images. Existing medical image segmentation methods face several challenges: current medical automatic segmentation models do not effectively utilize prior knowledge, such as descriptions of organ locations; previous text-visual models focus on identifying the target rather than improving the segmentation accuracy; prior models attempt to use prior knowledge to enhance accuracy but do not incorporate pre-trained models. To address these issues, TG-LMM integrates prior knowledge, specifically expert descriptions of the spatial locations of organs, into the segmentation process. Our model utilizes pre-trained image and text encoders to reduce the number of training parameters and accelerate the training process. Additionally, we designed a comprehensive image-text information fusion structure to ensure thorough integration of the two modalities of data. We evaluated TG-LMM on three authoritative medical image datasets, encompassing the segmentation of various parts of the human body. Our method demonstrated superior performance compared to existing approaches, such as MedSAM, SAM and nnUnet.</description>

      <title>Deep Brain Ultrasound Ablation Thermal Dose Modeling with in Vivo Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intracorporeal needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU) is a minimally invasive option for intervening in malignant brain tumors, commonly used in thermal ablation procedures. This technique is suitable for both primary and metastatic cancers, utilizing a high-frequency alternating electric field (up to 10 MHz) to excite a piezoelectric transducer. The resulting rapid deformation of the transducer produces an acoustic wave that propagates through tissue, leading to localized high-temperature heating at the target tumor site and inducing rapid cell death. To optimize the design of NBTU transducers for thermal dose delivery during treatment, numerical modeling of the acoustic pressure field generated by the deforming piezoelectric transducer is frequently employed. The bioheat transfer process generated by the input pressure field is used to track the thermal propagation of the applicator over time. Magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI) can be used to experimentally validate these models. Validation results using MRTI demonstrated the feasibility of this model, showing a consistent thermal propagation pattern. However, a thermal damage isodose map is more advantageous for evaluating therapeutic efficacy. To achieve a more accurate simulation based on the actual brain tissue environment, a new finite element method (FEM) simulation with enhanced damage evaluation capabilities was conducted. The results showed that the highest temperature and ablated volume differed between experimental and simulation results by 2.1884{\deg}C (3.71%) and 0.0631 cm$^3$ (5.74%), respectively. The lowest Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for peak temperature was 0.7117, and the lowest Dice coefficient for the ablated area was 0.7021, indicating a good agreement in accuracy between simulation and experiment.</description>

      <title>Focal Volume, Acoustic Radiation Force, and Strain in Two-Transducer Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) holds promise for non-invasive neural modulation in treating neurological disorders. Most clinically relevant targets are deep within the brain (near or at its geometric center), surrounded by other sensitive regions that need to be spared clinical intervention. However, in TUS, increasing frequency with the goal of improving spatial resolution reduces the effective penetration depth. We show that by using a pair of 1 MHz, orthogonally arranged transducers we improve the spatial resolution afforded by each of the transducers individually, by nearly 40 fold, achieving a sub-cubic millimeter target volume of $0.24\ mm^3$. We show that orthogonally placed transducers generate highly localized standing waves with Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF) arranged into periodic regions of compression and tension near the target. We further present an extended capability of the orthogonal setup, which is to impart selective pressures--either positive or negative, but not both--on the target. Lastly, we share our preliminary findings that strain can arise from both particle motion and ARF with the former reaching its maximum value at the focus, and the latter remaining null at the focus and reaching its maximum around the focus.
  As the field is investigating the mechanism of interaction in TUS by way of elucidating the mapping between ultrasound parameters and neural response, orthogonal transducers expand our toolbox by making it possible to conduct these investigations at much finer spatial resolutions, with localized and directed (compression vs. tension) ARF and the capability of applying selective pressures at the target.</description>
