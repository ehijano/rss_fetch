      <title>Visually Guided Swarm Motion Coordination via Insect-inspired Small Target Motion Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress developing experimentally-consistent models of insect in-flight sensing and feedback for individual agents, a lack of systematic understanding of the multi-agent and group performance of the resulting bio-inspired sensing and feedback approaches remains a barrier to robotic swarm implementations. This study introduces the small-target motion reactive (STMR) swarming approach by designing a concise engineering model of the small target motion detector (STMD) neurons found in insect lobula complexes. The STMD neuron model identifies the bearing angle at which peak optic flow magnitude occurs, and this angle is used to design an output feedback switched control system. A theoretical stability analysis provides bi-agent stability and state boundedness in group contexts. The approach is simulated and implemented on ground vehicles for validation and behavioral studies. The results indicate despite having the lowest connectivity of contemporary approaches (each agent instantaneously regards only a single neighbor), collective group motion can be achieved. STMR group level metric analysis also highlights continuously varying polarization and decreasing heading variance.</description>

      <title>Communication-efficient and Differentially-private Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Linear Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributed computation of a Nash equilibrium (NE) for non-cooperative games is gaining increased attention recently. Due to the nature of distributed systems, privacy and communication efficiency are two critical concerns. Traditional approaches often address these critical concerns in isolation. This work introduces a unified framework, named CDP-NES, designed to improve communication efficiency in the privacy-preserving NE seeking algorithm for distributed non-cooperative games over directed graphs. Leveraging both general compression operators and the noise adding mechanism, CDP-NES perturbs local states with Laplacian noise and applies difference compression prior to their exchange among neighbors. We prove that CDP-NES not only achieves linear convergence to a neighborhood of the NE in games with restricted monotone mappings but also guarantees $\epsilon$-differential privacy, addressing privacy and communication efficiency simultaneously. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A leadless power transfer and wireless telemetry solutions for an endovascular electrocorticography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endovascular brain-computer interfaces (eBCIs) offer a minimally invasive way to connect the brain to external devices, merging neuroscience, engineering, and medical technology. Achieving wireless data and power transmission is crucial for the clinical viability of these implantable devices. Typically, solutions for endovascular electrocorticography (ECoG) include a sensing stent with multiple electrodes (e.g. in the superior sagittal sinus) in the brain, a subcutaneous chest implant for wireless energy harvesting and data telemetry, and a long (tens of centimetres) cable with a set of wires in between. This long cable presents risks and limitations, especially for younger patients or those with fragile vasculature. This work introduces a wireless and leadless telemetry and power transfer solution for endovascular ECoG. The proposed solution includes an optical telemetry module and a focused ultrasound (FUS) power transfer system. The proposed system can be miniaturised to fit in an endovascular stent. Our solution uses optical telemetry for high-speed data transmission (over 2 Mbit/s, capable of transmitting 41 ECoG channels at a 2 kHz sampling rate and 24-bit resolution) and the proposed power transferring scheme provides up to 10mW power budget into the site of the endovascular implants under the safety limit. Tests on bovine tissues confirmed the system's effectiveness, suggesting that future custom circuit designs could further enhance eBCI applications by removing wires and auxiliary implants, minimising complications.</description>

      <title>Stability And Uncertainty Propagation In Power Networks: A Lyapunov-based Approach With Applications To Renewable Resources Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy resources (RER) introduces challenging issues related to power system stability. Interestingly, identifying grid nodes that can best support stochastic loads from RER, has gained recent interest. Methods based on Lyapunov stability are commonly exploited to assess the stability of power networks. These strategies approach quantifying system stability while considering: (i) simplified reduced order power system models that do not model power flow constraints, or (ii) datadriven methods that are prone to measurement noise and hence can inaccurately depict stochastic loads as system instability. In this paper, while considering a nonlinear differential algebraic equation (NL-DAE) model, we introduce a new method for assessing the impact of uncertain renewable power injections on the stability of power system nodes/buses. The identification of stable nodes informs the operator/utility on how renewables injections affect the stability of the grid. The proposed method is based on optimizing metrics equivalent to the Lyapunov spectrum of exponents; its underlying properties result in a computationally efficient and scalable stable node identification algorithm for renewable energy resources allocation. The proposed method is validated on the IEEE 9-bus and 200-bus networks</description>

      <title>Functional Specifications and Testing Requirements of Grid-Forming Type-IV Offshore Wind Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout the past few years, various transmission system operators (TSOs) and research institutes have defined several functional specifications for grid-forming (GFM) converters via grid codes, white papers, and technical documents. These institutes and organisations also proposed testing requirements for general inverter-based resources (IBRs) and specific GFM converters. This paper initially reviews functional specifications and testing requirements from several sources to create an understanding of GFM capabilities in general. Furthermore, it proposes an outlook of the defined GFM capabilities, functional specifications, and testing requirements for offshore wind power plant (OF WPP) applications from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) perspective. Finally, this paper briefly establishes the relevance of new testing methodologies for equipment-level certification and model validation, focusing on GFM functional specifications.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity Conditions for Maximum Dynamic Loadability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a possibility of stabilizing very fast electromagnetic interactions between Inverter Based Resources (IBRs), known as the Control Induced System Stability problems. We propose that when these oscillatory interactions are controlled the ability of the grid to deliver power to loads at high rates will be greatly increased. We refer to this grid property as the dynamic grid loadability. The approach is to start by modeling the dynamical behavior of all components. Next, to avoid excessive complexity, interactions between components are captured in terms of unified technology-agnostic aggregate variables, instantaneous power and rate of change of instantaneous reactive power. Sufficient dissipativity conditions in terms of rate of change of energy conversion in components themselves and bounds on their rate of change of interactions are derived in support of achieving the maximum system loadability. These physically intuitive conditions are then used to derive methods to increase loadability using high switching frequency reactive power sources. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical calculations, and shows dynamic load-side reactive power support increases stable dynamic loadability regions.</description>

      <title>RACH Traffic Prediction in Massive Machine Type Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic pattern prediction has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently managing and mitigating the impacts of event-driven bursty traffic in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. However, achieving accurate predictions of bursty traffic remains a non-trivial task due to the inherent randomness of events, and these challenges intensify within live network environments. Consequently, there is a compelling imperative to design a lightweight and agile framework capable of assimilating continuously collected data from the network and accurately forecasting bursty traffic in mMTC networks. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a machine learning-based framework tailored for forecasting bursty traffic in multi-channel slotted ALOHA networks. The proposed machine learning network comprises long-term short-term memory (LSTM) and a DenseNet with feed-forward neural network (FFNN) layers, where the residual connections enhance the training ability of the machine learning network in capturing complicated patterns. Furthermore, we develop a new low-complexity online prediction algorithm that updates the states of the LSTM network by leveraging frequently collected data from the mMTC network. Simulation results and complexity analysis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of both accuracy and complexity, making it well-suited for time-critical live scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in a network with a single base station and thousands of devices organized into groups with distinct traffic-generating characteristics. Comprehensive evaluations and simulations indicate that our proposed machine learning approach achieves a remarkable $52\%$ higher accuracy in long-term predictions compared to traditional methods, without imposing additional processing load on the system.</description>

      <title>Stability and Performance Analysis of Discrete-Time ReLU Recurrent Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents sufficient conditions for the stability and $\ell_2$-gain performance of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with ReLU activation functions. These conditions are derived by combining Lyapunov/dissipativity theory with Quadratic Constraints (QCs) satisfied by repeated ReLUs. We write a general class of QCs for repeated RELUs using known properties for the scalar ReLU. Our stability and performance condition uses these QCs along with a "lifted" representation for the ReLU RNN. We show that the positive homogeneity property satisfied by a scalar ReLU does not expand the class of QCs for the repeated ReLU. We present examples to demonstrate the stability / performance condition and study the effect of the lifting horizon.</description>

      <title>Cellular Traffic Prediction Using Online Prediction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 5G technology promises a paradigm shift in the realm of telecommunications, offering unprecedented speeds and connectivity. However, the efficient management of traffic in 5G networks remains a critical challenge. It is due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of network traffic, varying user behaviors, extended network size, and diverse applications, all of which demand highly accurate and adaptable prediction models to optimize network resource allocation and management. This paper investigates the efficacy of live prediction algorithms for forecasting cellular network traffic in real-time scenarios. We apply two live prediction algorithms on machine learning models, one of which is recently proposed Fast LiveStream Prediction (FLSP) algorithm. We examine the performance of these algorithms under two distinct data gathering methodologies: synchronous, where all network cells report statistics simultaneously, and asynchronous, where reporting occurs across consecutive time slots. Our study delves into the impact of these gathering scenarios on the predictive performance of traffic models. Our study reveals that the FLSP algorithm can halve the required bandwidth for asynchronous data reporting compared to conventional online prediction algorithms, while simultaneously enhancing prediction accuracy and reducing processing load. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of algorithmic complexity and memory requirements across various machine learning models. Through empirical evaluation, we provide insights into the trade-offs inherent in different prediction strategies, offering valuable guidance for network optimization and resource allocation in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>ATDM:An Anthropomorphic Aerial Tendon-driven Manipulator with Low-Inertia and High-Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial Manipulator Systems (AMS) have garnered significant interest for their utility in aerial operations. Nonetheless, challenges related to the manipulator's limited stiffness and the coupling disturbance with manipulator movement persist. This paper introduces the Aerial Tendon-Driven Manipulator (ATDM), an innovative AMS that integrates a hexrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) anthropomorphic tendon-driven manipulator. The design of the manipulator is anatomically inspired, emulating the human arm anatomy from the shoulder joint downward. To enhance the structural integrity and performance, finite element topology optimization and lattice optimization are employed on the links to replicate the radially graded structure characteristic of bone, this approach effectively reduces weight and inertia while simultaneously maximizing stiffness. A novel tensioning mechanism with adjustable tension is introduced to address cable relaxation, and a Tension-amplification tendon mechanism is implemented to increase the manipulator's overall stiffness and output. The paper presents a kinematic model based on virtual coupled joints, a comprehensive workspace analysis, and detailed calculations of output torques and stiffness for individual arm joints.
  The prototype arm has a total weight of 2.7 kg, with the end effector contributing only 0.818 kg. By positioning all actuators at the base, coupling disturbance are minimized. The paper includes a detailed mechanical design and validates the system's performance through semi-physical multi-body dynamics simulations, confirming the efficacy of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Data Integrity and Traceability in Industry Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS) through Blockchain Technology: A Comprehensive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology, heralded as a transformative innovation, has far-reaching implications beyond its initial application in cryptocurrencies. This study explores the potential of blockchain in enhancing data integrity and traceability within Industry Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), a crucial aspect in the era of Industry 4.0. ICPS, integrating computational and physical components, is pivotal in managing critical infrastructure like manufacturing, power grids, and transportation networks. However, they face challenges in security, privacy, and reliability. With its inherent immutability, transparency, and distributed consensus, blockchain presents a groundbreaking approach to address these challenges. It ensures robust data reliability and traceability across ICPS, enhancing transaction transparency and facilitating secure data sharing. This research unearths various blockchain applications in ICPS, including supply chain management, quality control, contract management, and data sharing. Each application demonstrates blockchain's capacity to streamline processes, reduce fraud, and enhance system efficiency. In supply chain management, blockchain provides real-time auditing and compliance. For quality control, it establishes tamper-proof records, boosting consumer confidence. In contract management, smart contracts automate execution, enhancing efficiency. Blockchain also fosters secure collaboration in ICPS, which is crucial for system stability and safety. This study emphasizes the need for further research on blockchain's practical implementation in ICPS, focusing on challenges like scalability, system integration, and security vulnerabilities. It also suggests examining blockchain's economic and organizational impacts in ICPS to understand its feasibility and long-term advantages.</description>

      <title>Leveraging AES Padding: dBs for Nothing and FEC for Free in IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a significant advancement in digital technology, with its rapidly growing network of interconnected devices. This expansion, however, brings forth critical challenges in data security and reliability, especially under the threat of increasing cyber vulnerabilities. Addressing the security concerns, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is commonly employed for secure encryption in IoT systems. Our study explores an innovative use of AES, by repurposing AES padding bits for error correction and thus introducing a dual-functional method that seamlessly integrates error-correcting capabilities into the standard encryption process. The integration of the state-of-the-art Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoder (GRAND) in the receiver's architecture facilitates the joint decoding and decryption process. This strategic approach not only preserves the existing structure of the transmitter but also significantly enhances communication reliability in noisy environments, achieving a notable over 3 dB gain in Block Error Rate (BLER). Remarkably, this enhanced performance comes with a minimal power overhead at the receiver - less than 15% compared to the traditional decryption-only process, underscoring the efficiency of our hardware design for IoT applications. This paper discusses a comprehensive analysis of our approach, particularly in energy efficiency and system performance, presenting a novel and practical solution for reliable IoT communications.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Motor Actuator for Ceiling Robots with High Force and High Speed Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patient transfer devices allow to move patients passively in hospitals and care centers. Instead of hoisting the patient, it would be beneficial in some cases to assist their movement, enabling them to move by themselves. However, patient assistance requires devices capable of precisely controlling output forces at significantly higher speeds than those used for patient transfers alone, and a single motor solution would be over-sized and show poor efficiency to do both functions. This paper presents a dual-motor actuator and control schemes adapted for a patient mobility equipment that can be used to transfer patients, assist patient in their movement, and help prevent falls. The prototype is shown to be able to lift patients weighing up to 318 kg, to assist a patient with a desired force of up to 100 kg with a precision of 7.8%. Also, a smart control scheme to manage falls is shown to be able to stop a patient who is falling by applying a desired deceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the routing problem for self-interested vehicles using stochastic decision strategies. By approximating the road latency functions and a non-linear variable transformation, we frame the problem as an aggregative game. We characterize the approximation error and we derive a new monotonicity condition for a broad category of games that encompasses the problem under consideration. Next, we propose a semi-decentralized algorithm to calculate the routing as a variational generalized Nash equilibrium and demonstrate the solution's benefits with numerical simulations. In the particular case of potential games, which emerges for linear latency functions, we explore a receding-horizon formulation of the routing problem, showing asymptotic convergence to destinations and analysing closed-loop performance dependence on horizon length through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Stability Analysis for Repeated LVRT Process of Wind Turbine Based on Switched System Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significant electrical distance between wind power collection points and the main grid poses challenges for weak grid-connected wind power systems. A new type of voltage oscillation phenomenon induced by repeated low voltage ride-through (LVRT) of the wind turbine has been observed, threatening the safe and stable operation of such power systems. Therefore, exploring dynamic evolution mechanisms and developing stability analysis approaches for this phenomenon have become pressing imperatives. This paper introduces switched system theory for dynamic modeling, mechanism elucidation, and stability analysis of the repeated LVRT process. Firstly, considering the external connection impedance and internal control dynamics, a novel wind turbine grid-side converter (WT-GSC) switched system model is established to quantitatively characterize the evolution dynamic and mechanism of the voltage oscillation. Subsequently, a sufficient stability criterion and index grounded in the common Lyapunov function are proposed for stability analysis and assessment of the WT-GSC switched system. Moreover, to enhance the system stability, the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis method is adopted to identify dominant parameters, which can be further optimized via the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Finally, simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus test system verify the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic modeling and stability analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Aggregator of Electric Vehicles Bidding in Nordic FCR-D Markets: A Chance-Constrained Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two new innovative regulations in the Nordic ancillary service markets, the P90 rule and LER classification, were introduced to make the market more attractive for flexible stochastic resources. The regulations respectively relax market requirements related to the security and volume of flexible capacity from such resources. However, this incentivizes aggregators to exploit the rules when bidding flexible capacity. Considering the Nordic ancillary service Frequency Containment Reserve - Disturbance (FCR-D), we consider an aggregator with a portfolio of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using real-life data and present an optimization model that, new to the literature, uses Joint Chance-Constraints (JCCs) for bidding its flexible capacity while adhering to the new market regulations. Using different bundle sizes within the portfolio and the approximation methods of the JCCs, ALSO-X and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), we show that a significant synergy effect emerges when aggregating a portfolio of EVs, especially when applying ALSO-X which exploits the rules more than CVaR. We show that EV owners can earn a significant profit when participating in the aggregator portfolio.</description>

      <title>Distributed Dissipativity-Based Controller and Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new distributed control approach for the voltage regulation problem in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of interconnected distributed generators (DGs), distribution lines, and loads. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG with a distributed controller as a networked system in which the DGs and lines are two subsystems interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This matrix demonstrates the distributed controller gains as well as the communication topology of DC MG. To design the distributed controller gains, we use the dissipative properties of the subsystems and formulate a global linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of global control design, we propose a local controller for each DG and line subsystem by formulating a local LMI problem. In contrast to existing controllers that segregate communication topology and controller gains, our proposed controller simultaneously designs both communication topology and distributed controllers. The proposed controller is also compositional, meaning that when a new subsystem is added to or removed from networked systems, the controller for the new subsystem is designed solely based on the dynamics of the new subsystem and the dissipativity information of its coupled subsystems. This ensures that the overall system remains stable during plug-and-play (PnP) operation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Prosumer Policies in Periodic Double Auctions Inspired by Equilibrium Analysis (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a periodic double auction (PDA) wherein the main participants are wholesale suppliers and brokers representing retailers. The suppliers are represented by a composite supply curve and the brokers are represented by individual bids. Additionally, the brokers can participate in small-scale selling by placing individual asks; hence, they act as prosumers. Specifically, in a PDA, the prosumers who are net buyers have multiple opportunities to buy or sell multiple units of a commodity with the aim of minimizing the cost of buying across multiple rounds of the PDA. Formulating optimal bidding strategies for such a PDA setting involves planning across current and future rounds while considering the bidding strategies of other agents. In this work, we propose Markov perfect Nash equilibrium (MPNE) policies for a setup where multiple prosumers with knowledge of the composite supply curve compete to procure commodities. Thereafter, the MPNE policies are used to develop an algorithm called MPNE-BBS for the case wherein the prosumers need to re-construct an approximate composite supply curve using past auction information. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the PowerTAC wholesale market simulator against several baselines and state-of-the-art bidding policies.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.</description>

      <title>TinyMPC: Model-Predictive Control on Resource-Constrained Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling highly dynamic robotic systems subject to complex constraints. However, MPC is computationally demanding, and is often impractical to implement on small, resource-constrained robotic platforms. We present TinyMPC, a high-speed MPC solver with a low memory footprint targeting the microcontrollers common on small robots. Our approach is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and leverages the structure of the MPC problem for efficiency. We demonstrate TinyMPC's effectiveness by benchmarking against the state-of-the-art solver OSQP, achieving nearly an order of magnitude speed increase, as well as through hardware experiments on a 27 gram quadrotor, demonstrating high-speed trajectory tracking and dynamic obstacle avoidance. TinyMPC is publicly available at https://tinympc.org.</description>

      <title>Qplacer: Frequency-Aware Component Placement for Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers face a critical limitation in qubit numbers, hindering their progression towards large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum computing. A significant challenge impeding scaling is crosstalk, characterized by unwanted interactions among neighboring components on quantum chips, including qubits, resonators, and substrate. We motivate a general approach to systematically resolving multifaceted crosstalks in a limited substrate area. We propose Qplacer, a frequency-aware electrostatic-based placement framework tailored for superconducting quantum computers, to alleviate crosstalk by isolating these components in spatial and frequency domains alongside compact substrate design. Qplacer commences with a frequency assigner that ensures frequency domain isolation for qubits and resonators. It then incorporates a padding strategy and resonator partitioning for layout flexibility. Central to our approach is the conceptualization of quantum components as charged particles, enabling strategic spatial isolation through a 'frequency repulsive force' concept. Our results demonstrate that Qplacer carefully crafts the physical component layout in mitigating various crosstalk impacts while maintaining a compact substrate size. On various device topologies and NISQ benchmarks, Qplacer improves fidelity by an average of 36.7x and reduces spatial violations (susceptible to crosstalk) by an average of 12.76x, compared to classical placement engines. Regarding area optimization, compared to manual designs, Qplacer can reduce the required layout area by 2.14x on average</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new computer-controlled weaving technology that enables the fabrication of woven structures in the shape of given 3D surfaces by using threads in non-traditional materials with high bending-stiffness, allowing for multiple applications with the resultant woven fabrics. A new weaving machine and a new manufacturing process are developed to realize the function of 3D surface weaving by the principle of short-row shaping. A computational solution is investigated to convert input 3D freeform surfaces into the corresponding weaving operations (indicated as W-code) to guide the operation of this system. A variety of examples using cotton threads, conductive threads and optical fibres are fabricated by our prototype system to demonstrate its functionality.</description>

      <title>Composite Distributed Learning and Synchronization of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems with Complete Uncertain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of composite synchronization and learning control in a network of multi-agent robotic manipulator systems with heterogeneous nonlinear uncertainties under a leader-follower framework. A novel two-layer distributed adaptive learning control strategy is introduced, comprising a first-layer distributed cooperative estimator and a second-layer decentralized deterministic learning controller. The first layer is to facilitate each robotic agent's estimation of the leader's information. The second layer is responsible for both controlling individual robot agents to track desired reference trajectories and accurately identifying/learning their nonlinear uncertain dynamics. The proposed distributed learning control scheme represents an advancement in the existing literature due to its ability to manage robotic agents with completely uncertain dynamics including uncertain mass matrices. This allows the robotic control to be environment-independent which can be used in various settings, from underwater to space where identifying system dynamics parameters is challenging. The stability and parameter convergence of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Smooth Computation without Input Delay: Robust Tube-Based Model Predictive Control for Robot Manipulator Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has exhibited remarkable capabilities in optimizing objectives and meeting constraints. However, the substantial computational burden associated with solving the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) at each triggering instant introduces significant delays between state sampling and control application. These delays limit the practicality of MPC in resource-constrained systems when engaging in complex tasks. The intuition to address this issue in this paper is that by predicting the successor state, the controller can solve the OCP one time step ahead of time thus avoiding the delay of the next action. To this end, we compute deviations between real and nominal system states, predicting forthcoming real states as initial conditions for the imminent OCP solution. Anticipatory computation stores optimal control based on current nominal states, thus mitigating the delay effects. Additionally, we establish an upper bound for linearization error, effectively linearizing the nonlinear system, reducing OCP complexity, and enhancing response speed. We provide empirical validation through two numerical simulations and corresponding real-world robot tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements and augmented response speed (up to $90\%$) resulting from the seamless integration of our proposed approach compared to conventional time-triggered MPC strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid feedback control scheme for the autonomous robot navigation problem in three-dimensional environments with arbitrarily-shaped convex obstacles. The proposed hybrid control strategy, which consists in switching between the move-to-target mode and the obstacle-avoidance mode, guarantees global asymptotic stability of the target location in the obstacle-free workspace. We also provide a procedure for the implementation of the proposed hybrid controller in a priori unknown environments and validate its effectiveness through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Symmetry in Dynamics for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Asymmetric Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has leveraged symmetries in the model to improve sample efficiency in training a policy. A commonly used simplifying assumption is that the dynamics and reward both exhibit the same symmetry. However, in many real-world environments, the dynamical model exhibits symmetry independent of the reward model: the reward may not satisfy the same symmetries as the dynamics. In this paper, we investigate scenarios where only the dynamics are assumed to exhibit symmetry, extending the scope of problems in reinforcement learning and learning in control theory where symmetry techniques can be applied. We use Cartan's moving frame method to introduce a technique for learning dynamics which, by construction, exhibit specified symmetries. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the proposed method learns a more accurate dynamical model.</description>

      <title>Rapid nonlinear convex guidance using a monomial method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework by which the nonlinear trajectory optimization problem is posed as a path-planning problem in a space liberated of dynamics. In this space, general state constraints for continuous and impulsive control problems are encoded as linear constraints on the native overparameterized variables. This framework is enabled by nonlinear expansion in the vicinity of a reference in terms of fundamental solutions and a minimal nonlinear basis of mixed monomials in problem initial conditions. The former can be computed using state transition tensors, differential algebra, or analytic approaches, and the latter is computed analytically. Nonlinear guidance schemes are proposed taking advantage of this framework, including a successive convex programming scheme for delta-V minimizing trajectory optimization. This work enables a stable, easy to implement, and highly rapid nonlinear guidance implementation without the need for collocation or real-time integration.</description>
