      <title>Notes on Divisibility of Catalan Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the divisibility properties of \sigma(C_n), the sum-of-divisors function applied to Catalan numbers, in relation to other number-theoretic functions. We establish conditions under which C_n has prime factors of the form 6k-1, derive sufficient criteria for divisibility of \sigma(C_n), and explore asymptotic estimates for the growth of \sigma(C_n) using de Bruijn's theorem. These results provide new insights into the arithmetic structure of Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Lollipops, dense cycles and chords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $k\geq 2$ contains a cycle $C$ that is dense in several respects. First, it has at least $k+1$ vertices each having at least $k$ neighbors in $C$ (so $C$ has at least $\frac{(k+1)(k-2)}{2}$ chords). The inequality is tight and provides a sharp upper bound for the chromatic number of graphs where all cycles have less than $\ell$ chords for all $\ell \geq 0$. Then, we show that some edges of $C$ can be contracted to obtain a graph with high minimum degree (we call such a minor of $C$ a \emph{cyclic minor}). We then investigate further cycles having cliques as cyclic minors, and show that minimum degree at least $O(k^2)$ guarantees a cyclic $K_k$-minor.</description>

      <title>Explorations on the number of realizations of minimally rigid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigid graphs have only finitely many realizations. In the recent years significant progress was made in computing the number of such realizations. With this progress it was also possible for the first time to do computations on large sets of graphs. In this paper we show what we can conclude from the data we got from these computations. This includes new lower bounds on the maximal realization count for a given number of vertices, upper bounds for the minimal realization count in higher dimensions and effects of rigidity preserving construction rules on the realization number. In all cases we give certificate graphs which prove the respective results.</description>

      <title>Multivalued forbidden numbers of two-rowed configurations -- the missing cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper considers extremal combinatorics questions in the language of matrices. An $s$-matrix is a matrix with entries in $\{0,1,\ldots, s-1\}$. An $s$-matrix is simple if it has no repeated columns. A matrix $F$ is a configuration in a matrix $A$, denoted $F\prec A$, if it is a row/column permutation of a submatrix of $A$. $\text{Avoid}(m,s,F)$ is the set of $m$-rowed, simple $s$-matrices not containing a configuration of $F$ and $\text{forb}(m,s, F)=\max\{|A|\colon A \in \text{Avoid}(m,s,F)\}$. Dillon and Sali initiated the systematic study of $\text{forb}(m,s, F)$ for $2$-matrices $F$, and computed $\text{forb}(m,s, F)$ for all 2-rowed $F$ when $s&gt;3$. In this paper we tackle the remaining cases when $s=3$. In particular, we determine the asymptotics of $\text{forb}(m,3,p\cdot K_2)-\text{forb}(m,3,p\cdot I_2)$ for $p&gt;3$, where $K_2$ is the $2\times 4$ simple $2$-matrix and $I_2$ is the $2\times 2$ identity matrix, as well as the exact values of $\text{forb}(m,3,F)$ for many 2-rowed $2$-matrices $F$.</description>

      <title>Embedding loose trees in $k$-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Koml\'os, S\'ark\"ozy and Szemer\'edi shows that every large $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $(1/2+\gamma)n$ contains all spanning trees of bounded degree. We generalised this result to loose spanning hypertrees in $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, linear hypergraphs obtained by subsequently adding edges sharing a single vertex with a previous edge.
  We give a general sufficient condition for embedding loose trees with bounded degree. In particular, we show that for all $k\ge 4$, every $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph with $n\ge n_0(k,\gamma, \Delta)$ and minimum $(k-2)$-degree at least $(1/2+\gamma)\binom{n}{k-2}$ contains every spanning loose tree with maximum vertex degree at most $\Delta$. This bound is asymptotically tight. This generalises a result of Pehova and Petrova, who proved the case when $k=3$ and of Pavez-Sign\'e, Sanhueza-Matamala and Stein, who considered the codegree threshold for bounded degree tight trees.</description>

      <title>On the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues of triangle-free strongly regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the seven known (non-degenerate) triangle-free strongly regular graphs, we prove that the Clebsch graph describes a matrix with exactly two distinct eigenvalues while five of the graphs do not. In showing that the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues of the Sims-Gewirtz graph is three, we answer a recently stated open question.</description>

      <title>Ramsey Theory on the Integer Grid: The "L" Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an $[n] \times [n]$ integer grid, a monochromatic $L$ is any set of points $\{(i, j), (i, j+t), (i+t, j+t)\}$ for some positive integer $t$, where $1 \leq i, j, i+t, j+t \leq n$. In this paper, we investigate the upper bound for the smallest integer $n$ such that a $3$-colored $n \times n$ grid is guaranteed to contain a monochromatic $L$. We use various methods, such as counting intervals on the main diagonal and using Golomb rulers, to improve the upper bound. This bound originally sat at 2593, and we improve it first to 1803, then to 1573, then to 772, and finally to 493. In the latter part of this paper, we discuss the lower bound and our attempts to improve it using SAT solvers.</description>

      <title>Some $q$-hypergeometric identities associated with partition theorems of Lebesgue, Schur and Capparelli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we establish a polynomial identity in three variables $a, b, c$, and with the degree of the polynomial given in terms of two integers $L, M$. By letting $L$ and $M$ tend to infinity, we get the 1993 Alladi-Gordon $q$-hypergeometric key-identity for the generalized Schur Theorem as well as the fundamental Lebesgue identity by two different choices of the variables. This polynomial identity provides a generalization and a unified approach to the Schur and Lebesgue theorems. We discuss other analytic identities for the Lebesgue and Schur theorems and also provide a key identity ($q$-hypergeometric) for Andrews' deep refinement of the Alladi-Schur theorem. Finally, we discuss a new infinite hierarchy of identities, the first three of which relate to the partition theorems of Euler, Lebesgue, and Capparelli, and provide their polynomial versions as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the matroidal mixed Eulerian numbers. We resolve a question posed by Berget, Spink, and Tseng, demonstrating that the invariant defined by matroidal mixed Eulerian numbers is precisely equivalent to Derksen's $\mathcal{G}$-invariant. As an application, we provide the first explicit, non-recursive formula for mixed Eulerian numbers. Our combinatorial approach draws inspiration from the classical work of Schubert and incorporates the cutting-edge contributions of Huh.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main result of this paper utilizes the representation graph of a group $G$, $R(V,G)$, and gives a general construction of a diagrammatic category $\mathbf{Dgrams}_{R(V,G)}$. The proof of the main theorem shows that, given explicit criteria, there is an equivalence of categories between a quotient category of $\mathbf{Dgrams}_{R(V,G)}$ and a full subcategory of $G-\textbf{mod}$ with objects being the tensor products of finitely many irreducible $G$-modules.</description>

      <title>Finest positroid subdivisions from maximal weakly separated collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cell decomposition of positive tropical Grassmannian $\rm Trop^+Gr_{k,n}$ following an approach by Early in \cite{Early2019FromWS}. Specifically, we deal with positroid subdivision of hypersimplex induced by translated blades from any maximal weakly separated collection. One of our main results gives a necessary and sufficient condition on a maximal weakly separated collection to form a positroid subdivision of a hypersimplex corresponding to a simplicial cone in $\rm Trop^+Gr_{k,n}$. For k = 2 our condition says that any weakly separated collection of two-elements sets gives such a simplicial cone, and all cones areof such a form. Then our second result shows that the maximality of any weakly separated collection is preserved under the boundary map, which affirmatively answers a question by Early in \cite{Early2019FromWS}. The main tool in proving this theorem is the plabic graph proposed by Postnikov \cite{postnikov2006totalpositivitygrassmanniansnetworks}. As a corollary, we find that all those positroid subdivisions are the finest. Thus, the flip of two maximal weakly separated collections corresponds to a pair of adjacent maximal cones in positive tropical Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity of Hierarchical Functions and Deep Learning Lower Bounds in General Product Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works explore deep learning's success by examining functions or data with hierarchical structure. Complementarily, research on gradient descent performance for deep nets has shown that noise sensitivity of functions under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli inputs establishes learning complexity bounds. This paper aims to bridge these research streams by demonstrating that functions constructed through repeated composition of non-linear functions are noise sensitive under general product measures.</description>

Abstract: We define a \textit{cap} in the affine geometry $AG(n,2)$ to be a subset in which any collection of 4 points is in general position. In this paper we classify, up to affine equivalence, all caps in $AG(n,2)$ of size $k \leq 9$. As a result, we obtain a complete characterization of caps in dimension $n \leq 6$, in particular complete and maximal caps. Since the \textit{EvenQuads} card deck is a model for $AG(6,2)$, as a consequence we determine the probability that an arbitrary $k$-card layout contains a quad.</description>

      <title>On the on-line coloring of unit interval graphs with proper interval representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05648v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the problem as a two-player game between Algorithm and Builder. The game is played in rounds. Each round, Builder presents an interval that is neither contained in nor contains any previously presented interval. Algorithm immediately and irrevocably assigns the interval a color that has not been assigned to any interval intersecting it. The set of intervals form an interval representation for a unit interval graph and the colors form a proper coloring of that graph. For every positive integer $\omega$, we define the value $R(\omega)$ as the maximum number of colors for which Builder has a strategy that forces Algorithm to use $R(\omega)$ colors with the restriction that the unit interval graph constructed cannot contain a clique of size $\omega$. In 1981, Chrobak and \'{S}lusarek showed that $R(\omega)\leq2\omega -1$. In 2005, Epstein and Levy showed that $R(\omega)\geq\lfloor{3\omega/2\rfloor}$. This problem remained unsolved for $\omega\geq 3$. In 2022, Bir\'o and Curbelo showed that $R(3)=5$. In this paper, we show that $R(4)=7$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider an old problem, namely the dimension of the $G$-invariant subspace in $V^{\otimes p} \otimes V^{*\otimes q}$, where $G$ is one of the classical groups ${\rm GL}(V)$, ${\rm SL}(V)$, ${\rm O}(V)$, ${\rm SO}(V)$, or ${\rm Sp}(V)$. Spanning sets for the invariant subspace have long been well known, but linear bases are more delicate. The main contribution of this paper is a combinatorial realization of linear bases via standard Young tableaux and arc diagrams, in a uniform manner for all five classical groups. As a secondary contribution, we survey the many equivalent ways -- some old, some new -- to enumerate the elements in these bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schubert polynomials are polynomial representatives of Schubert classes in the cohomology of the complete flag variety and have a combinatorial formulation in terms of bumpless pipe dreams. Quantum double Schubert polynomials are polynomial representatives of Schubert classes in the torus-equivariant quantum cohomology of the complete flag variety, but no analogous combinatorial formulation had been discovered. We introduce a generalization of the bumpless pipe dreams called quantum bumpless pipe dreams, giving a novel combinatorial formula for quantum double Schubert polynomials as a sum of binomial weights of quantum bumpless pipe dreams. We give a bijective proof for this formula by showing that the sum of binomial weights satisfies a defining transition equation.</description>

      <title>Tutte polynomials of matroids as universal valuative invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a full classification of all families of matroids that are closed under duality and minors, and for which the Tutte polynomial is a universal valuative invariant. There are four inclusion-wise maximal families, two of which are the class of elementary split matroids and the class of graphic Schubert matroids. As a consequence of our framework, we derive new relations among Tutte polynomials of matroids. For example, we show that the Tutte polynomial of every matroid can be expressed uniquely as an integral combination of Tutte polynomials of graphic Schubert matroids.</description>

      <title>Finding Permutiples of a Known Base and Multiplier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural numbers which are nontrivial multiples of some permutation of their base-$b$ digit representations are called permutiples. Specific cases include numbers which are multiples of cyclic permutations (cyclic numbers) and reversals of their digits (palintiples). Previous efforts have produced methods which construct new examples of permutiples with the same set of digits as a known example. Using simple graph-theoretical and finite-state machine constructions, we advance previous work by describing two methods for finding permutiples of a known base and multiplier with no need for known examples or prior knowledge of digits.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Graph Determination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20775v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of spectral graph determination is a fascinating area of research in spectral graph theory and algebraic combinatorics. This field focuses on examining the spectral characterization of various classes of graphs, developing methods to construct or distinguish cospectral nonisomorphic graphs, and analyzing the conditions under which a graph's spectrum uniquely determines its structure. This paper presents an overview of both classical and recent advancements in these topics, along with newly obtained proofs of some existing results, which offer additional insights.</description>

      <title>Refined enumeration of two-rowed set-valued standard tableaux via two-coloured Motzkin paths</title>

Abstract: We derive formulae for the number of set-valued standard tableaux of two-rowed shapes, keeping track of the total number of entries, the number of entries in the first row, and the number of entries in the second row. Key in the proofs is a bijection with two-coloured Motzkin paths followed by generating function computations and coefficient extraction helped by the Lagrange inversion formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{H}$. Let $S_{t,t,t}$ be the graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing each edge $t-1$ times, and let $W_{t\times t}$ be the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid. Let $\mathcal{L}_t$ be the family of all graphs $G$ such that $G$ is the line graph of some subdivision of $W_{t \times t}$. We prove that for every positive integer $t$ there exists $c(t)$ such that every $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t}, K_{t,t}\}$-free $n$-vertex graph admits a tree decomposition in which the maximum size of an independent set in each bag is at most $c(t)\log^4n$. This is a variant of a conjecture of Dallard, Krnc, Kwon, Milani\v{c}, Munaro, \v{S}torgel, and Wiederrecht from 2024. This implies that the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, as well as many other natural algorithmic problems, that are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t},K_{t,t}\}$-free. As part of our proof, we show that for every positive integer $t$ there exists an integer $d$ such that every $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t}\}$-free graph admits a balanced separator that is contained in the neighborhood of at most $d$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Average Mixing in Quantum Walks of Reversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Szegedy quantum walk is a discrete time quantum walk model which defines a quantum analogue of any Markov chain. The long-term behavior of the quantum walk can be encoded in a matrix called the average mixing matrix, whose columns give the limiting probability distribution of the walk given an initial state. We define a version of the average mixing matrix of the Szegedy quantum walk which allows us to more readily compare the limiting behavior to that of the chain it quantizes. We prove a formula for our mixing matrix in terms of the spectral decomposition of the Markov chain and show a relationship with the mixing matrix of a continuous quantum walk on the chain. In particular, we prove that average uniform mixing in the continuous walk implies average uniform mixing in the Szegedy walk. We conclude by giving examples of Markov chains of arbitrarily large size which admit average uniform mixing in both the continuous and Szegedy quantum walk.</description>

      <title>A Method for Finding All Permutiples with a Fixed Set of Digits from a Single Known Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number that is a nontrivial multiple of a permutation of its digits in some base. Special cases of permutiples include cyclic numbers (multiples of cyclic permutations of their digits) and palintiple numbers (multiples of their digit reversals). While cyclic numbers have a fairly straightforward description, palintiple numbers admit many varieties and cases. A previous paper attempts to get a better handle on the general case by constructing new examples of permutiples with the same set of digits, multiplier, and length as a known example. However, the results are not sufficient for finding all possible examples except when the multiplier divides the base. Using an approach based on the methods of this previous paper, we develop a new method which enables us to find all examples under any conditions.</description>

      <title>A linear-time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a randomized algorithm that, given a constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a proper $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring of an $m$-edge simple graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta \geq 1/\epsilon$ in $O(m)$ time with high probability. This is the first linear-time algorithm for this problem covering the full range of possible values of $\Delta$. Indeed, even for edge-coloring with $2\Delta - 1$ colors (i.e., meeting the "greedy" bound), no such linear-time algorithm has been previously known.</description>

      <title>Edge spectra of Gaussian random symmetric matrices with correlated entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the largest eigenvalue of a Gaussian random symmetric matrix $X_n$, with zero-mean, unit variance entries satisfying the condition $\sup_{(i, j) \ne (i', j')}|\mathbb{E}[X_{ij} X_{i'j'}]| = O(n^{-(1 + \varepsilon)})$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. It follows from Catalano et al. (2024) that the empirical spectral distribution of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges weakly almost surely to the standard semi-circle law. Using a F\"{u}redi-Koml\'{o}s-type high moment analysis, we show that the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} X_n)$ of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges almost surely to $2$. This result is essentially optimal in the sense that one cannot take $\varepsilon = 0$ and still obtain an almost sure limit of $2$. We also derive Gaussian fluctuation results for the largest eigenvalue in the case where the entries have a common non-zero mean. Let $Y_n = X_n + \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top$. When $\varepsilon \ge 1$ and $\lambda \gg n^{1/4}$, we show that \[
  n^{1/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sqrt{2} Z, \] where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian. On the other hand, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, we have $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j}X_{ij}) = O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$. Assuming that $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j} X_{ij}) = \sigma^2 n^{1 - \varepsilon} (1 + o(1))$, if $\lambda \gg n^{\varepsilon/4}$, then we have \[
  n^{\varepsilon/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sigma Z. \] While the ranges of $\lambda$ in these fluctuation results are certainly not optimal, a striking aspect is that different scalings are required in the two regimes $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$ and $\varepsilon \ge 1$.</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a natural partition function on a finite version of this model, and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition and correlation functions. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in various applications, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>
