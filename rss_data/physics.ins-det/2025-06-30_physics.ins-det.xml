      <title>CaloHadronic: a diffusion model for the generation of hadronic showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>The real-time data processing and acquisition system for Project 8 Phase II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Phase II of the Project 8 neutrino mass experiment, electrons from the decays of tritium or ${}^{83\mathrm{m}}$Kr are detected via their $\approx$26 GHz cyclotron radiation while contained within a circular waveguide. The signal from a given electron is characterized as a brief chirp, lasting $\lesssim$10 ms and changing in frequency by $\lesssim$1 MHz/ms. To detect these signals, the Project 8 collaboration developed a data acquisition (DAQ) system tailored to the signal properties. The DAQ is responsible for simultaneously selecting up to three 100 MHz-wide frequency windows to study, detect, and trigger on likely signals from different electron kinetic energies, and for writing the relevant data to disk. We describe the Phase II DAQ system in detail and address how the system was used for data-taking operations.</description>

      <title>Testing the quantum nature of gravity through interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13085v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Michelson-type interferometric protocol for testing the quantum nature of gravity through testing the phenomenology of semi-classical gravity theory, which predicts a state-dependent Schrodinger-Newton (SN) evolution of the test mass. The protocol's feature lies in utilizing the asymmetry of two interferometric arms induced by SN self-gravity to create cross-talk between the common and differential motion of the test masses. This cross-talk is imprinted as a clean binary signature in the correlation measurements of the interferometer's output light fields. Our results demonstrate that, when assisted by 10 dB squeezed input states, 3 hours of aggregated measurement data can provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to conclusively test the SN theory in 1 Kelvin environment. This shows the strong feasibility of using such interferometric protocols to test if gravity operates quantum-mechanically.</description>

      <title>Hardware acceleration for ultra-fast Neural Network training on FPGA for MRF map reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a fast quantitative MR Imaging technique that provides multi-parametric maps with a single acquisition. Neural Networks (NNs) accelerate reconstruction but require significant resources for training. We propose an FPGA-based NN for real-time brain parameter reconstruction from MRF data. Training the NN takes an estimated 200 seconds, significantly faster than standard CPU-based training, which can be up to 250 times slower. This method could enable real-time brain analysis on mobile devices, revolutionizing clinical decision-making and telemedicine.</description>

      <title>Multislice Hollow Ptychography for Simultaneous Atomic-Layer-Resolved 3D Structural Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Coincidence Time Resolution in a liquid xenon detector with silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the combination of liquid xenon as a scintillating medium and silicon photomultipliers as a readout in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for enhanced Time-Of-Flight resolution. We present the results of our first prototype optimized to maximize light collection using high-PDE, VUV-sensitive sensors and to minimize time fluctuations. We report a coincidence time resolution of 281 $\pm$ 2 ps FWHM, obtained using a $^{22}$Na calibration source. This result is competitive with the current state-of-the-art PET scanners and represents a significant step forward in the development of liquid xenon as a viable alternative to conventional scintillators in PET technology.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov detector with wavelength-shifting fiber readout for muon tomography applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cherenkov detectors have been extensively developed and utilized in various scientific fields, including particle physics, astrophysics, and nuclear engineering. These detectors operate based on Cherenkov radiation, which is emitted when a charged particle traverses a dielectric medium at a velocity greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium. In this work, we present the development of a Cherenkov radiation detector designed for a muon tomography system with high spatial resolution, employing wavelength-shifting (WLS) fiber readout. The detector consists of two large-area Cherenkov radiators, each measuring 1 m x 1 m, with each read out by WLS fibers arranged orthogonally to determine the x and y coordinates of muon hit positions. The system is modeled using the GEANT4 simulation package, and the achieved position resolution is is 1.8 mm+-0.1 (FWHM). The detector is inherently insensitive to natural background radiation and exhibits directional sensitivity, which helps prevent image blurring caused by muons scattered from the Earth's surface and entering the detector from the rear. This capability enables applications in non-invasive archaeological and geophysical imaging.</description>

      <title>Photonuclear treatment for spent fuel radiotoxicity reduction: a case study investigation on minor actinides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The management of Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) is one of the main challenges in the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Thermal reactors, such as Light Water Reactors (LWRs), produce significant amounts of minor actinides (MAs) such as Americium, Curium, and Neptunium, which are key contributors to the long-term radiotoxicity and decay heat in SNF. Currently, the long term widely accepted solution is the geological disposal. At the same time, advanced technologies like Partitioning and Transmutation (P\&amp;T) offer promising solutions to reduce SNF long-term radiotoxicity. While most transmutation strategies rely on neutron fluxes, in this study the adoption of photon beam to induce photonuclear reactions in SNF is investigated, without depending on neutron based systems. In particular, the study focuses on the probability of inducing transmutations and fissions on MAs, by leveraging the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) region of photonuclear interactions. In the investigated case study, the effect of a photon driven transmutation of minor actinides present in a spent fuel from SMR technology was evaluated. This approach offers a novel solution to the challenges of nuclear waste management which may become an alternative path in treating the radiotoxicity of minor actinides with the adoption of high enough photon fluxes.</description>

      <title>Deep source separation of overlapping gravitational-wave signals and non-stationary noise artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, detecting signals from a vast number of astrophysical sources embedded in instrumental noise. Extracting individual signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA data analysis and is traditionally addressed using computationally expensive stochastic Bayesian techniques. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for blind source separation in LISA data, employing an encoder-decoder architecture commonly used in digital audio processing to isolate individual signals within complex mixtures. Our approach enables signals from massive black-hole binaries, Galactic binaries, and instrumental glitches to be disentangled directly in a single step, circumventing the need for sequential source identification and subtraction. By learning clustered latent space representations, the framework provides a scalable alternative to conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and full-scale global-fit analyses. As a proof of concept, we assess the model's performance using simulated LISA data in a controlled setting with a limited number of overlapping sources. The results highlight deep source separation as a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Mic-hackathon 2024: Hackathon on Machine Learning for Electron and Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microscopy is a primary source of information on materials structure and functionality at nanometer and atomic scales. The data generated is often well-structured, enriched with metadata and sample histories, though not always consistent in detail or format. The adoption of Data Management Plans (DMPs) by major funding agencies promotes preservation and access. However, deriving insights remains difficult due to the lack of standardized code ecosystems, benchmarks, and integration strategies. As a result, data usage is inefficient and analysis time is extensive. In addition to post-acquisition analysis, new APIs from major microscope manufacturers enable real-time, ML-based analytics for automated decision-making and ML-agent-controlled microscope operation. Yet, a gap remains between the ML and microscopy communities, limiting the impact of these methods on physics, materials discovery, and optimization. Hackathons help bridge this divide by fostering collaboration between ML researchers and microscopy experts. They encourage the development of novel solutions that apply ML to microscopy, while preparing a future workforce for instrumentation, materials science, and applied ML. This hackathon produced benchmark datasets and digital twins of microscopes to support community growth and standardized workflows.
