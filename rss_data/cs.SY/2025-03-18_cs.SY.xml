      <title>Balancing SoC in Battery Cells using Safe Action Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing equal charge levels in active cell balancing while charging a Li-ion battery is challenging. An imbalance in charge levels affects the state of health of the battery, along with the concerns of thermal runaway and fire hazards. Traditional methods focus on safety assurance as a trade-off between safety and charging time. Others deal with battery-specific conditions to ensure safety, therefore losing on the generalization of the control strategies over various configurations of batteries. In this work, we propose a method to learn safe battery charging actions by using a safety-layer as an add-on over a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The safety layer perturbs the agent's action to prevent the battery from encountering unsafe or dangerous states. Further, our Deep RL framework focuses on learning a generalized policy that can be effectively employed with varying configurations of batteries. Our experimental results demonstrate that the safety-layer based action perturbation incurs fewer safety violations by avoiding unsafe states along with learning a robust policy for several battery configurations.</description>

      <title>Propensity Formation-Containment Control of Fully Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems via Online Data-Driven Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an online data-driven learning scheme designed to address a novel problem in propensity formation and containment control for fully heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, this problem considers the determination of follower positions based on propensity factors released by leaders. To address the challenge of incomplete utilization of leader information in existing multi-leader control methods, the concept of an influential transit formation leader (ITFL) is introduced. An adaptive observer is developed for the agents, including the ITFL, to estimate the state of the tracking leader or the leader's formation. Building on these observations, a model-based control protocol is proposed, elucidating the relationship between the regulation equations and control gains, ensuring the asymptotic convergence of the agent's state. To eliminate the necessity for model information throughout the control process, a new online data-driven learning algorithm is devised for the control protocol. Finally, numerical simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Low-pass sampling in Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a widely used sampling-based approach for real-time control, offering flexibility in handling arbitrary dynamics and cost functions. However, the original MPPI suffers from high-frequency noise in the sampled control trajectories, leading to actuator wear and inefficient exploration. In this work, we introduce Low-Pass Model Predictive Path Integral Control (LP-MPPI), which integrates low-pass filtering into the sampling process to eliminate detrimental high-frequency components and improve the effectiveness of the control trajectories exploration. Unlike prior approaches, LP-MPPI provides direct and interpretable control over the frequency spectrum of sampled trajectories, enhancing sampling efficiency and control smoothness. Through extensive evaluations in Gymnasium environments, simulated quadruped locomotion, and real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, we demonstrate that LP-MPPI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MPPI variants, achieving significant performance improvements while reducing control signal chattering.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Empty Container availability for Vehicle Booking System Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Container terminals, pivotal nodes in the network of empty container movement, hold significant potential for enhancing operational efficiency within terminal depots through effective collaboration between transporters and terminal operators. This collaboration is crucial for achieving optimization, leading to streamlined operations and reduced congestion, thereby benefiting both parties. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop the most suitable forecasting approaches to address this challenge. This study focuses on developing and evaluating a data-driven approach for forecasting empty container availability at container terminal depots within a Vehicle Booking System (VBS) framework. It addresses the gap in research concerning optimizing empty container dwell time and aims to enhance operational efficiencies in container terminal operations. Four forecasting models-Naive, ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM-are comprehensively analyzed for their predictive capabilities, with LSTM emerging as the top performer due to its ability to capture complex time series patterns. The research underscores the significance of selecting appropriate forecasting techniques tailored to the specific requirements of container terminal operations, contributing to improved operational planning and management in maritime logistics.</description>

      <title>Set-based and Dynamical Feedback-augmented Hands-off Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel set-theoretical approach to hands-off control is proposed, which focuses on spatial arguments for command limitation, rather than temporal ones. By employing dynamical feedback alongside invariant set-based constraints, actuation is employed only to drive the system's state inside a "hands-off region" of its state-space, where the plant may freely evolve in open-loop configuration. A computationally-efficient procedure with strong theoretical guarantees is devised, and its effectiveness is showcased via an intuitive practical example.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Predictive Control of Fast Lithium-ion Battery Pretreatment for Safe Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper disposal and repurposing of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries are critical for maximizing their environmental benefits. This study introduces a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to optimize the battery discharging process during pre-treatment, ensuring both efficiency and safety. The proposed method explicitly incorporates temperature constraints to prevent overheating and potential hazards. By leveraging a control-oriented equivalent circuit model integrated with thermal dynamics, the MPC algorithm dynamically adjusts the discharging profile to maintain safe operating temperatures. Additionally, the robust controller is designed to account for model mismatches between the nonlinear battery dynamics and the linearized model, ensuring reliable performance under varying conditions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through simulations comparing the robust MPC method with conventional discharging strategies, including constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) and constant current-constant temperature (CC-CT) methods. Results indicate that the robust MPC framework significantly reduces discharging time while adhering to safety constraints, offering a promising solution for the recycling and second-life applications of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Ignition Point Reachability for Aerodynamically-Controlled Reusable Launch Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a successive convex programming (Sequential Convex Programming (SCP)) based approach for estimate the set of points where a 5-degree of freedom (5-DoF) reusable launch vehicle (RLV) returning to a landing site can transition from aerodynamic to propulsive descent. Determining the set of feasible ignition points that a RLV can use and then safely land is important for mission planning and range safety. However, past trajectory optimization approaches for RLVs consider substantially simplified versions of the vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, prior reachability analysis methods either do not extend to the full constraint set needed for an RLV or are too beset by the curse of dimensionality to handle the full 5-DoF dynamics. To solve this problem, we describe an algorithm that approximates the projection of a high dimensional reachable set onto a low dimensional space. Instead of computing all parts of the reachable space, we only calculate reachability in the projected space of interest by using repeated trajectory optimization to sample the reachable polytope in the reduced space. The optimization can take into account initial and terminal constraints as well as state and control constraints. We show that our algorithm is able to compute the projection of a reachable set into a low dimensional space by calculating the feasible ignition points for a two-phase aerodynamic/propulsive RLV landing trajectory, while also demonstrating the aerodynamic divert enabled by our body and fin actuator model.</description>

      <title>Formally Proving Invariant Systemic Properties of Control Programs Using Ghost Code and Integral Quadratic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on formally verifying invariant properties of control programs both at the model and code levels. The physical process is described by an uncertain discrete-time state-space system, where the dependence of the state-space matrix-valued functions defining the system on the uncertainties can be rational. The proposed approaches make use of pointwise integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) to characterize the uncertainties affecting the behavior of the system. Various uncertainties can be characterized by pointwise IQCs, including static linear time-varying perturbations and sector-bounded nonlinearities. Using the IQC framework, a sound overapproximation of the uncertain system, which is expressible at the code level, is constructed. Tools such as Frama-C, ACSL, WP, and an Alt-Ergo plugin are employed to ensure the validity of the state and output invariant properties across both real and float models. The first proposed approach can be used to formally verify (local) invariant properties of the control code. This capability is demonstrated in a couple of examples involving gain-scheduled path-following controllers designed for an uncrewed aircraft system and an autonomous underwater vehicle. The second approach enables the verification of closed-loop invariant properties, i.e., invariant properties of the controlled system as a whole, in both real and float models, while preserving the integrity of the executable controller code. This is achieved by using ghost code attached to the control code for all elements related to the plant model with uncertainties, as the ghost code does not interfere with the executable code. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in two examples on the control of a four-thruster hovercraft and the control of a two-mass rotational system.</description>

      <title>Exergy Battery Modeling and P2P Trading Based Optimal Operation of Virtual Energy Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual energy stations (VESs) work as retailers to provide electricity and natural gas sale services for integrated energy systems (IESs), and guide IESs energy consumption behaviors to tackle the varying market prices via integrated demand response (IDR). However, IES customers are risk averse and show low enthusiasm in responding to the IDR incentive signals. To address this problem, exergy is utilized to unify different energies and allowed to be virtually stored and withdrawn for arbitrage by IESs. The whole incentive mechanism operating process is innovatively characterized by a virtual exergy battery. Peer to peer (P2P) exergy trading based on shared exergy storage is also developed to reduce the energy cost of IESs without any extra transmission fee. In this way, IES can reduce the economic loss risk caused by the market price fluctuation via the different time (time dimension), multiple energy conversion (energy dimension), and P2P exergy trading (space dimension) arbitrage. Moreover, the optimal scheduling of VES and IESs is modeled by a bilevel optimization model. The consensus based alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve this problem in a distributed way. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism and show that the shared exergy storage can enhance the benefits of different type IESs by 18.96%, 3.49%, and 3.15 %, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Profit Sharing Mechanism for Coordinated Power Traffic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the scheduling process, the traffic network operator (TNO) and the distribution network operator (DNO) act noncooperatively. Under the TNO management, the distribution of charging loads may exacerbate the local supply demand imbalance in the power distribution network (PDN), which negatively impacts the economic operation of the PDN. This paper proposes a profitsharing mechanism based on the principle of incentive compatibility for coordinating the traffic network (TN) and the PDN to minimize the operation cost of PDN. Under this mechanism, the scheduling process of the power traffic system is divided into two stages. At the prescheduling stage, the TNO allocates traffic flow and charging loads without considering the operation of the PDN, after which the DNO schedules and obtains the original cost. At the rescheduling stage, the DNO shares part of benefits of the optimal operation to the TNO to redispatch the EV charging to obtain a more effective charging plan, thus minimize the overall cost of PDN. Then, a bilevel model is developed to simulate the operation of the power traffic system with the proposed sharing scheme and identify the best sharing ratio. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the PDN can achieve the minimum total cost and simultaneously the TN can also benefit from the proposed profit sharing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fast Critical Clearing Time Calculation for Power Systems with Synchronous and Asynchronous Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewables is replacing traditional synchronous generation in modern power systems with low-inertia asynchronous converter-interfaced generators (CIGs). This penetration threatens the dynamic stability of the modern power system. To assess the latter, we resort to the critical clearing time (CCT) as a stability index, which is typically computed through a large number of time-domain simulations. This is especially true for CIG-embedded power systems, where the complexity of the model is further increased. To alleviate the computing burden, we developed a trajectory sensitivity-based method for assessing the CCT in power systems with synchronous and asynchronous generators. This allows us to obtain the CCT cost-effectively. The simulation results reveal the excellent performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Formation Control of Multi-agent System with Local Interaction and Artificial Potential Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel local interaction control method (LICM) is proposed in this paper to realize the formation control of multi-agent system (MAS). A local interaction leader follower (LILF) structure is provided by coupling the advantages of information consensus and leader follower frame, the agents can obtain the state information of the leader by interacting with their neighbours, which will reduce the communication overhead of the system and the dependence on a single node of the topology. In addition, the artificial potential field (APF) method is introduced to achieve obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance between agents. Inspired by the stress response of animals, a stress response mechanism-artificial potential field (SRM-APF) is proposed, which will be triggered when the local minimum problem of APF occurs. Ultimately, the simulation experiments of three formation shapes, including triangular formation, square formation and hexagonal formation, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Lithium-ion Battery Capacity Prediction via Conditional Recurrent Generative Adversarial Network-based Time-Series Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate capacity prediction is essential for the safe and reliable operation of batteries by anticipating potential failures beforehand. The performance of state-of-the-art capacity prediction methods is significantly hindered by the limited availability of training data, primarily attributed to the expensive experimentation and data sharing restrictions. To tackle this issue, this paper presents a recurrent conditional generative adversarial network (RCGAN) scheme to enrich the limited battery data by adding high-fidelity synthetic ones to improve the capacity prediction. The proposed RCGAN scheme consists of a generator network to generate synthetic samples that closely resemble the true data and a discriminator network to differentiate real and synthetic samples. Long shortterm memory (LSTM)-based generator and discriminator are leveraged to learn the temporal and spatial distributions in the multivariate time-series battery data. Moreover, the generator is conditioned on the capacity value to account for changes in battery dynamics due to the degradation over usage cycles. The effectiveness of the RCGAN is evaluated across six batteries from two benchmark datasets (NASA and MIT). The raw data is then augmented with synthetic samples from the RCGAN to train LSTM and gate recurrent unit (GRU) models for capacity prediction. Simulation results show that the models trained with augmented datasets significantly outperform those trained with the original datasets in capacity prediction.</description>

      <title>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</description>

      <title>Computing Modes of Instability of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineered systems naturally experience large disturbances that can disrupt desired operation because the system may fail to recover to a stable equilibrium point. It is valuable to determine the mechanism of instability when the system is subject to a particular finite-time disturbance, because this information can be used to improve vulnerability detection, and to design controllers to reduce vulnerability. Often there exists a particular unstable equilibrium point on the region of attraction boundary of the stable equilibrium point such that the unstable eigenvector of the Jacobian at this unstable equilibrium point represents the mode of instability for the disturbance. Unfortunately, it is challenging to find this mode of instability, especially in high dimensional systems, because it is computationally intractable to obtain this particular unstable equilibrium point. This paper develops a novel algorithm for numerically computing the mode of instability for parameterized nonlinear systems without identifying the particular unstable equilibrium point, resulting in a computationally efficient method. The key idea is to first consider the setting where the system recovers, and to average the Jacobian along the system trajectory from the post-disturbance state up until the Jacobian becomes stable. As the system approaches inability to recover, the averaged Jacobians converge to the Jacobian at the particular unstable equilibrium point, and can be used to extract the unstable eigenvector representing the mode of instability. Convergence guarantees are provided for computing the mode of instability, both for the theoretical setting in continuous time, and for the proposed algorithm which relies on numerical integration. Numerical examples illustrate the successful application of the method to identify the mechanism of instability in power systems subject to temporary short circuits.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Enforce Non-Negativity Constraint in Neural Network Approximation for Optimal Voltage Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system voltage regulation is crucial to maintain power quality while integrating intermittent renewable resources in distribution grids. However, the system model on the grid edge is often unknown, making it difficult to model physical equations for optimal control. Therefore, previous work proposes structured data-driven methods like input convex neural networks (ICNN) for "optimal" control without relying on a physical model. While ICNNs offer theoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural network (NN) parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step on negative duplication of inputs? We show that such added mirroring step fails to improve accuracy, as a linear combination of the original input and duplicated input is equivalent to a linear operation of ICNN's input without duplication. While this design can not improve performance, we propose a unified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized optimization of NN, contrary to the existing methods, which added a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter negation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously minimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints. Numerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that our integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and non-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.</description>

      <title>Iterative Motion Planning in Multi-agent Systems with Opportunistic Communication under Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex multi-agent systems involving heterogeneous teams, uncertainty arises from numerous sources like environmental disturbances, model inaccuracies, and changing tasks. This causes planned trajectories to become infeasible, requiring replanning. Further, different communication architectures used in multi-agent systems give rise to asymmetric knowledge of planned trajectories across the agents. In such systems, replanning must be done in a communication-aware fashion. This paper establishes the conditions for synchronization and feasibility in epistemic planning scenarios introduced by opportunistic communication architectures. We also establish conditions on task satisfaction based on quantified recoverability of disturbances in an iterative planning scheme. We further validate these theoretical results experimentally in a UAV--UGV task assignment problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12566v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper outlines the existing situation and future trends related to automobile battery packs, specifically from the automobile manufacturer's point of view. It formulates the specifications required for such packs to adhere to prevailing regulatory schemes and examines top-level solutions to target a uniform architecture for passenger cars. Key elements such as electrical performance, safety, mechanical integrity, reliability, environmental issues, diagnostics, and real-world implications have been extensively examined. This paper draws attention to the industry trend of shifting to high-voltage battery architectures to enable ultra-fast charging above 350 kW, reducing the charging time to less than 20 minutes. Technological advancements in energy density and battery pack capacities are poised to take electric vehicle ranges over 1000 km from a single charge. This study also examines developments in artificial intelligence-improved battery management systems, enhanced safety, mechanical integrity, reliability, diagnostics, and practical considerations. Furthermore, future developments, such as the incorporation of batteries in aviation and other new uses, are investigated to provide insight into the future generation of economically viable, secure, and high-performance battery systems.</description>

      <title>Routing Guidance for Emerging Transportation Systems with Improved Dynamic Trip Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a dynamic routing guidance system that optimizes route recommendations for individual vehicles within an emerging transportation system while enhancing travelers' trip equity. We develop a framework to quantify trip quality and equity in a dynamic travel environment, providing new insights into how routing guidance influences equity in road transportation. Our approach enables real-time routing by incorporating both monitored and anticipated traffic congestion. We provide conditions that ensure achieving perfect trip equity for all travelers in a free-flow network. Finally, simulation studies on 1,000 vehicles traversing an urban road network in Boston demonstrate that our proposed method improves trip equity by approximately 13.3\% compared to the shortest-route strategy. In addition, the results reveal that our approach redistributes travel costs across vehicle types through route optimization, contributing to a more equitable transportation system.</description>

      <title>Equivalent-Circuit Thermal Model for Batteries with One-Shot Parameter Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state of temperature (SOT) estimation for batteries is crucial for regulating their temperature within a desired range to ensure safe operation and optimal performance. The existing measurement-based methods often generate noisy signals and cannot scale up for large-scale battery packs. The electrochemical model-based methods, on the contrary, offer high accuracy but are computationally expensive. To tackle these issues, inspired by the equivalentcircuit voltage model for batteries, this paper presents a novel equivalent-circuit electro-thermal model (ECTM) for modeling battery surface temperature. By approximating the complex heat generation inside batteries with data-driven nonlinear (polynomial) functions of key measurable parameters such as state-of-charge (SOC), current, and terminal voltage, our ECTM is simplified into a linear form that admits rapid solutions. Such simplified ECTM can be readily identified with one single (one-shot) cycle data. The proposed model is extensively validated with benchmark NASA, MIT, and Oxford battery datasets. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the model, despite being identified with one-shot cycle data, in predicting battery temperatures robustly under different battery degradation status and ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Indoor Fusion Positioning Based on "IMU-Ultrasonic-UWB" and Factor Graph Optimization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-precision positioning system that integrates ultra-wideband (UWB) time difference of arrival (TDoA) measurements, inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, and ultrasonic sensors through factor graph optimization. To overcome the shortcomings of standalone UWB systems in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios and the inherent drift associated with inertial navigation, we developed a novel hybrid fusion framework. First, a dynamic covariance estimation mechanism is incorporated, which automatically adjusts measurement weights based on real-time channel conditions. Then, a tightly-coupled sensor fusion architecture is employed, utilizing IMU pre-integration theory for temporal synchronization. Finally, a sliding-window factor graph optimization backend is utilized, incorporating NLOS mitigation constraints. Experimental results in complex indoor environments show a 38\% improvement in positioning accuracy compared to conventional Kalman filter-based approaches, achieving a 12.3 cm root mean square (RMS) error under dynamic motion conditions. The system maintains robust performance even with intermittent UWB signal availability, down to a 40\% packet reception rate, effectively suppressing IMU drift through multi-modal constraint fusion. This work offers a practical solution for applications that require reliable indoor positioning in GPS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>System Identification Under Multi-rate Sensing Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a system identification algorithm for systems with multi-rate sensors in a discrete-time framework. It is challenging to obtain an accurate mathematical model when the ratios of inputs and outputs are different in the system. A cyclic reformulation-based model for multi-rate systems is formulated, and the multi-rate system can be reduced to a linear time-invariant system to derive the model under the multi-rate sensing environment. The proposed algorithm integrates a cyclic reformulation with a state coordinate transformation of the cycled system to enable precise identification of systems under the multi-rate sensing environment. The effectiveness of the proposed system identification method is demonstrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Suppression and Regulation of Thermal Birefringence in Optical Voltage Sensor with Isomerism Electrodes and Arbitrary Electric Field Direction Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insufficient stability and reliability of Optical Voltage Sensor is primarily caused by thermal stress induced birefringence. In this paper, a method based on arbitrary electric field direction modulation and isomerism electrodes is proposed to suppress or regulate it. With the aid of multi-physics Finite Element Method, Jones Matrix and the theory of photoelastic effect, it is found that metal or transparent isomerism electrodes can generate a special thermal stress distribution, which regulates the birefringence in the optical path and their induced measurement error. The experiment is conducted on a 10mm cubic bismuth germanite crystal, with cutting directions 110, -110 and 001. The experiment result shows that Cu isomerism electrodes with electric field angle of 59.9 degrees could generate 37% less birefringence error compared to parallel plate electrodes, in the temperature range from 25 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius. However, the Indium Tin Oxide electrodes with field angle of 29.6 degrees produces approximately 7 times error because of its bad ductility and thermal conduction. The proposed modeling and suppression method for birefringence is beneficial to design of high accuracy optical voltage sensor or electro-optical modulator.</description>

      <title>Layered Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robust Stabilization of Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the receding horizon optimal control of nonlinear hybrid systems is typically prohibitively slow, limiting real-time implementation. To address this challenge, we propose a layered Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture for robust stabilization of hybrid systems. A high level "hybrid" MPC is solved at a slow rate to produce a stabilizing hybrid trajectory, potentially sub-optimally, including a domain and guard sequence. This domain and guard sequence is passed to a low level "fixed mode" MPC which is a traditional, time-varying, state-constrained MPC that can be solved rapidly, e.g., using nonlinear programming (NLP) tools. A robust version of the fixed mode MPC is constructed by using tracking error tubes that are not guaranteed to have finite size for all time. Using these tubes, we demonstrate that the speed at which the fixed mode MPC is re-calculated is directly tied to the robustness of the system, thereby justifying the layered approach. Finally, simulation examples of a five link bipedal robot and a controlled nonlinear bouncing ball are used to illustrate the formal results.</description>

      <title>Robust Co-Optimization of Distribution Network Hardening and Mobile Resource Scheduling with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the robust co-planning of proactive network hardening and mobile hydrogen energy resources (MHERs) scheduling, which is to enhance the resilience of power distribution network (PDN) against the disastrous events. A decision-dependent robust optimization model is formulated with min-max resilience constraint and discrete recourse structure, which helps achieve the load survivability target considering endogenous uncertainties. Different from the traditional model with a fixed uncertainty set, we adopt a dynamic representation that explicitly captures the endogenous uncertainties of network contingency as well as the available hydrogen storage levels of MHERs, which induces a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Also, the multi-period adaptive routing and energy scheduling of MHERs are modeled as a mixed-integer recourse problem for further decreasing the resilience cost. Then, a nested parametric column-and-constraint generation (N-PC&amp;CG) algorithm is customized and developed to solve this challenging formulation. By leveraging the structural property of the DDU set as well as the combination of discrete recourse decisions and the corresponding extreme points, we derive a strengthened solution scheme with nontrivial enhancement strategies to realize efficient and exact computation. Numerical results on 14-bus test system and 56-bus real-world distribution network demonstrate the resilience benefits and economical feasibility of the proposed method under different damage severity levels. Moreover, the enhanced N-PC&amp;CG shows a superior solution capability to support prompt decisions for resilient planning with DDU models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter explores how pinching antennas, an advanced flexible-antenna system, can enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems by leveraging their adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to facilitate line-of-sight transmission. To achieve this, a joint antenna positioning and transmit power optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total communication data rate while meeting the target sensing requirements and the system energy constraint. To address the complex non-convex optimization problem, we propose a maximum entropy-based reinforcement learning (MERL) solution. By maximizing cumulative reward and policy entropy, this approach effectively balances exploration and exploitation to enhance robustness. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MERL algorithm surpasses other benchmark schemes in cumulative reward, total data rate, sensing signal-to-noise ratio, and stability.</description>

      <title>PD-Skygroundhook Controller for Semi-Active Suspension System Using Magnetorheological Fluid Dampers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Proportional-Derivative (PD) Skygroundhook controller for magnetorheological (MR) dampers in semi-active suspensions. Traditional skyhook, Groundhook, and hybrid Skygroundhook controllers are well-known for their ability to reduce body and wheel vibrations; however, each approach has limitations in handling a broad frequency spectrum and often relies on abrupt switching. By adding a derivative action to the classical Skygroundhook logic, the proposed PD-Skygroundhook method enhances high-frequency damping and stabilizes transition behaviors. By leveraging the fast response of MR dampers, our controller adjusts the damper force continuously in real time to match the desired damping force of PD-Skygroundhook controller with efficient computation. Experimental evaluations under bump excitations and sine-sweeping tests demonstrate a significant reduction in sprung mass acceleration and unsprung mass acceleration, outperforming standard Skygroundhook in both ride comfort and road handling. These results highlight that the derivative action effectively reduces resonance peaks and smooths out force transitions of regular Skygroundhook. Our method offers a robust alternative to more computationally demanding semi-active controllers.</description>

      <title>Designing RF-Powered Battery-Less Electronic Shelf Labels With COTS Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a preliminary study exploring the feasibility of designing batteryless electronic shelf labels (ESLs) powered by radio frequency wireless power transfer using commercial off-the-shelf components. The proposed ESL design is validated through a dedicated testbed and involves a detailed analysis of design choices, including energy consumption, energy conversion, and storage solutions. A leaded aluminium electrolytic capacitor is selected as the primary energy storage element, balancing cost and performance while maintaining compactness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that an ESL can update its display within 4 to 120 minutes, depending on input power and RF frequency, with harvester efficiencies reaching up to 30 %. Challenges such as low harvester efficiency, extended update times, and hardware constraints are identified, highlighting opportunities for future optimizations. This work provides valuable insights into system design considerations for RF-powered ESLs and establishes a foundation for further research in energy-neutral Internet of Things applications.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Innovation-based Stochastic and Deterministic Event Triggers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resources such as bandwidth and energy are limited in many wireless communications use cases, especially when large numbers of sensors and fusion centers need to exchange information frequently. One opportunity to overcome resource constraints is the use of event-based transmissions and estimation to transmit only information that contributes significantly to the reconstruction of the system's state. The design of efficient triggering policies and estimators is crucial for successful event-based transmissions. While previously deterministic and stochastic event triggering policies have been treated separately, this paper unifies the two approaches and gives insights into the design of consistent trigger-matching estimators. Two different estimators are presented, and different pairs of triggers and estimators are evaluated through simulation studies.</description>

Abstract: Sustainable technologies and services can play a pivotal role in the transition to "greener" habits. Their widespread adoption is thus crucial, and understanding how to foster this phenomenon in a systematic way could have a major impact on our future. With this in mind, in this work we propose an extension of the Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model toward characterizing the long-term impact of (structural) fostering policies. We then propose alternative nudging strategies that target a trade-off between widespread adoption and investments under budget constraints, showing the impact of our modeling and design choices on inclination shifts over a set of numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Compensating Hysteresis and Mechanical Misalignment in Piezo-Stepper Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezo-stepper actuators enable accurate positioning through the sequential contraction and expansion of piezoelectric elements, generating a walking motion. The aim of this paper is to reduce velocity ripples caused by parasitic effects, due to hysteresis in the piezoelectric material and mechanical misalignments, through suitable feedforward control. The presented approach involves the integration of a rate-dependent hysteresis model with a position-dependent feedforward learning scheme to compensate for these effects. Experimental results show that this approach leads to a significant reduction in the velocity ripples, even when the target velocity is changed. These results enable the use of piezo-stepper actuators in applications requiring high positioning accuracy and stiffness over a long stroke, without requiring expensive position sensors for high-gain feedback.</description>

      <title>Prioritized Planning for Continuous-time Lifelong Multi-agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning collision-free movements of agents such that they get from where they are to where they need to be. Commonly, agents are located on a graph and can traverse edges. This problem has many variations and has been studied for decades. Two such variations are the continuous-time and the lifelong MAPF problems. In the continuous-time MAPF problem, edges can have non-unit lengths and agents can traverse them at any real-valued time. Additionally, agent volumes are often included. In the lifelong MAPF problem, agents must attend to a continuous stream of incoming tasks. Much work has been devoted to designing solution methods within these two areas. However, to our knowledge, the combined problem of continuous-time lifelong MAPF has yet to be addressed.
  This work addresses continuous-time lifelong MAPF with agent volumes by presenting the fast and sub-optimal Continuous-time Prioritized Lifelong Planner (CPLP). CPLP continuously re-prioritizes tasks, assigns agents to them, and computes agent plans using a combination of two path planners; one based on CCBS and the other on SIPP. Experimental results with up to $400$ agents on graphs with $4000$ vertices demonstrate average computation times below $20$ ms per call. In online settings where available time to compute plans is limited, CPLP ensures collision-free movement even when failing to meet these time limits. Therefore, the robustness of CPLP highlights its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Local-Global Learning of Interpretable Control Policies: The Interface between MPC and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making optimal decisions under uncertainty is a shared problem among distinct fields. While optimal control is commonly studied in the framework of dynamic programming, it is approached with differing perspectives of the Bellman optimality condition. In one perspective, the Bellman equation is used to derive a global optimality condition useful for iterative learning of control policies through interactions with an environment. Alternatively, the Bellman equation is also widely adopted to derive tractable optimization-based control policies that satisfy a local notion of optimality. By leveraging ideas from the two perspectives, we present a local-global paradigm for optimal control suited for learning interpretable local decision makers that approximately satisfy the global Bellman equation. The benefits and practical complications in local-global learning are discussed. These aspects are exemplified through case studies, which give an overview of two distinct strategies for unifying reinforcement learning and model predictive control. We discuss the challenges and trade-offs in these local-global strategies, towards highlighting future research opportunities for safe and optimal decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Parameter Invariance Analysis of Moment Equations Using Dulmage-Mendelsohn Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living organisms maintain stable functioning amid environmental fluctuations through homeostasis, a mechanism that preserves a system's behavior despite changes in environmental conditions. To elucidate homeostasis in stochastic biochemical reactions, theoretical tools for assessing population-level invariance under parameter perturbations are crucial. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for identifying the stationary moments that remain invariant under parameter perturbations by leveraging the structural properties of the stationary moment equations. A key step in this development is addressing the underdetermined nature of moment equations, which has traditionally made it difficult to characterize how stationary moments depend on system parameters. To overcome this, we utilize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn (DM) decomposition of the coefficient matrix to extract welldetermined subequations and reveal their hierarchical structure. Leveraging this structure, we identify stationary moments whose partial derivatives with respect to parameters are structurally zero, facilitating the exploration of fundamental constraints that govern homeostatic behavior in stochastic biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>On Sampling Time and Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invariant sets define regions of the state space where system constraints are always satisfied. The majority of numerical techniques for computing invariant sets - whether exact, approximate, or based on pure data-driven rollouts - have been developed for discrete-time systems with a fixed sampling time. Understanding how invariant sets change with sampling time is critical for designing adaptive-sampling control schemes that ensure constraint satisfaction. This paper investigates the relationship between control invariance and the sampling frequency of the feedback controller. We introduce the notion of M-step hold control invariance and demonstrate that it generalizes traditional control invariance. We propose a computational method to calculate M-step hold invariants and show its practical use to assess the link between the feedback control sampling frequency and constraint satisfaction. We extend the framework to account for robustness against model mismatches and discretization errors, paving the way for adaptive-sampling constrained control strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of verifying safety for continuous-time dynamical systems. Developing upon recent advancements in data-driven verification, we use only a finite number of sampled trajectories to learn a barrier certificate, namely a function which verifies safety. We train a safety-informed neural network to act as this certificate, with an appropriately designed loss function to encompass the safety conditions. In addition, we provide probabilistic generalisation guarantees from discrete samples of continuous trajectories, to unseen continuous ones. Numerical investigations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and contrast it with related results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based error bounds of bilinear Koopman surrogate models for nonlinear data-driven control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Estimation of Structured Singular Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the size of the modeling error is crucial for robust control. Over the years, numerous metrics have been developed to quantify the model error in a control relevant manner. One of the most important such metrics is the structured singular value, as it leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for ensuring stability and robustness in feedback control under structured model uncertainty. Although the computation of the structured singular value is often intractable, lower and upper bounds for it can often be obtained if a model of the system is known. In this paper, we introduce a fully data-driven method to estimate a lower bound for the structured singular value, by conducting experiments on the system and applying power iterations to the collected data. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that this method effectively lower bounds the structured singular value, yielding results comparable to those obtained using the Robust Control toolbox of MATLAB.</description>

      <title>Safe Multi-Robotic Arm Interaction via 3D Convex Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-robot collisions pose a significant safety risk when multiple robotic arms operate in close proximity. We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging 3D convex shape-based High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with any nominal controller and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms.</description>

      <title>Bayes and Biased Estimators Without Hyper-parameter Estimation: Comparable Performance to the Empirical-Bayes-Based Regularized Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularized system identification has become a significant complement to more classical system identification. It has been numerically shown that kernel-based regularized estimators often perform better than the maximum likelihood estimator in terms of minimizing mean squared error (MSE). However, regularized estimators often require hyper-parameter estimation. This paper focuses on ridge regression and the regularized estimator by employing the empirical Bayes hyper-parameter estimator. We utilize the excess MSE to quantify the MSE difference between the empirical-Bayes-based regularized estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator for large sample sizes. We then exploit the excess MSE expressions to develop both a family of generalized Bayes estimators and a family of closed-form biased estimators. They have the same excess MSE as the empirical-Bayes-based regularized estimator but eliminate the need for hyper-parameter estimation. Moreover, we conduct numerical simulations to show that the performance of these new estimators is comparable to the empirical-Bayes-based regularized estimator, while computationally, they are more efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a 3D parallel robot with three identical five-degree-of-freedom chains connected to a circular brace end-effector, aimed to serve as an assistive device for patients with cervical spondylosis. The inverse kinematics of the system is solved analytically, whereas learning-based methods are deployed to solve the forward kinematics. The methods considered herein include a Koopman operator-based approach as well as a neural network-based approach. The task is to predict the position and orientation of end-effector trajectories. The dataset used to train these methods is based on the analytical solutions derived via inverse kinematics. The methods are tested both in simulation and via physical hardware experiments with the developed robot. Results validate the suitability of deploying learning-based methods for studying parallel mechanism forward kinematics that are generally hard to resolve analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical Bayes estimators are based on minimizing the average risk with the hyper-parameters in the weighting function being estimated from observed data. The performance of an empirical Bayes estimator is typically evaluated by its mean squared error (MSE). However, the explicit expression for its MSE is generally unavailable for finite sample sizes. To address this issue, we define a high-order analytical criterion: the excess MSE. It quantifies the performance difference between the maximum likelihood and empirical Bayes estimators. An explicit expression for the excess MSE of an empirical Bayes estimator employing a general data-dependent hyper-parameter estimator is derived. As specific instances, we provide excess MSE expressions for kernel-based regularized estimators using the scaled empirical Bayes, Stein unbiased risk estimation, and generalized cross-validation hyper-parameter estimators. Moreover, we propose a modification to the excess MSE expressions for regularized estimators for moderate sample sizes and show its improvement on accuracy in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating deformable objects like cloth is challenging due to their complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate state estimation and dynamics modeling. Prior work has struggled with robust cloth state estimation, while dynamics models, primarily based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are limited by their locality. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Building on this insight, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing the full cloth state from sparse RGB-D observations conditioned on a canonical cloth mesh and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves high-fidelity state reconstruction while reducing long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to GNN-based approaches. Integrated with model-predictive control (MPC), our framework successfully executes cloth folding on a real robotic system, demonstrating the potential of generative models for manipulation tasks with partial observability and complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic IRS Allocation for Spectrum-Sharing MIMO Communication and Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to assist cellular communications and radar sensing operations in a communications and sensing setup. The IRS dynamically allocates reflecting elements to simultaneously localize a target and assist a user's communication. To achieve this, we propose a novel optimization framework that jointly addresses beamforming design and IRS element allocation. Specifically, we formulate a Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE)-based approach that iteratively optimizes the transmit and receive beamforming vectors, IRS phase shifts, and element allocation. The allocation mechanism adaptively balances the number of IRS elements dedicated to communication and sensing subsystems by leveraging the signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio (SINR) between the two. The proposed solution ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining performance trade-offs. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in both communication and sensing SINRs under varying system parameters.</description>

      <title>A State Alignment-Centric Approach to Federated System Identification: The FedAlign Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents FedAlign, a Federated Learning (FL) framework particularly designed for System Identification (SYSID) tasks by aligning state representations. Local workers can learn State-Space Models (SSMs) with equivalent representations but different dynamics. We demonstrate that directly aggregating these local SSMs via FedAvg results in a global model with altered system dynamics. FedAlign overcomes this problem by employing similarity transformation matrices to align state representations of local SSMs, thereby establishing a common parameter basin that retains the dynamics of local SSMs. FedAlign computes similarity transformation matrices via two distinct approaches: FedAlign-A and FedAlign-O. In FedAlign-A, we represent the global SSM in controllable canonical form (CCF). We apply control theory to analytically derive similarity transformation matrices that convert each local SSM into this form. Yet, establishing global SSM in CCF brings additional alignment challenges in multi input - multi output SYSID as CCF representation is not unique, unlike in single input - single output SYSID. In FedAlign-O, we address these alignment challenges by reformulating the local parameter basin alignment problem as an optimization task. We determine the parameter basin of a local worker as the common parameter basin and solve least square problems to obtain similarity transformation matrices needed to align the remaining local SSMs. Through the experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that FedAlign outperforms FedAvg, converges faster, and provides improved stability of the global SSM thanks to the efficient alignment of local parameter basins.</description>

      <title>D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric adaptive payload tracking for an offshore crane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonparametric adaptive crane control system is proposed where the crane payload tracks a desired trajectory with feedback from the payload position. The payload motion is controlled with the position of the crane tip using partial feedback linearization. This is made possible by introducing a novel model structure given in Cartesian coordinates. This Cartesian model structure makes it possible to implement a nonparametric adaptive controller which cancels disturbances by approximating the effects of unknown disturbance forces and structurally unknown dynamics in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). It is shown that the nonparametric adaptive controller leads to uniformly ultimately bounded errors in the presence of unknown forces and unmodeled dynamics. Moreover, it is shown that the Cartesian formulation has certain advantages in payload tracking control also in the non-adaptive case. The performance of the nonparametric adaptive controller is validated in simulation and experiments with good results.</description>

      <title>Bi-Criteria Optimization for Combinatorial Bandits: Sublinear Regret and Constraint Violation under Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study bi-criteria optimization for combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with bandit feedback. We propose a general framework that transforms discrete bi-criteria offline approximation algorithms into online algorithms with sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) guarantees. Our framework requires the offline algorithm to provide an $(\alpha, \beta)$-bi-criteria approximation ratio with $\delta$-resilience and utilize $\texttt{N}$ oracle calls to evaluate the objective and constraint functions. We prove that the proposed framework achieves sub-linear regret and CCV, with both bounds scaling as ${O}\left(\delta^{2/3} \texttt{N}^{1/3}T^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(T)\right)$. Crucially, the framework treats the offline algorithm with $\delta$-resilience as a black box, enabling flexible integration of existing approximation algorithms into the CMAB setting. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply our framework to several combinatorial problems, including submodular cover, submodular cost covering, and fair submodular maximization. These applications highlight the framework's broad utility in adapting offline guarantees to online bi-criteria optimization under bandit feedback.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Control and Disturbance Mitigation of an Underwater Multi-Segment Continuum Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of soft and compliant manipulators in marine environments represents a promising paradigm shift for subsea inspection, with devices better suited to tasks owing to their ability to safely conform to items during contact. However, limitations driven by material characteristics often restrict the reach of such devices, with the complexity of obtaining state estimations making control non-trivial. Here, a detailed analysis of a 1m long compliant manipulator prototype for subsea inspection tasks is presented, including its mechanical design, state estimation technique, closed-loop control strategies, and experimental performance evaluation in underwater conditions. Results indicate that both the configuration-space and task-space controllers implemented are capable of positioning the end effector to desired locations, with deviations of &lt;5% of the manipulator length spatially and to within 5^{o} of the desired configuration angles. The manipulator was also tested when subjected to various disturbances, such as loads of up to 300g and random point disturbances, and was proven to be able to limit displacement and restore the desired configuration. This work is a significant step towards the implementation of compliant manipulators in real-world subsea environments, proving their potential as an alternative to classical rigid-link designs.</description>

      <title>Polytope Volume Monitoring Problem: Formulation and Solution via Parametric Linear Program Based Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the latest research on feasible space monitoring of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) as well as polytopic collision avoidance, this paper studies the Polytope Volume Monitoring (PVM) problem, whose goal is to design a control law for inputs of nonlinear systems to prevent the volume of some state-dependent polytope from decreasing to zero. Recent studies have explored the idea of applying Chebyshev ball method in optimization theory to solve the case study of PVM; however, the underlying difficulties caused by nonsmoothness have not been addressed. This paper continues the study on this topic, where our main contribution is to establish the relationship between nonsmooth CBF and parametric optimization theory through directional derivatives for the first time, so as to solve PVM problems more conveniently. In detail, inspired by Chebyshev ball approach, a parametric linear program (PLP) based nonsmooth barrier function candidate is established for PVM, and then, sufficient conditions for it to be a nonsmooth CBF are proposed, based on which a quadratic program (QP) based safety filter with guaranteed feasibility is proposed to address PVM problems. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed safety filter.</description>

      <title>MUKCa: Accurate and Affordable Cobot Calibration Without External Measurement Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To increase the reliability of collaborative robots in performing daily tasks, we require them to be accurate and not only repeatable. However, having a calibrated kinematics model is regrettably a luxury, as available calibration tools are usually more expensive than the robots themselves. With this work, we aim to contribute to the democratization of cobots calibration by providing an inexpensive yet highly effective alternative to existing tools. The proposed minimalist calibration routine relies on a 3D-printable tool as the only physical aid to the calibration process. This two-socket spherical-joint tool kinematically constrains the robot at the end effector while collecting the training set. An optimization routine updates the nominal model to ensure a consistent prediction for each socket and the undistorted mean distance between them. We validated the algorithm on three robotic platforms: Franka, Kuka, and Kinova Cobots. The calibrated models reduce the mean absolute error from the order of 10 mm to 0.2 mm for both Franka and Kuka robots. We provide two additional experimental campaigns with the Franka Robot to render the improvements more tangible. First, we implement Cartesian control with and without the calibrated model and use it to perform a standard peg-in-the-hole task with a tolerance of 0.4 mm between the peg and the hole. Second, we perform a repeated drawing task combining Cartesian control with learning from demonstration. Both tasks consistently failed when the model was not calibrated, while they consistently succeeded after calibration.</description>

      <title>Integration Error Regularization in Direct Optimal Control using Embedded Runge Kutta Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to solve continuous-time optimal control problems, direct methods transcribe the infinite-dimensional problem to a nonlinear program (NLP) using numerical integration methods. In cases where the integration error can be manipulated by the chosen control trajectory, the transcription might produce spurious local NLP solutions as a by-product. While often this issue can be addressed by increasing the accuracy of the integration method, this is not always computationally acceptable, e.g., in the case of embedded optimization. Therefore, alternatively, we propose to estimate the integration error using established embedded Runge-Kutta methods and to regularize this estimate in the NLP cost function, using generalized norms. While this regularization is effective at eliminating spurious solutions, it inherently comes with a loss of optimality of valid solutions. The regularization can be tuned to minimize this loss, using a single parameter that can be intuitively interpreted as the maximum allowable estimated local integration error. In a numerical example based on a system with stiff dynamics, we show how this methodology enables the use of a computationally cheap explicit integration method, achieving a speedup of a factor of 3 compared to an otherwise more suitable implicit method, with a loss of optimality of only 3\%.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Multistage Optimization Structure in Proximal Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient structure-exploiting algorithm for multistage optimization problems, implemented as a new backend in the PIQP solver. The proposed method extends existing approaches by supporting full coupling between stages and global decision variables in the cost as well as equality and inequality constraints. The solver leverages a specialized block-tri-diagonal-arrow Cholesky factorization within a proximal interior-point framework to handle the underlying problem structure efficiently. The implementation features automatic structure detection and seamless integration with existing interfaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, achieving up to 13x speed-up compared to a generic sparse backend and matching/exceeding the performance of the state-of-the-art specialized solver HPIPM. The solver is particularly effective for applications such as model predictive control, robust scenario optimization, and periodic optimization problems.</description>

      <title>RL-TIME: Reinforcement Learning-based Task Replication in Multicore Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedded systems power many modern applications and must often meet strict reliability, real-time, thermal, and power requirements. Task replication can improve reliability by duplicating a task's execution to handle transient and permanent faults, but blindly applying replication often leads to excessive overhead and higher temperatures. Existing design-time methods typically choose the number of replicas based on worst-case conditions, which can waste resources under normal operation. In this paper, we present RL-TIME, a reinforcement learning-based approach that dynamically decides the number of replicas according to actual system conditions. By considering both the reliability target and a core-level Thermal Safe Power (TSP) constraint at run-time, RL-TIME adapts the replication strategy to avoid unnecessary overhead and overheating. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, RL-TIME reduces power consumption by 63%, increases schedulability by 53%, and respects TSP 72% more often.</description>

      <title>CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Successive Convexification: Trajectory Optimization on Smooth Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental issue at the core of trajectory optimization on smooth manifolds is handling the implicit manifold constraint within the dynamics. The conventional approach is to enforce the dynamic model as a constraint. However, we show this approach leads to significantly redundant operations, as well as being heavily dependent on the state space representation. Specifically, we propose an intrinsic successive convexification methodology for optimal control on smooth manifolds. This so-called iSCvx is then applied to a representative example involving attitude trajectory optimization for a spacecraft subject to non-convex constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel multi-robot task allocation framework for robots that can switch between multiple modes, e.g., flying, driving, or walking. We first provide a method to encode the multi-mode property of robots as a graph, where the mode of each robot is represented by a node. Next, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to decide both the task to be allocated to each robot as well as the mode in which the latter should execute the task. The robot modes are optimized based on the state of the robot and the environment, as well as the energy required to execute the allocated task. Moreover, the proposed framework is able to encompass kinematic and dynamic models of robots alike. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of task execution and allocation for both robot models.</description>

      <title>In vivo validation of Wireless Power Transfer System for Magnetically Controlled Robotic Capsule Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the in vivo validation of an inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) system integrated for the first time into a magnetically controlled robotic capsule endoscopy platform. The proposed system enables continuous power delivery to the capsule without the need for onboard batteries, thus extending operational time and reducing size constraints. The WPT system operates through a resonant inductive coupling mechanism, based on a transmitting coil mounted on the end effector of a robotic arm that also houses an external permanent magnet and a localization coil for precise capsule manipulation. To ensure robust and stable power transmission in the presence of coil misalignment and rotation, a 3D receiving coil is integrated within the capsule. Additionally, a closed-loop adaptive control system, based on load-shift keying (LSK) modulation, dynamically adjusts the transmitted power to optimize efficiency while maintaining compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits. The system has been extensively characterized in laboratory settings and validated through in vivo experiments using a porcine model, demonstrating reliable power transfer and effective robotic navigation in realistic gastrointestinal conditions: the average received power was 110 mW at a distance of 9 cm between the coils, with variable capsule rotation angles. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed WPT approach for autonomous, battery-free robotic capsule endoscopy, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic in gastrointestinal medicine.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Region-Based Approach for Efficient Multi-Robot Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-robot autonomous exploration in an unknown environment is an important application in robotics.Traditional exploration methods only use information around frontier points or viewpoints, ignoring spatial information of unknown areas. Moreover, finding the exact optimal solution for multi-robot task allocation is NP-hard, resulting in significant computational time consumption. To address these issues, we present a hierarchical multi-robot exploration framework using a new modeling method called RegionGraph. The proposed approach makes two main contributions: 1) A new modeling method for unexplored areas that preserves their spatial information across the entire space in a weighted graph called RegionGraph. 2) A hierarchical multi-robot exploration framework that decomposes the global exploration task into smaller subtasks, reducing the frequency of global planning and enabling asynchronous exploration. The proposed method is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating a 20% improvement in efficiency compared to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Fully decentralized, safe, and deadlock-free multi-robot navigation in dynamic, cluttered environments is a critical challenge in robotics. Current methods require exact state measurements in order to enforce safety and liveness e.g. via control barrier functions (CBFs), which is challenging to achieve directly from onboard sensors like lidars and cameras. This work introduces LIVEPOINT, a decentralized control framework that synthesizes universal CBFs over point clouds to enable safe, deadlock-free real-time multi-robot navigation in dynamic, cluttered environments. Further, LIVEPOINT ensures minimally invasive deadlock avoidance behavior by dynamically adjusting agents' speeds based on a novel symmetric interaction metric. We validate our approach in simulation experiments across highly constrained multi-robot scenarios like doorways and intersections. Results demonstrate that LIVEPOINT achieves zero collisions or deadlocks and a 100% success rate in challenging settings compared to optimization-based baselines such as MPC and ORCA and neural methods such as MPNet, which fail in such environments. Despite prioritizing safety and liveness, LIVEPOINT is 35% smoother than baselines in the doorway environment, and maintains agility in constrained environments while still being safe and deadlock-free.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Inexpensive Inertia Tensor Estimation from a Single Object Throw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inertia tensor is an important parameter in many engineering fields, but measuring it can be cumbersome and involve multiple experiments or accurate and expensive equipment. We propose a method to measure the moment of inertia tensor of a rigid body from a single spinning throw, by attaching a small and inexpensive stand-alone measurement device consisting of a gyroscope, accelerometer and a reaction wheel. The method includes a compensation for the increase of moment of inertia due to adding the measurement device to the body, and additionally obtains the location of the centre of gravity of the body as an intermediate result. Experiments performed with known rigid bodies show that the mean accuracy is around 2\%.</description>

      <title>Laplace-Net: Learning Dynamical Systems with External Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling forced dynamical systems - where an external input drives the system state - is critical across diverse domains such as engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In this work, we propose Laplace-Net, a decoupled, solver-free neural framework for learning forced and delay-aware systems. It leverages a Laplace transform-based approach to decompose internal dynamics, external inputs, and initial values into established theoretical concepts, enhancing interpretability. Laplace-Net promotes transferability since the system can be rapidly re-trained or fine-tuned for new forcing signals, providing flexibility in applications ranging from controller adaptation to long-horizon forecasting. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets - including linear, non-linear, and delayed systems - demonstrate the method's improved accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling complex and previously unseen inputs.</description>

      <title>Robust Decision-Making Via Free Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their groundbreaking performance, state-of-the-art autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training/environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge when deploying agents in the real world. Here, departing from mainstream views seeking robustness through training, we introduce DR-FREE, a free energy model that installs this core property by design. It directly wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms via free energy minimization. By combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy that is optimal-yet-robust against ambiguity. Moreover, for the first time, it reveals the mechanistic role of ambiguity on optimal decisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating. We evaluate DR-FREE on an experimental testbed involving real rovers navigating an ambiguous environment filled with obstacles. Across all the experiments, DR-FREE enables robots to successfully navigate towards their goal even when, in contrast, standard free energy minimizing agents that do not use DR-FREE fail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle scenarios that elude previous methods: this milestone may inspire both deployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for a biologically plausible explanation of how natural agents - with little or no training - survive in capricious environments.</description>

      <title>Artificial Spacetimes for Reactive Control of Resource-Limited Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-based reactive control provides a minimalist, decentralized route to guiding robots that lack onboard computation. Such schemes are well suited to resource-limited machines like microrobots, yet implementation artifacts, limited behaviors, and the frequent lack of formal guarantees blunt adoption. Here, we address these challenges with a new geometric approach called artificial spacetimes. We show that reactive robots navigating control fields obey the same dynamics as light rays in general relativity. This surprising connection allows us to adopt techniques from relativity and optics for constructing and analyzing control fields. When implemented, artificial spacetimes guide robots around structured environments, simultaneously avoiding boundaries and executing tasks like rallying or sorting, even when the field itself is static. We augment these capabilities with formal tools for analyzing what robots will do and provide experimental validation with silicon-based microrobots. Combined, this work provides a new framework for generating composed robot behaviors with minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>Mixtures of ensembles: System separation and identification via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crowd dynamics and many large biological systems can be described as populations of agents or particles, which can only be observed on aggregate population level. Identifying the dynamics of agents is crucial for understanding these large systems. However, the population of agents is typically not homogeneous, and thus the aggregate observations consist of the superposition of multiple ensembles each governed by individual dynamics. In this work, we propose an optimal transport framework to jointly separate the population into several ensembles and identify each ensemble's dynamical system, based on aggregate observations of the population. We propose a bi-convex optimization problem, which we solve using a block coordinate descent with convergence guarantees. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits close-to-oracle performance also in noisy settings, yielding accurate estimates of both the ensembles and the parameters governing their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mixed Small Gain and Phase Theorem: A new view using Scale Relative Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to feedback stability analysis for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, overcoming the limitations of the sectoriality assumption in the small phase theorem. While phase analysis for single-input single-output (SISO) systems is well-established, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems lack a comprehensive phase analysis until recent advances introduced with the small-phase theorem.
  A limitation of the small-phase theorem is the sectorial condition, which states that an operator's eigenvalues must lie within a specified angle sector of the complex plane. We propose a framework based on Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) to remove this assumption. We derive two main results: a graphical set-based stability condition using SRGs and a small-phase theorem with no sectorial assumption. These results broaden the scope of phase analysis and feedback stability for MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Discrete-Time Control and Filtering Limitations by the I-MMSE Relationships</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamental limitations or performance trade-offs/limits are important properties and constraints of both control and filtering systems. Among various trade-off metrics, total information rate that characterizes the sensitivity trade-offs and time-averaged performance of control and filtering systems was conventionally studied by using the differential entropy rate and Kolmogorov-Bode formula. In this paper, by extending the famous I-MMSE (mutual information -- minimum mean-square error) relationships to the discrete-time additive white Gaussian channels with and without feedback, a new paradigm is introduced to estimate and analyze total information rate as a control and filtering trade-off metric. Under this framework, we explore the trade-off properties of total information rate for a variety of the discrete-time control and filtering systems, e.g., LTI, LTV, and nonlinear, and propose an alternative approach to investigate total information rate via optimal estimation.</description>

      <title>Advanced safety filter based on SOS Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel safety filter framework that ensures both safety and the preservation of the legacy control action within a nominal region. This modular design allows the safety filter to be integrated into the control hierarchy without compromising the performance of the existing legacy controller within the nominal region. This is accomplished by formulating multiple Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov-like Functions (CLFs) conditions, alongside a forward invariance condition for the legacy controller, as sum-of-squares constraints utilizing Putinar's Positivstellensatz. Additionally, the state-dependent inequality constraints of the resulting Quadratic Program -- encoding the CBF and CLF conditions -- are designed to remain inactive within the nominal region, ensuring perfect tracking of the legacy control action. Our safety filter design is also the first to include quadratic input constraints, and does not need an explicit specification of the attractor, as it is implicitly defined by the legacy controller. To avoid the chattering effect and guarantee the uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of solutions, the state-dependent inequality constraints of the Quadratic Program are selected to be sufficiently regular. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a detailed case study involving the control of a three-phase ac/dc power converter.</description>

Abstract: Automated vehicle (AV) platooning has the potential to improve the safety, operational, and energy efficiency of surface transportation systems by limiting or eliminating human involvement in the driving tasks. The theoretical validity of the AV platooning strategies has been established and practical applications are being tested under real-world conditions. The emergence of sensors, communication, and control strategies has resulted in rapid and constant evolution of AV platooning strategies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in AV longitudinal platoon formation using a five-component platooning framework, which includes vehicle model, information-receiving process, information flow topology, spacing policy, and controller and discuss the advantages and limitations of the components. Based on the discussion about existing strategies and associated limitations, potential future research directions are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time adaptive controllers for systems with a matched uncertainty often comprise an online parameter estimator and a corresponding parameterized controller to cancel the uncertainty. However, such methods are often impossible to implement directly, as they depend on an unobserved estimation error. We consider the equivalent discrete-time setting with a causal information structure, and propose a novel, online proximal point method-based adaptive controller, that under a sufficient excitation (SE) condition is asymptotically stable and achieves finite regret, scaling only with the time required to fulfill the SE. We show the same also for the widely-used recursive least squares with exponential forgetting controller under a stronger persistence of excitation condition.</description>

Abstract: Modern industrial systems require frequent updates to their cyber and physical infrastructures, often demanding considerable reconfiguration effort. This paper introduces the industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Description Language, iCPS-DL, which enables autonomic reconfigurations for industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. The iCPS-DL maps an industrial process using semantics for physical and cyber-physical components, a state estimation model, and agent interactions. A novel aspect is using communication semantics to ensure live interaction among distributed agents. Reasoning on the semantic description facilitates the configuration of the industrial process control loop. A Water Distribution Networks domain case study demonstrates iCPS-DL's application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tracking of arbitrary curvilinear geometric paths in three-dimensional output spaces of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without pre-specified timing requirements, commonly referred to as path-following problems, subjected to bounded inputs. Specifically, we propose a novel nonlinear path-following guidance law for a UAV that enables it to follow any smooth curvilinear path in three dimensions while accounting for the bounded control authority in the design. The proposed solution offers a general treatment of the path-following problem by removing the dependency on the path's geometry, which makes it applicable to paths with varying levels of complexity and smooth curvatures. Additionally, the proposed strategy draws inspiration from the pursuit guidance approach, which is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the UAV converges to its desired path within a fixed time and remains on it irrespective of its initial configuration with respect to the path. Finally, the simulations demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the proposed guidance strategy through a wide range of engagement scenarios, showcasing the UAV's ability to follow diverse curvilinear paths accurately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning models of dynamical systems characterized by specific stability properties is of crucial importance in applications. Existing results mainly focus on linear systems or some limited classes of nonlinear systems and stability notions, and the general problem is still open. This article proposes a kernel-based nonlinear identification procedure to directly and systematically learn stable nonlinear discrete-time systems. In particular, the proposed method can be used to enforce, on the learned model, bounded-input-bounded-state stability, asymptotic gain, and input-to-state stability properties, as well as their incremental counterparts. To this aim, we build on the reproducing kernel theory and the Representer Theorem, which are suitably enhanced to handle stability constraints in the kernel properties and in the hyperparameters' selection algorithm. Once the methodology is detailed, and sufficient conditions for stability are singled out, the article reviews some widely used kernels and their applicability within the proposed framework. Finally, numerical results validate the theoretical findings showing, in particular, that stability may have a beneficial impact in long-term simulation with minimal impact on prediction.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel data-driven stochastic model predictive control framework for uncertain linear systems with noisy output measurements. Our approach leverages multi-step predictors to efficiently propagate uncertainty, ensuring chance constraint satisfaction. In particular, we present a strategy to identify multi-step predictors and quantify the associated uncertainty using a surrogate (data-driven) state space model. Then, we utilize the derived distribution to formulate a constraint tightening that ensures chance constraint satisfaction despite the parametric uncertainty. A numerical example highlights the reduced conservatism of handling parametric uncertainty in the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</description>

      <title>Two-Layer Attention Optimization for Bimanual Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bimanual tasks performed by human agents present unique optimal control considerations compared to cyberphysical agents. These considerations include minimizing attention, distributing attention across two isolated hands, and coordinating the two hands to reach a broader goal. In this work, we propose a two-layer controller that captures these considerations. The upper layer solves an attention distribution problem, while the two lower layer controllers (one per hand) tracks a trajectory using the solution given by the upper layer. We introduce a formulation of the attention controller where attention is a vector that is bound within a hyperbolic feasible region, which is determined by specifications of the task the lower layer controllers. This two-layer controller is used to optimize a single-player game of pong, where the agent must rally the ball between two paddles for as long as possible. We find that adding an attention layer on top of the lower controllers allows the agent to coordinate the left and right hands, which minimizes attention and control effort over the course of the rallying task.</description>

      <title>Enhancing reinforcement learning for population setpoint tracking in co-cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient multiple setpoint tracking can enable advanced biotechnological applications, such as maintaining desired population levels in co-cultures for optimal metabolic division of labor. In this study, we employ reinforcement learning as a control method for population setpoint tracking in co-cultures, focusing on policy-gradient techniques where the control policy is parameterized by neural networks. However, achieving accurate tracking across multiple setpoints is a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, as the agent must effectively balance the contributions of various setpoints to maximize the expected system performance. Traditional return functions, such as those based on a quadratic cost, often yield suboptimal performance due to their inability to efficiently guide the agent toward the simultaneous satisfaction of all setpoints. To overcome this, we propose a novel return function that rewards the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple setpoints and diminishes overall reward gains otherwise, accounting for both stage and terminal system performance. This return function includes parameters to fine-tune the desired smoothness and steepness of the learning process. We demonstrate our approach considering an $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ co-culture in a chemostat with optogenetic control over amino acid synthesis pathways, leveraging auxotrophies to modulate growth.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation with Quantized Measurements and Communication over Markovian Switching Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed parameter estimation in stochastic dynamic systems with quantized measurements, constrained by quantized communication and Markovian switching directed topologies. To enable accurate recovery of the original signal from quantized communication signal, a persistent excitation-compliant linear compression encoding method is introduced. Leveraging this encoding, this paper proposes an estimation-fusion type quantized distributed identification algorithm under a stochastic approximation framework. The algorithm operates in two phases: first, it estimates neighboring estimates using quantized communication information, then it creates a fusion estimate by combining these estimates through a consensus-based distributed stochastic approximation approach. To tackle the difficulty caused by the coupling between these two estimates, two combined Lyapunov functions are constructed to analyze the convergence performance. Specifically, the mean-square convergence of the estimates is established under a conditional expectation-type cooperative excitation condition and the union topology containing a spanning tree. Besides, the convergence rate is derived to match the step size's order under suitable step-size coefficients. Furthermore, the impact of communication uncertainties including stochastic communication noise and Markov-switching rate is analyzed on the convergence rate. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical findings and highlights the joint effect of sensors under quantized communication.</description>

      <title>Relative Pose Observability Analysis Using Dual Quaternions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Decentralized Stability Certificates for Grid-Forming Converter Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</description>

      <title>Ro-To-Go! Robust Reactive Control with Signal Temporal Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness is a common objective for optimal robot control, but its dependence on history limits the robot's decision-making capabilities when used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches. In this work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot-rolling process is a critical stage in sheet metal production within the heavy steel industry. Traditionally, parameter adjustments such as sheet metal velocity and roll gap are performed manually, leading to inefficiencies and limited precision. This project introduces an integrated mechatronics system designed to automate the control of rolling speed and sheet metal thickness, enhancing efficiency, consistency, and quality. The proposed system consists of a pair of rolls applying compression loads, with a mechanism for gap control, suitable motors and sensors, and dynamic modeling to optimize performance. Through simulation and practical implementation strategies, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating the hot-rolling process. By integrating mechatronics, this solution aims to modernize sheet metal production, improve productivity, and enhance product quality in the steel industry.</description>

      <title>ShieldNN: A Provably Safe NN Filter for Unsafe NN Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel closed-form Control Barrier Function (CBF) and associated controller shield for the Kinematic Bicycle Model (KBM) with respect to obstacle avoidance. The proposed CBF and shield -- designed by an algorithm we call ShieldNN -- provide two crucial advantages over existing methodologies. First, ShieldNN considers steering and velocity constraints directly with the non-affine KBM dynamics; this is in contrast to more general methods, which typically consider only affine dynamics and do not guarantee invariance properties under control constraints. Second, ShieldNN provides a closed-form set of safe controls for each state unlike more general methods, which typically rely on optimization algorithms to generate a single instantaneous for each state. Together, these advantages make ShieldNN uniquely suited as an efficient Multi-Obstacle Safe Actions (i.e. multiple-barrier-function shielding) during training time of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) enabled Neural Network controller. We show via experiments that ShieldNN dramatically increases the completion rate of RL training episodes in the presence of multiple obstacles, thus establishing the value of ShieldNN in training RL-based controllers.</description>

      <title>Exploring Robustness of Image Recognition Models on Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01697v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on resource-intensive and safety-critical tasks increases, a variety of Machine Learning (ML) compilers have been developed, enabling compatibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with a variety of hardware acceleration devices. However, given that DNNs are widely utilized for challenging and demanding tasks, the behavior of these compilers must be verified. To this direction, we propose MutateNN, a tool that utilizes elements of both differential and mutation testing in order to examine the robustness of image recognition models when deployed on hardware accelerators with different capabilities, in the presence of faults in their target device code - introduced either by developers, or problems in their compilation process. We focus on the image recognition domain by applying mutation testing to 7 well-established DNN models, introducing 21 mutations of 6 different categories. We deployed our mutants on 4 different hardware acceleration devices of varying capabilities and observed that DNN models presented discrepancies of up to 90.3% in mutants related to conditional operators across devices. We also observed that mutations related to layer modification, arithmetic types and input affected severely the overall model performance (up to 99.8%) or led to model crashes, in a consistent manner across devices.</description>

      <title>Learning Service Slowdown using Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Being able to identify service slowdowns is crucial to many operational problems. We study how to use observational congestion data to learn service slowdown in a multi-server system that uses adaptive congestion control mechanisms. We show that a commonly used summary statistic that relies on the marginal congestion measured at individual servers can be highly inaccurate in the presence of adaptive congestion control. We propose a new statistic based on potential routing actions, and show it provides a much more robust signal for server slowdown in these settings. Unlike the marginal statistic, potential action aims to detect changes in the routing actions, and is able to uncover slowdowns even when they do not reflect in marginal congestion. Our results highlight the complexity in performing observational statistical analysis for service systems in the presence of adaptive congestion control. They also suggest that practitioners may want to combine multiple, orthogonal statistics to achieve reliable slowdown detection.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Generation Policy Optimization (CGPO): Nonlinear Programming for Policy Optimization in Mixed Discrete-Continuous MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Constraint-Generation Policy Optimization (CGPO) framework to optimize policy parameters within compact and interpretable policy classes for mixed discrete-continuous Markov Decision Processes (DC-MDP). CGPO can not only provide bounded policy error guarantees over an infinite range of initial states for many DC-MDPs with expressive nonlinear dynamics, but it can also provably derive optimal policies in cases where it terminates with zero error. Furthermore, CGPO can generate worst-case state trajectories to diagnose policy deficiencies and provide counterfactual explanations of optimal actions. To achieve such results, CGPO proposes a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear optimization framework for optimizing policies in defined expressivity classes (e.g. piecewise linear) and reduces it to an optimal constraint generation methodology that adversarially generates worst-case state trajectories. Furthermore, leveraging modern nonlinear optimizers, CGPO can obtain solutions with bounded optimality gap guarantees. We handle stochastic transitions through chance constraints, providing high-probability performance guarantees. We also present a roadmap for understanding the computational complexities of different expressivity classes of policy, reward, and transition dynamics. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of CGPO across various domains, including inventory control, management of a water reservoir system, and physics control. In summary, CGPO provides structured, compact and explainable policies with bounded performance guarantees, enabling worst-case scenario generation and counterfactual policy diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Computing with an Electro-Optic Analog Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and biology. However, the rapid expansion of AI technologies has escalated the demand for more powerful computing resources. As digital computing approaches fundamental limits, neuromorphic photonics emerges as a promising platform to complement existing digital systems. In neuromorphic photonic computing, photonic devices are controlled using analog signals. This necessitates the use of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC) for interfacing with these devices during inference and training. However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann computing architectures consumes energy. To address this, analog memory co-located with photonic computing devices is proposed. This approach aims to reduce the reliance on DACs and minimize data movement to enhance compute efficiency. This paper demonstrates a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with co-located capacitive analog memory and analyzes analog memory specifications for neuromorphic photonic computing using the MNIST dataset as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Impact of Road Infrastructure and Traffic Scenarios on E-scooterists' Riding and Gaze Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of e-scooters has raised significant safety concerns, particularly due to a surge in injuries and fatalities. This study explores the relationship between road infrastructure, traffic scenarios, and e-scooterists' riding and gaze behaviors to improve road safety and user experience. A naturalistic study was conducted using instrumented e-scooters, capturing gaze patterns, fixation metrics, and head movement data across various road layouts and traffic scenarios. Key findings reveal that bike lanes offer a stable environment with reduced horizontal head movement and focused attention on the road, while shared roads and sidewalks lead to more dispersed gaze and increased head movement, indicating higher uncertainty and complexity. Interactions with other road users, such as navigating intersections, passing buses, riding near cars, and descending on downhill paths, demand greater cognitive load. Intersections require heightened visual focus and spatial awareness, reflected in increased horizontal eye and head movements. Interactions with vehicles prioritize visual scanning over head movement to maintain stability and avoid collisions, while high-speed and downhill riding demand focused attention on obstacles and the road surface. The results provide insights into e-scooter riders' behavior and physiological response analysis, paving the way for safer riding experiences and improved understanding of their needs.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of the cubic-regularized Newton method within a federated learning framework while addressing two major concerns that commonly arise in federated learning: privacy leakage and communication bottleneck. We introduce a federated learning algorithm called Differentially Private Federated Cubic Regularized Newton (DP-FCRN). By leveraging second-order techniques, our algorithm achieves lower iteration complexity compared to first-order methods. We also incorporate noise perturbation during local computations to ensure privacy. Furthermore, we employ sparsification in uplink transmission, which not only reduces the communication costs but also amplifies the privacy guarantee. Specifically, this approach reduces the necessary noise intensity without compromising privacy protection. We analyze the convergence properties of our algorithm and establish the privacy guarantee. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on a benchmark dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety is one of the most crucial challenges of autonomous driving vehicles, and one solution to guarantee safety is to employ an additional control revision module after the planning backbone. Control Barrier Function (CBF) has been widely used because of its strong mathematical foundation on safety. However, the incompatibility with heterogeneous perception data and incomplete consideration of traffic scene elements make existing systems hard to be applied in dynamic and complex real-world scenarios. In this study, we introduce a generalized control revision method for autonomous driving safety, which adopts both vectorized perception and occupancy grid map as inputs and comprehensively models multiple types of traffic scene constraints based on a new proposed barrier function. Traffic elements are integrated into one unified framework, decoupled from specific scenario settings or rules. Experiments on CARLA, SUMO, and OnSite simulator prove that the proposed algorithm could realize safe control revision under complicated scenes, adapting to various planning backbones, road topologies, and risk types. Physical platform validation also verifies the real-world application feasibility.</description>

      <title>An AI-driven multimodal smart home platform for continuous monitoring and intelligent assistance in post-stroke patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse monitoring and assistance needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns. A head-mounted eye-tracking module supports cognitive assessments and hands-free control of household devices, while ambient sensors ensure sub-second response times for interaction. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, protecting privacy and minimizing latency. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions-issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increases overall user satisfaction by an average of 115% (p&lt;0.01) compared to traditional home environment. Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable framework for patient-centered, long-term care in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven $H_{\infty}$ predictive control for constrained systems: a Lagrange duality approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a data-driven $H_{\infty}$ control scheme for time-domain constrained systems based on model predictive control formulation. The scheme combines $H_{\infty}$ control and minimax model predictive control, enabling more effective handling of external disturbances and time-domain constraints. First, by leveraging input-output-disturbance data, the scheme ensures $H_{\infty}$ performance of the closed-loop system. Then, a minimax optimization problem is converted into a more manageable minimization problem employing Lagrange duality, which reduces conservatism typically associated with ellipsoidal evaluations of time-domain constraints. The study examines key closed-loop properties, including stability, disturbance attenuation, and constraint satisfaction, achieved by the proposed data-driven moving horizon predictive control algorithm. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical simulations involving a batch reactor system, confirming its robustness and feasibility under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Rough Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle and an Indirect Shooting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</description>

      <title>Controlled Invariance in Fully Actuated Max-plus Linear Systems with Precedence Semimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a max-plus linear system and a semimodule, the problem of computing the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule is still open to this day. In this paper, we consider this problem for the specific class of fully actuated systems and constraints in the form of precedence semimodules. The assumption of full actuation corresponds to the existence of an input for each component of the system state. A precedence semimodule is the set of solutions of inequalities typically used to represent time-window constraints. We prove that, in this setting, it is possible to (i) compute the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule and (ii) decide the convergence of a fixed-point algorithm introduced by R.D. Katz in strongly polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Enabled Blockage-Aware Dynamic mmWave Multi-Hop V2X Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication offers unprecedented data rates and low latency, but faces significant reliability challenges due to signal blockages and limited range. This paper introduces a novel system for managing dynamic multi-hop mmWave V2X communications in complex blocking environments. We present a system architecture that integrates a mobility digital twin (DT) with the multi-hop routing control plane, providing a comprehensive, real-time view of the network and its surrounding traffic environment. This integration enables the control plane to make informed routing decisions based on rich contextual data about vehicles, infrastructure, and potential signal blockages. Leveraging this DT-enhanced architecture, we propose an advanced routing algorithm that combines high-precision environmental data with trajectory prediction to achieve blockage-aware mmWave multi-hop V2X routing. Our algorithm anticipates network topology changes and adapts topology dynamically to maintain reliable connections. We evaluate our approach through proof-of-concept simulations using a mobility DT of the Nishishinjuku area. Results demonstrate that our DT-enabled routing strategy significantly outperforms conventional methods in maintaining reliable mmWave V2X connections across various traffic scenarios, including fully connected and mixed traffic environments.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Safety Guarantees in Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of additional information sources into a Bayesian optimization framework while ensuring that safety constraints are satisfied. The interdependencies between these information sources are modeled using an unknown correlation matrix. We explore how uniform error bounds must be adjusted to maintain constraint satisfaction throughout the optimization process, considering both Bayesian and frequentist statistical perspectives. This is achieved by appropriately scaling the error bounds based on a confidence interval that can be estimated from the data. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark functions and a controller parameter optimization problem. Our results highlight a significant improvement in sample efficiency, demonstrating the methods suitability for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions.</description>
