      <title>Characterization of the first full-size production for ePIC TOF layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are characterized by a fast rise time (500 ps) and extremely good time resolution (down to 17 ps). The intrinsic low granularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for precise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs factories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider. AC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating oxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill factor and charge-sharing capabilities. Charge sharing between electrodes allows a hit position resolution well below the pitch/$\sqrt12$ of standard segmented detectors. At the same time, it relaxes the channel density and power consumption requirements of readout chips. Extensive laboratory characterization of AC-LGAD devices from the first full-size (up to 3x4 cm) production from HPK for ePIC will be shown in this contribution. Both pixel and strip geometry was produced and tested. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R&amp;D program at the EIC.</description>

      <title>{\alpha}/{\gamma} discrimination method for bulky BaF2 detector used in {\gamma} total absorption facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gamma-ray total absorption facility (GTAF) composed of 40 BaF2 detection units is designed to measure the cross section data of neutron radiation capture reaction online, in order to comply with the experimental nuclear data sheet.We have found that one of the most important sources of experimental background is the initial alpha particles emitted by the BaF2 crystal. Developing data analysis algorithms to eliminate the influence of alpha particles in experimental data has become a key aspect. In this work, in order to meet the needs of data acquisition, online measurement and analysis of neutron radiation cross section, the GTAF data acquisition system adopts a full waveform acquisition method, which results in a large number of data recorded, transmitted, and stored during experiment, which also affects the uncertainty of the cross-section data.Based on the signal waveform characteristics of the BaF2 detection unit, in order to solve the aforementioned problems, three methods, namely the ratio of fast component to total component, pulse width, and time decay constant, are used to identify and distinguish alpha particles and gamma rays. The quality factor FOM is utilized as an evaluation value and several experiments are conducted using three radioactive sources (22Na, 137Cs, 60Co) for verification.</description>

      <title>Development of a Hermetic Gaseous Xenon Detector for Suppressing External Radon Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radon-induced backgrounds, particularly from $^{222}$Rn and its beta-emitting progeny, present a critical challenge for next-generation liquid xenon (LXe) detectors aimed at probing dark matter down to the neutrino fog. To address this, we developed a compact hermetic gaseous xenon (GXe) detector. This device physically isolates the active volume from external radon sources by using a PTFE vessel sealed between two quartz flanges with mechanically compressed ePTFE gaskets. To quantify radon sealing performance, we implemented a dual-loop GXe circulation system and conducted a 670-hour radon-injection measurement campaign. Radon ingress into the hermetic detector was monitored using electrostatic radon detectors and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). From these two independent measurements, the steady-state ratios of the radon concentrations inside the hermetic detector to those outside were estimated to be $ (1.1 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-2} $ and $ (1.1 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-2} $, corresponding to radon-leakage flows of $ (2.9 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-11} $ and $ (2.6 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-11} $ $ \thinspace $m$^{3}$ $ \thinspace $ $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, respectively. An extrapolation to a 60-tonne LXe TPC such as XLZD suggests that the radon leakage could amount to $ 1.2 \times 10^{-2} $ $ \thinspace $mBq, which is negligible compared to the expected natural radon emanation inside the detector, typically 3$ \thinspace $mBq. These results demonstrate that flange-based mechanical sealing provides an effective solution for realizing radon-isolated inner detectors in large-scale LXe experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and development of optical modules for the BUTTON-30 detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BUTTON-30 is a neutrino detector demonstrator located in the STFC Boulby underground facility in the north-east of England. The main goal of the project is to deploy and test the performance of the gadolinium-loaded water-based liquid scintillator for neutrino detection in an underground environment. This will pave the way for a future large-volume neutrino observatory that can also perform remote monitoring of nuclear reactors for nonproliferation. This paper describes the design and construction of the watertight optical modules of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Radiation damage study of a p-type silicon sensor under extreme particle fluence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radiation tolerance of p-type silicon pad sensors, indigenously developed for use in high-fluence environments relevant to heavy-ion collider experiments, cosmic-ray observatories, and deep-space missions. Single-pad test structures were irradiated with neutrons over a range of fluence, and post-irradiation performance was characterized. The evolution of leakage current and the calorimetric response of the devices were systematically analyzed as functions of accumulated neutron fluence. In addition, we introduce a simple exponential-annealing model that predicts the time dependence of leakage current after irradiation. The measurements and model together quantify performance degradation and recovery trends, providing guidance for the design and operation of silicon-based calorimetry in harsh radiation environments.</description>

      <title>High-Q Superconducting Lumped-Element Resonators for Low-Mass Axion Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-frequency superconducting lumped-element resonators have recently attracted significant attention in the context of axion dark matter searches. Here we present the design and implementation of a fixed-frequency superconducting resonator operating near $250~\mathrm{kHz}$, possessing an inductor volume of $\sim 1$ liter and achieving an unloaded quality factor $Q \approx 2.1\times10^{6}$. This resonator represents a significant improvement over the state of the art and informs the design of searches for low-mass axions.</description>

      <title>Analytical Modeling of Asynchronous Event-Driven Readout Architectures Using Queueing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-driven imagers and sensor arrays commonly employ asynchronous arbiter trees with a synchronous acknowledge to serialize requests. We present an analytical framework that models the root as an \(M/D/1\) queue with deterministic quantum \(T\) and implements losses at the sources through one-slot gating. The admitted rate, loss probability, utilization, and mean sojourn time are coupled by self-consistent relations; a closed form for \(\mathbb{E}[S_t]\) separates fixed path delay \(\tau_0\) from queueing effects. The framework matches post-layout results of a physical prototype over light to heavy traffic, reproducing saturation at \(1/T\) and the observed latency growth, while classical \(M/G/1/K\) and Engset-type abstractions diverge at higher occupancy. Because all relations are algebraic, they enable rapid sizing at design time, including the impact of partitioning into independent tiles: reducing fan-in lowers arbitration depth and \(\tau_0\), decreases loss, and improves latency at fixed \(T\), with throughput adding across tiles. The model thereby links architectural parameters to performance metrics and supports selection of acknowledge period, tiling, and link count under practical constraints.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Wi-Fi Sensing Through Single Transceiver Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. We developed an AI-based Wi-Fi sensing system using a single transceiver pair and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization to validate the theoretical claims. The results confirm the performance gains contributed by temporal correlation and prior information.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Quantum Efficiency of Electrode Materials for VUV Photons in Liquid Xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light dark matter searches using ionization signals in dual-phase liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs) are limited by low-energy ionization backgrounds, including those from the photoelectric effect on the electrodes. To address this, we measured the quantum efficiency (QE) of various electrode materials for vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons in LXe, including platinum (Pt), stainless steel (SUS304), and magnesium fluoride (MgF$_{2}$)-coated aluminum (Al). Our results show that MgF$_{2}$-coated Al exhibits the lowest QE among the tested materials. The QE for VUV photons with a mean wavelength of 179.5~nm was measured to be $(7.2 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a reduction by a factor of 4.4 compared to SUS304, a commonly used electrode material in direct dark matter experiments with LXe. These findings suggest that employing low-QE electrodes can help mitigate photoelectric-induced backgrounds, potentially improving the sensitivity of LXe TPCs in light dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Neutron Interaction Properties of Structural Materials for Multi-Grid Neutron Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The T-REX neutron time-of-flight spectrometer at the European Spallation Source will use Multi-Grid Technology, which relies on thin B4C coatings on the Al blades of the grids to detect scattered thermal neutrons. Following a Monte Carlo study of internal shielding to suppress neutron multiple scattering in T-REX, the neutron transmission and scattering properties of 12 shielding-material samples have been measured at the ISIS spallation neutron source. Neutron transmission was measured on the EMMA beam line at wavelengths 0.5-4.7 A, using a 2D-position-sensitive, neutron GEM detector, while neutron scattering was measured for 6 of the samples at the Merlin spectrometer, at wavelengths 0.72, 1.28, 1.85 and 2.41 A. The present tests show that a B4C/Al composite material, plated with Ni to stop intrinsic alpha background, is an effective neutron absorber, suitable for incorporation in the Multi-Grid structures which detect the neutrons in inelastic neutron spectrometers .</description>
