      <title>A Limit in Law for the Cover Time and Last Visited Vertex of Wired Planar Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a scaling limit in law for the cover time of a simple random walk on a lattice version of a scaled-up planar domain with wired boundary conditions. The limiting distribution is that of a Gumbel Random Variable shifted randomly by an independent quantity which is equal to the full mass of a variant of the critical Liouville Quantum Gravity Measure on the same domain. We also derive a limit in law for the scaled location of the vertex visited last by the walk. Here the limit turns out to be precisely the critical Liouville Measure, normalized by its total mass. Both limits hold jointly with the limiting joint law explicitly described. These results resolve well known open problems in the field, in the case of wired boundary conditions. The proof is based on comparison with the extremal landscape of the discrete Gaussian Free Field, and in particular a version there-of obtained by conditioning the average value of the field to be zero.</description>

      <title>The Instability of all Backoff Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove Aldous's conjecture from 1987 that there is no backoff protocol that is stable for any positive arrival rate. The setting is a communication channel for coordinating requests for a shared resource. Each user who wants to access the resource makes a request by sending a message to the channel. The users don't have any way to communicate with each other, except by sending messages to the channel. The operation of the channel proceeds in discrete time steps. If exactly one message is sent to the channel during a time step then this message succeeds (and leaves the system). If multiple messages are sent during a time step then these messages collide. Each of the users that sent these messages therefore waits a random amount of time before re-sending. A backoff protocol is a randomised algorithm for determining how long to wait -- the waiting time is a function of how many collisions a message has had. Specifically, a backoff protocol is described by a send sequence $\overline{p} = (p_0,p_1,p_2,\ldots)$. If a message has had $k$ collisions before a time step then, with probability $p_k$, it sends during that time step, whereas with probability $1-p_k$ it is silent (waiting for later). The most famous backoff protocol is binary exponential backoff, where $p_k = 2^{-k}$. Under Kelly's model, in which the number of new messages that arrive in the system at each time step is given by a Poisson random variable with mean $\lambda$, Aldous proved that binary exponential backoff is unstable for any positive $\lambda$. He conjectured that the same is true for any backoff protocol. We prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the charged compact abelian lattice Higgs model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the (compact) abelian lattice Higgs model with charge \( k \geq 1 \) and show, using charged Wilson~loop observables and charged versions of the Marcu--Fredenhagen ratio, that this model exhibits several distinct phase transitions. In particular, we show that if \(k = 2\), then the Marcu--Fredenhagen ratio and Wilson~loop observables together can distinguish among three distinct phases of the parameter space, and hence both can be used as order parameters for the model.</description>

      <title>True self-repelling motion above a general barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The true self-repelling motion is a continuous-time random process which was introduced by T\'oth and Werner in 1998 to be a limit for the "true" self-avoiding random walk defined by T\'oth in 1995. The construction of the true self-repelling motion involves an uncountable system of coalescing Brownian motions starting from all points of the upper half-plane, related to the Brownian web, but reflected and absorbed on a "barrier" which is the abscissa axis. In this work, we consider much more general barriers, construct an uncountable system of coalescing Brownian motions reflected and absorbed on these barriers, and the true self-repelling motion associated to it. The extension of the proofs of T\'oth and Werner to this more general case is surprisingly difficult, especially when the barrier is irregular.</description>

      <title>TV over Bernoulli products: the small parameter regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the total variation distance (TV) between two $n$-fold Bernoulli product measures parametrized by $\vec p=(p_1,\ldots,p_n)$ and $\vec q=(q_1,\ldots,q_n)$, respectively, in the \emph{tiny} and \emph{small} regimes. In the tiny regime, we have $p_i,q_i\lesssim 1/n^2$, and in the small regime, $p_i,q_i\lesssim 1/n$. We discover that in the tiny regime, the TV distance behaves as $\|\vec p-\vec q\|_1$, while in the small regime, it behaves as \[ \sum_{i=1}^n \Big| p_i\prod_{j\neq i}(1-p_j) -
q_i\prod_{j\neq i}(1-q_j) \Big|, \] both up to absolute constants. Along the way we discover some identities of possible independent interest.</description>

      <title>Concentration for random Euclidean combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove concentration bounds for random Euclidean combinatorial optimization problems with $p$--costs. For bipartite matching and for the (mono- and bi-partite) traveling salesperson problem in dimension $d\ge 3$, we obtain concentration at the natural energy scale $n^{1-p/d}$ for $1\le p&lt;d^2/2$. Our method combines a Poincar\'e inequality with a robust geometric mechanism providing uniform bounds on the edges of optimizers. We also formulate a conjectural $p\!\to\!q$ transfer principle for the $p$--optimal matching which, if true, would extend the concentration range to all $p\ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Fractal dimension of singular times for SPDEs: Energy bounds, criticality, and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several physically relevant SPDEs, it is known that global weak solutions coexist with local strong ones. Typically, weak-strong uniqueness results are known, and ensure that the global and strong solutions coincide as long as the latter exist. Times at which a weak solution does not coincide with a strong one are called singular times. Determining their fractal dimension is fundamental to capturing the regularity of weak solutions.
  We define singular times for a wide class of semilinear SPDEs. We show that sets of singular times have fractal dimension (i.e., Hausdorff and/or Minkowski) at most $ 1-\ell\, \mathsf{Exc}$, where $\ell$ and $\mathsf{Exc}$ are the time integrability and the excess of spatial regularity compared to the critical regularity of the energy bound associated with weak solutions, respectively. Moreover, their corresponding $(1-\ell\,\mathsf{Exc} )$-dimensional measure is zero. We formulate and apply our theory to quenched strong Leray-Hopf solutions of 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with physically relevant noises, including rough Kraichnan and Lie transport. In particular, we extend the fundamental $1/2$-dimensional bound of Leray and Scheffer on singular times for 3D NSEs to the stochastic setting, and we prove new conditional results under supercritical Serrin's conditions, irrespective of the roughness of the noise. Our framework is new even in the deterministic case, and provides the first partial regularity results for weak solutions to SPDEs with multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>On the absence of time-translation symmetry breaking in some non-reversible interacting particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditions under which stochastic systems of infinitely many interacting particles can maintain sufficient spatial order to move coherently along a time-periodic orbit, thereby breaking the time-translation invariance of the underlying dynamical equation, have been an elusive issue. Via a free energy technique, we prove that if a non-reversible interacting particle system on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d=1,2$, with strictly positive rates admits a product measure as a stationary measure, then it cannot exhibit time-periodic behaviour. This provides a first step towards a general conjecture that time-periodic behaviour cannot occur in one- and two-dimensional systems with short-range interactions and constitutes the first result for non-reversible dynamics in dimension two.</description>

      <title>Detection, coverage and percolation in dynamic Boolean models with random radii based on $\alpha$-stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic network in continuum time and space in which nodes, with initial locations given by a Poisson point process, move according to i.i.d. isotropic $\alpha$-stable processes. Each node is additionally equipped with an i.i.d. detection radius. Inspired by corresponding results by Peres et. al. on mobile networks based on Brownian sausages with fixed width, we investigate the tail behaviour of three stopping times: The detection time of the first discovery of a designated node, the first coverage of an entire set, and the first discovery of a node by the infinite connected component of the system. Broadly speaking, we discover that the stability index as well as the random radii manifest themselves only in constants in the otherwise exponential decay rates. The proofs rest on heat-kernel bounds for the underlying L\'{e}vy processes and a detailed multiscale analysis allowing us to control the space-time correlations of the system.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Coulomb gases with multiple outposts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Coulomb gases in the presence of $m\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$ outposts. An outpost is a connected component of the coincidence set that lies outside the droplet.
  The case $m=1$ was previously investigated by Ameur, Charlier, and Cronvall. They showed that, as the total number of particles in the Coulomb gas tends to infinity, the number of particles accumulating near the outpost remains of order one and converges in distribution to the Heine distribution.
  In this work, we extend this analysis to the case of an arbitrary but fixed number $m$ of outposts. We prove that the joint distribution of the numbers of particles near the outposts converges to a multidimensional Heine distribution. Our results reveal a interesting phenomenon: although the outposts are geometrically disconnected, the particle count near each outpost is strongly correlated with the particle counts near all other outposts, not only the nearest ones (provided the outposts are not separated by a component of the droplet).</description>

      <title>A Cellular Representation of the Potts Lattice Higgs Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $i$-dimensional Potts lattice Higgs model is a random assignment of spins in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ to the $i$-dimensional cells of a cell complex induced by a Hamiltonian with a Potts interaction on the $(i+1)$-cells and an additional term playing the role of an external field. We develop a representation of this model as a pair of dependent plaquette percolations, and prove that Wilson line expectations can be expressed in terms of the probability of a topological event. As an application, we prove the existence of a phase transition for the Marcu--Fredenhagen ratio in the Potts lattice Higgs model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ when $i=1.$</description>

      <title>Yet another look at narrow escape through a tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The narrow escape problem concerns the time needed for a diffusing particle to exit a confining domain through a small hole in the boundary. While this problem is now well-understood, determining the escape time for a particle that must exit through a narrow tube has proven challenging. Indeed, relying on analogies with electrodynamics, parameter fits to simulations, and heuristics, a variety of conflicting estimates for this escape time have been offered over the last three decades, some of which are counterintuitive and arguably non-physical. In this paper, we combine matched asymptotic analysis and probabilistic methods to determine the exact asymptotics of the narrow escape time through a tube. We obtain a new escape time formula which reduces to the various prior estimates in certain special cases. If the diffusivity in the tube differs from the diffusivity in the rest of the domain, our results reveal the importance of the form of the multiplicative noise inherent to any diffusivity that varies in space. We discuss our results in the context of asymmetric cell division.</description>

      <title>A statistical model for points expanding in higher dimensions while being tied to bijective involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a set with $M$ elements, let $\psi :\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{M}$ be a bijective involution, and let~$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{\psi}$ be the set of sequences $(x_1,\dots,x_M)\in\mathcal{M}^M$ with the property that $x_{M+1-j} = \psi(x_j)$ for $1\le j\le M$. This framework can be used to infer the possible distribution of sequences, such as the modular ones, that pose challenges for conventional methods.
  We prove that when $M$ is even, there exists a limit probability density function that weighs the parameter $k$ that counts the appearances of the elements of $\mathcal{M}$ among the terms of sequences $\textbf{x}\in\boldsymbol{\mathcal{X}}_{\psi}$. It turns out that the number of fixed points of $\psi$ influences the probability density function, which decomposes into two pieces, each multiplied by complementary factors, and the smaller of the two pieces appears only when $k$ is even.
  Applying the model, we find a threshold from which almost all sequences contain related terms with prescribed frequencies.</description>

      <title>Exponential Concentration Inequalities For Independent Random Vectors Under Sublinear Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Li and Hu recently established variance-type O(1/n) bounds for the sample mean of independent random vectors under sublinear expectations. We extend their results to the exponential concentration regime. For bounded, independent R^d-valued random vectors under a regular sublinear expectation, we prove: (i) a general concentration principle that reduces vector-valued tail bounds to scalar martingale inequalities via a three-layer architecture; (ii) an Azuma-Hoeffding inequality showing that the distance from the sample mean to the Minkowski average of the expectation sets has sub-Gaussian tails; (iii) a Bernstein inequality incorporating the variance parameter of Li and Hu, interpolating between sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential regimes; (iv) a dimension-free bound replacing the exponential covering prefactor with a polynomial one via the matrix Freedman inequality; and (v) an explicit construction demonstrating that the sub-Gaussian rate is optimal. To the best of our knowledge, these constitute the first exponential concentration inequalities for the multivariate sample mean under sublinear expectations in terms of the set-valued distance to the Minkowski average.</description>

      <title>Quantitative propagation of chaos for 2D stochastic vortex model on the whole space under moderate interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the stochastic 2D vortex model on the whole Euclidean space from stochastic particle systems driven by individual and environmental noises, obtaining pathwise quantitative bounds in the sense of relative entropy. The main novelty is the application of the Donsker-Varadhan inequality in the context of moderately interacting particles to handle the nonlinearity, as well as the use of localization techniques combined with the probabilistic data setting, to derive estimates for the quadratic variation terms. Moreover, we prove the existence of a suitable solution to the aforementioned model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the limiting spectral measure of large random Helson matrices and large random matrices of certain patterned structures.
  Given a real random variable $X \in L^{2+ \varepsilon}(\mathbb{P}) $ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\mathrm{Var}(X) = 1$. For the random $n \times n$ Helson matrices generated by the independent copies of $X$, scaling the eigenvalues by $\sqrt{n}$, we prove the almost sure weak convergence of the spectral measure to the standard Wigner semi-circular law. Similar results are established for large random matrices with certain general patterned structures.</description>

      <title>Independent GUE minor processes of perfect matchings on rail-yard graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study perfect matchings on the rail-yard graphs in which the right boundary condition is given by the empty partition and the left boundary can be divided into finitely many alternating line segments where all the vertices along each line segment are either removed or remained. When the edge weights satisfy certain conditions, we show that the distributions of the locations of certain types of dimers near the right boundary converge to the spectra of independent GUE minor processes. The proof is based on new quantitative analysis of a formula to compute Schur functions at general points discovered in \cite{ZL18}.</description>

      <title>Fractional binomial distributions induced by the generalized binomial theorem and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a fractional extension of the classical binomial distribution and the associated Bernstein operator, formulated within the framework of the generalized binomial theorem (Hara and Hino [Bull.\ London Math.\ Soc. \textbf{42} (2010), 467--477]). This provides a new probabilistic structure not representable as the law of the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables. Despite this nonstandard nature, we establish several of its fundamental analytic and probabilistic properties, including limit theorems,through a unified framework based on the generalized binomial theorem.We further analyze the properties of the fractional Bernstein operator associated with the fractional binomial distribution. In particular, we prove that the iterates of the operator converge to a generalized Wright--Fisher diffusion semigroup after a proper diffusive rescaling.</description>

      <title>Empirical distribution of ancestral lineages in populations with density-dependent interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a density-dependent Markov jump process describing a population where each individual is characterized by a type, and reproduces at rates depending both on its type and on the population type distribution. We are interested in the empirical distribution of ancestral lineages in the population process. First, we exhibit a time-inhomogeneous Markov process, which allows to capture the behavior of a sampled lineage in the population process. This is achieved through a many-to-one formula, which relates the expected value of a functional evaluated over the lineages in the population process to the expectation of the functional evaluated along this time-inhomogeneous process. This provides a direct interpretation of the underlying survivorship bias, as illustrated on a minimalistic population process. Second, we consider the large population regime, when the population size grows to infinity. Under classical assumptions, the population type distribution converges to a deterministic limit. Here, we focus on the empirical distribution of ancestral lineages in this large population limit, for which we establish a many-to-one formula. Using coupling arguments, we further quantify the approximation error which arises when sampling in this large population approximation instead of the finite-size population process.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for non-local functionals of smooth Gaussian fields via quasi-association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many classical objects of study related to the geometry/topology of smooth Gaussian fields (e.g., the volume, surface area or Euler characteristic of excursion sets) have a `locality' property which is crucial to their analysis. More recently, progress has been made in studying `non-local' quantities of such fields (e.g., the component/nodal count or the Betti numbers of excursion sets). In this work, we develop a new approach to analysing non-local functionals based on a form of topological quasi-association. We use this to establish a variety of limit theorems for approximately additive functionals on growing domains, including concentration bounds, a quantitative central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the total variation distance under two information-erasing maps on inhomogeneous Bernoulli product measures: summation and homogenization. While summation is a Markov kernel and hence satisfies the usual data processing inequality, homogenization -- which maps each Bernoulli parameter to the cumulative mean -- is not. Nevertheless, we prove that the homogenization map also reduces the TV distance, up to a universal constant. The argument is based on an explicit two-sided control of the TV distance between Poisson binomials, obtained via a parameter interpolation and a second-moment extraction lemma.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to SDEs with singular drifts driven by fractional Brownian motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the strong well-posedness of SDEs with merely integrable time-dependent drifts driven by fractional Brownian motions with Hurst parameter H&lt;1/2. Our result holds over the entire subcritical regime and can be regarded as an extension of (Krylov and Rockner, Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 131(2): 154-196 (2005)) to the fractional case. Furthermore, we prove the existence of stochastic flows of Sobolev diffeomorphisms for this class of SDEs, which generalizes a result in (Mohammed et al., Ann. Probab. 43, 1535-1576 (2015)). The approach adopted in our work is based on a compactness criterion for random fields in Wiener spaces.</description>

      <title>Active operator learning with predictive uncertainty quantification for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increased prevalence of neural operators being used to provide rapid solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), understanding the accuracy of model predictions and the associated error levels is necessary for deploying reliable surrogate models in scientific applications. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) frameworks employ ensembles or Bayesian methods, which can incur substantial computational costs during both training and inference. We propose a lightweight predictive UQ method tailored for Deep operator networks (DeepONets) that also generalizes to other operator networks. Numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear PDEs demonstrate that the framework's uncertainty estimates are unbiased and provide accurate out-of-distribution uncertainty predictions with a sufficiently large training dataset. Our framework provides fast inference and uncertainty estimates that can efficiently drive outer-loop analyses that would be prohibitively expensive with conventional solvers. We demonstrate how predictive uncertainties can be used in the context of Bayesian optimization and active learning problems to yield improvements in accuracy and data-efficiency for outer-loop optimization procedures. In the active learning setup, we extend the framework to Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and describe a generalized method for other operator networks. To enable real-time deployment, we introduce an inference strategy based on precomputed trunk outputs and a sparse placement matrix, reducing evaluation time by more than a factor of five. Our method provides a practical route to uncertainty-aware operator learning in time-sensitive settings.</description>

      <title>Teachable normal approximations to binomial and related probabilities or confidence bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the usual normal approximations to binomial, hypergeometric, or Poisson interval probabilities, we collect some simple but then reasonably sharp error bounds. For the Clopper-Pearson~(1934) binomial confidence bounds, we present, following Michael Short's~(2023) approach, bounds similar to, but necessarily more complicated than, Lagrange's (1776) success rate plus/minus normal quantile times estimated standard deviation.
  The bounds, as presented here in four theorems, should be teachable, to people ranging from sufficiently advanced high school pupils to university students in mathematics or statistics: For understanding most of the proposed approximation results, it should suffice to know binomial laws, their means and variances, and the standard normal distribution function, but not necessarily the concept of a corresponding normal random variable.
  Accompanying technical remarks, references, and proofs are meant for assuring teachers or for stimulating further research.
  Of the proposed approximations, some are essentially well-known at least to experts, and some are based on teaching experience and research at Trier University.</description>

      <title>Estimating the growth rate of a birth and death process using data from a small sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the growth rate of a birth and death processes based on the coalescence times of a sample of $n$ individuals has been considered by several authors (\cite{stadler2009incomplete, williams2022life, mitchell2022clonal, Johnson2023}). This problem has applications, for example, to cancer research, when one is interested in determining the growth rate of a clone.
  Recently, \cite{Johnson2023} proposed an analytical method for estimating the growth rate using the theory of coalescent point processes, which has comparable accuracy to more computationally intensive methods when the sample size $n$ is large. We use a similar approach to obtain an estimate of the growth rate that is not based on the assumption that $n$ is large.
  We demonstrate, through simulations using the R package \texttt{cloneRate}, that our estimator of the growth rate performs well in comparison with previous approaches when $n$ is small.</description>

      <title>Minimax Rates for Learning Pairwise Interactions in Attention-Style Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in single-layer attention-style models, where tokens interact through a weight matrix and a nonlinear activation function. We prove that the minimax rate is $M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$, where $M$ is the sample size and $\beta$ is the H\"older smoothness of the activation function. Importantly, this rate is independent of the embedding dimension $d$, the number of tokens $N$, and the rank $r$ of the weight matrix, provided that $rd \le (M/\log M)^{\frac{1}{2\beta+1}}$. These results highlight a fundamental statistical efficiency of attention-style models, even when the weight matrix and activation are not separately identifiable, and provide a theoretical understanding of attention mechanisms and guidance on training.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.
