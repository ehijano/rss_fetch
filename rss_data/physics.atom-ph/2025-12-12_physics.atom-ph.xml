      <title>Search for a solar-bound axion halo using the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a search for a gravitationally bound solar axion halo using data from the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME), a worldwide array of magnetically shielded atomic magnetometers with sensitivity to exotic spin couplings. Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo. No statistically significant candidate signals are observed. We set 95% confidence-level upper limits on the amplitude of the axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field over the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 20 Hz, translating to constraints on the linear and quadratic axion-proton couplings for halo densities predicted by gravitational capture models and for the maximum overdensities allowed by planetary ephemerides. In the quadratic coupling case, our limits surpass existing astrophysical bounds by over two orders of magnitude across much of the accessible parameter space.</description>

      <title>Rapid all-optical loading of trapped ions using a miniaturised atom source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise an efficient optically-heated neutral atom source for ion trapping. We observe loading rates of up to $24(3)\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ with heating powers below $85\,\mathrm{mW}$, and demonstrate loading of a single ion in under $30\,\mathrm{s}$ with $41.4(4)\,\mathrm{mW}$ of optical power in a room-temperature ion trap system with an ionisation probability of $1.50(5)\times10^{-5}$. We calibrate a thermal model for the source's internal temperature by imaging the fluorescence of a collimated flux of neutral calcium that effuses from the oven at various optical heating powers. We show that the thermal performance of this oven is mainly limited by radiative losses. We explore the effect of second-stage photo-ionisation laser power on the loading rate, and identify a path beyond the loading rates reported in this study. We predict that this source is also well-suited to a wide range of metals used in ion-trapping.</description>

      <title>Bound-free electron-positron pair production in combined Coulomb and constant crossed electromagnetic fields: a Schwinger-like process with intrinsic assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bound-free channel of electron-positron pair production by a highly charged bare ion in the presence of a strong constant crossed electromagnetic field is studied. To calculate the pair production rate, two different methods are applied and compared with each other: (i) a quasiclassical tunneling theory and (ii) a strong-field approximation, both equipped with appropriate Coulomb correction factors. The resulting rate, which depends nonperturbatively on both the Coulomb field of the ion and the constant crossed field, is calculated in a broad range of applied field strengths and nuclear charge numbers. Its functional form resembles the rate for a dynamically assisted Schwinger-like process, with the assistance being provided by the atomic binding energy of the created electron.</description>

      <title>Rapid multi-mode trapped-ion laser cooling in a phase-stable standing wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to precise control and interrogation of atomic quantum systems. In the context of quantum computing and metrology with trapped ions, the integrated optical control of interest for scaling may additionally enable increased performance of coherent and incoherent operations. Here we utilize multi-channel integrated delivery of ultraviolet to infrared wavelengths required for calcium ion control including in passively phase-stable ultraviolet standing waves to demonstrate rapid, broadband laser cooling. We experimentally verify a long-standing prediction, realizing Doppler cooling to below the conventional Doppler limit at a standing-wave (SW) node. Utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), we experimentally cool motional modes spanning an approximately 5 MHz bandwidth from the Doppler temperature to near the ground state within 150 $\mu$s, reaching $\bar n \approx 0.05$ phonon number occupancies for the target mode. Direct evaluation against the comparable running-wave (RW) scheme shows the SW implementation's simultaneous advantage in cooling rate, motional mode bandwidth, and final phonon number as previously theoretically predicted. Our results demonstrate structured light's capability for robust ground-state laser cooling, and a clear advantage in a fundamental functionality enabled by scalable approaches to optical control.</description>

      <title>Tunable discrete quasi-time crystal from a single drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for exotic temporal orders in quantum matter, such as discrete quasi-time crystals (DQTCs), has become an important theme in nonequilibrium physics. However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter.</description>

      <title>Demonstration and frequency noise characterization of a 17 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the spectral performance of a novel continuous-wave room-temperature distributed feedback quantum cascade laser operating at the long wavelength of 17 $\mu$m. By demonstrating broadband laser absorption spectroscopy of the $\nu$2 fundamental vibrational mode of N2O molecules, we have determined the spectral range and established the spectroscopic potential of this laser. We have characterized the frequency noise and measured the line width of this new device, uncovering a discrepancy with the current consensus on the theoretical modeling of quantum cascade lasers. Our results confirm the potential of such novel narrow-line-width sources for vibrational spectroscopy. Extending laser spectroscopy to longer wavelength is a fascinating prospect that paves the way for a wide range of opportunities from chemical detection, to frequency metrology as well as for exploring light-matter interaction with an extended variety of molecules, from ultra-cold diatomic species to increasingly complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>General properties of the RABBITT at parity mixing conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity mixing in photoionization, i.e. when emitted electrons have different parities but the same energy, causes interference observable only in angle-resolved measurements. The interference typically manifests as a symmetry violation in the photoelectron angular distributions. The traditional, based on HHG, RABBITT scheme with high-order harmonics separated by twice the seed field energy, precludes parity mixing. On the contrary, a free-electron laser provides a possibility to generate even harmonics. Using triple the fundamental frequency as a seed, one obtains a comb of alternating even and odd harmonics, separated by three times the initial frequency [Nature 578, 386-391 (2020)] (2-SB RABBITT). In this setup, there are two sidebands between the main photoelectron lines, versus one in the traditional scheme. In the paper, we examine the general properties of a two-sideband scheme and analyze the symmetry breakdown of photoelectron angular distributions for various polarization geometries of the incident pulse. We found a crucial difference in symmetries between 2-SB RABBITT and other photoionization schemes with parity mixing. Illustrative calculations are carried out for neon with pulse parameters typical for modern facilities. The possibility to reconstruct the temporal profile of the pulse from the angle-resolved measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>Programmable Assembly of Ground State Fermionic Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic preparation of arbitrary two-component product states of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an 8$\times$8 optical tweezer array, achieving motional ground-state fidelities above $98.5\,\%$. Leveraging the large differential magnetic moments for spin-resolution, with parallelized site- and number-resolved control, our approach addresses key challenges for low-entropy quantum state engineering. Combined with high-fidelity spin-, site-, and density-resolved readout within a single $20\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ exposure, and $3\,\mathrm{s}$ experimental cycles, these advances establish a fast, scalable, and programmable architecture for fermionic quantum simulation.</description>
