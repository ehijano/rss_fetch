      <title>Atomic and Molecular Nitrogen Ions at the Dayside Magnetopause During the 2024 Mother's Day Storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion measurements made with the Hot Plasma Composition Analyzers of the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS-HPCAs) during the Mother's Day Storm (Gannon Storm) of 10-13 May 2024 yield the first observations of atomic and molecular nitrogen ions in the Earth's dayside outer magnetosphere. A population of ions identified as doubly charged nitrogen and oxygen was also measured. These observations were made within a highly compressed magnetosphere at a geocentric distance of ~6 Earth Radii during the early recovery phase of the storm. From the ion composition measurements and accompanying magnetic field data, we determine the reconnection rate at the magnetopause; we compare this result to a model reconnection rate that assumes the presence of only atomic oxygen and hydrogen. The heavy ion-laden-mass density in the magnetosphere was greater than the shocked solar wind mass density in the magnetosheath. Despite these conditions, magnetic reconnection still occurred at the magnetopause.</description>

      <title>Total Ionizing Dose Measurements in Small Satellites in LEO using LabOSat-01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LabOSat-01 is a payload designed to perform characterization experiments on electronic devices in hostile environments. Both Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components and custom nano and micro devices were studied in the last decade with this platform. The Total Ionizing Dose (TID) received by small satellites in Low Earth Orbit was measured with LabOSat-01 using p-MOSFET COTS and the results are presented in this work. Measurements were performed on two satellite missions, each totalling 1100 days, launched three years apart. Dosimeters were integrated in different satellite positions, with different shielding, and the measured TID after 1100 days ranged from 5 Gy to 19 Gy.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fermi acceleration with cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Data Calibration with Transformer Model Using Physical Constraints: A Scalable Method for Satellite Missions, Illustrated by Tianwen-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach that integrates the magnetic field data correction from the Tianwen-1 Mars mission with a neural network architecture constrained by physical principles derived from Maxwell's equation equations. By employing a Transformer based model capable of efficiently handling sequential data, the method corrects measurement anomalies caused by satellite dynamics, instrument interference, and environmental noise. As a result, it significantly improves both the accuracy and the physical consistency of the calibrated data. Compared to traditional methods that require long data segments and manual intervention often taking weeks or even months to complete this new approach can finish calibration in just minutes to hours, and predictions are made within seconds. This innovation not only accelerates the process of space weather modeling and planetary magnetospheric studies but also provides a robust framework for future planetary exploration and solar wind interaction research.</description>

      <title>Field Aligned Currents and Aurora During the Terrestrial Alfven Wing State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When sub-Alfvenic (Alfven Mach number M_ &lt; 1) plasmas impact Earth, the magnetosphere develops Alfven wings. A Multiscale Atmosphere Geospace Environment (MAGE) global simulation of the April 2023 geomagnetic storm, validated against Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), reveals the mechanism of field-aligned current (FAC) generation and auroral precipitation for the terrestrial Alfven wings. Simulation and observations show northern hemisphere planetward flowing auroral electrons (negative FAC) are predominantly at magnetic local times (MLTs) 8-12. Just before the wings formed, solar wind conditions were similar and M_A ~ 1.4, yet the same FAC system extended from 9-18 MLT. Flow vorticity drives FACs at the boundary of the Alfven wings and unshocked solar wind. The Alfven wing shape presents a different obstacle to the solar wind compared to typical lobe fluxes, producing the unique FAC and auroral patterns. New insights about Alfven wing FACs will help to understand auroral features for exoplanets inside their host star's Alfven zone.</description>

      <title>Comparing a radiation damage model for avalanche photodiodes through in-situ observation of CubeSat based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-based quantum technologies are essential building blocks for global quantum networks. However, the optoelectronic components used can be susceptible to radiation damage. Predicting long-term instrument performance in the presence of radiation remains a challenging part of space missions. We present a model that accounts for differences in radiation shielding and can predict the trends for dark count rates of space-based silicon Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (GM-APD). We find that the predicted trends are correlated with in-situ observations from GM-APDs on-board the SpooQy-1 CubeSat mission.</description>
