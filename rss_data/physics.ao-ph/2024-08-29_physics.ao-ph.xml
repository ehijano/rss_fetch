      <title>Evaluating near-surface wind speeds simulated by the CRCM6-GEM5 model using AmeriFlux data over North America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of various configurations of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM6-GEM5) in simulating 10-meter wind speeds using data from 27 AmeriFlux stations across North America. The assessment employs a hierarchy of error metrics, ranging from simple mean bias to advanced metrics that account for the dependence of wind speeds on variables such as friction velocity and stability. The results reveal that (i) the value of roughness length (z0) has a large effect on the simulation of wind speeds, (ii) using a lower limit for the Obhukov length instead of a lower limit for the lowest level wind speed seems to deteriorate the simulation of wind speeds under very stable conditions, (iii) the choice of stability function has a small but noticeable impact on the wind speeds, (iv) the turbulent orographic form drag scheme shows improvement over effective roughness length approach.</description>

      <title>High-Order harmonics of Thermal Tides observed in the atmosphere of Mars by the Pressure Sensor on the Insight lander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal tides are atmospheric planetary-scale waves with periods that are harmonics of the solar day. In the Martian atmosphere thermal tides are known to be especially significant compared to any other known planet. Based on the data set of pressure timeseries produced by the InSight lander, which is unprecedented in terms of accuracy and temporal coverage, we investigate thermal tides on Mars and we find harmonics even beyond the number 24, which exceeds significantly the number of harmonics previously reported by other works. We explore comparatively the characteristics and seasonal evolution of tidal harmonics and find that even and odd harmonics exhibit some clearly differentiated trends that evolve seasonally and respond to dust events. High-order tidal harmonics with small amplitudes could transiently interfere constructively to produce meteorologically relevant patterns.</description>

      <title>ClimDetect: A Benchmark Dataset for Climate Change Detection and Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and attributing temperature increases due to climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and guiding adaptation strategies. The complexity of distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability has challenged traditional detection and attribution (D&amp;A) approaches, which seek to identify specific "fingerprints" in climate response variables. Deep learning offers potential for discerning these complex patterns in expansive spatial datasets. However, lack of standard protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies. We introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset of over 816k daily climate snapshots, designed to enhance model accuracy in identifying climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in past research, ensuring comparability and consistency. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data, a novel and modernizing approach in this context. Our open-access data and code serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science through improved model evaluations. ClimDetect is publicly accessible via Huggingface dataet respository at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimDetect/ClimDetect.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>
