      <title>Enhanced optical properties of MoSe$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) like MoSe$_2$ exhibit remarkable optical properties such as intense photoluminescence (PL) in the monolayer form. To date, narrow-linewidth PL is only achieved in micrometer-sized exfoliated TMD flakes encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). In this work, we develop a growth strategy to prepare monolayer MoSe$_2$ on hBN flakes by molecular beam epitaxy in the van der Waals regime. It constitutes the first step towards the development of large area single crystalline TMDs encapsulated in hBN for potential integration in electronic or opto-electronic devices. For this purpose, we define a two-step growth strategy to achieve monolayer-thick MoSe$_2$ grains on hBN flakes. The high quality of MoSe$_2$ allows us to detect very narrow PL linewidth down to 5.5 meV at 13 K, comparable to the one of encapsulated exfoliated MoSe$_2$ flakes. Moreover, sizeable PL can be detected at room temperature as well as clear reflectivity signatures of A, B and charged excitons.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Quantitative Dynamic Fragmentation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed an image-based convolutional neural network (CNN) that is applicable for quantitative time-resolved measurements of the fragmentation behavior of opaque brittle materials using ultra-high speed optical imaging. This model extends previous work on the U-net model, where we trained binary, 3 and 5 class models using supervised learning on experimentally measured dynamic fracture experiments on various opaque structural ceramic materials that were adhered on transparent polymer (polycarbonate or acrylic) backing materials. Full details of the experimental investigations are outside the scope of this manuscript but briefly, several different ceramics were loaded using spatially and time-varying mechanical loads to induce inelastic deformation and fracture processes that were recorded at frequencies as high as 5 MHz using high speed optical imaging. These experiments provided a rich and diverse dataset that includes many of the common fracture modes found in static and dynamic fracture including cone cracking, median cracking, comminution, and combined complex failure modes that involve effectively simultaneous activation and propagation of multiple fragmentation modes. While the training data presented here was obtained from dynamic fragmentation experiments, this study is applicable to static loading of these materials as the crack speeds typically higher a kilometer per second in these materials are on the order of 1-10 km/s regardless of the loading rate. We believe the methodologies presented here will be useful in quantifying the failure processes in structural materials for protection applications and can be used for direct validation of engineering models used in design.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-Induced Boron Nitride Monolayers as Multifunctional Materials for Metal Ion Batteries and Hydrogen Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study comprehensively examined the structural, electronic, electrochemical, and energy storage properties of boron-vacancy induced porous boron nitride monolayers (BN:VB) as multifunctional materials, anodes for MIBs and H2 storage applications. Our computational approaches, density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and thermodynamic analysis, revealed exceptionally high energy and gravimetric densities for MIBs and H2 storage, respectively. We investigated the interactions of Li, Na, and K atoms on BN:VB, which strongly bonded with binding energies stronger than their bulk cohesive energies, which ensured structural stability and the absence of metal clustering. Electronic properties, analyzed through spin-polarized partial density of states (PDOS), band structure, and Bader charge analysis, revealed significant charge transfers from the metal atoms to BN:VB, enhancing the electronic conductivity of the latter. Theoretical specific capacities were calculated as 1821.53, 786.11, and 490.51 mA h/g for Li, Na, and K, respectively, which comfortably exceeded the conventional anodes, such as graphite. Average open-circuit voltages (OCVs) were found as 0.15, 0.25, and 0.32 V, for Li, Na, and K, respectively, indicating strong electrochemical stability. Diffusion studies showed lower barriers of 0.47, 0.08, and 0.60 eV for Li, Na, and K, respectively, with increased metal loadings, suggesting enhanced mobilities and charge/discharge rates. On the other side, the metal-functionalized BN:VB monolayers exhibited remarkably high H2 gravimetric capacities, supported by Langmuir adsorption model-based statistical thermodynamic analysis. Average adsorption energies of H2 on 4Li-, 4Na-, and 4K@BN:VB, were found in perfect range for practical storage applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal modification of ZrCu metallic glass nanolaminates: Structure and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of thermal treatments on metallic glass nanolaminates (NLs), with a composition of Zr$_{24}$Cu$_{76}$ and Zr$_{61}$Cu$_{39}$ and a bilayer period of 50 nm, were explored to control their mechanical properties through annealing-induced atomic structure modifications, structural relaxation, and partial crystallisation. Annealing treatments up to 330 {\deg}C ($T$ &lt; $T_g$, the glass transition temperature) maintain the amorphous structure of the NLs, while inducing atomic structural relaxation, densification, and free volume annihilation, reducing the formation of corrugations on fracture surfaces. Atom probe tomography measurements reveal that annealing at 330 {\deg}C for 60 mins also causes intermixing between layers, altering their compositions to Zr$_{44}$Cu$_{56}$ and Zr$_{55}$Cu$_{45}$ with increased mixing enthalpy. Moreover, the NLs exhibit superior thermal stability against crystallisation compared to their monolithic counterparts, remaining amorphous up to 420 {\deg}C, while the monolithic Zr$_{24}$Cu$_{76}$ and Zr$_{61}$Cu$_{39}$ films are crystalline at 390 {\deg}C, as a result of chemical interdiffusion and the heterogeneous NL structure of delaying the onset of crystallisation. Annealing treatments $T$ &gt; $T_g$ ($\sim$420 {\deg}C) induce partial crystallisation, forming Cu-Zr-based intermetallic and Zr-oxide phases, whereas annealing $T$ &lt; $T_g$ (330 {\deg}C) retains a visible layer structure. Nanoindentation analyses show a progressive increase in elastic modulus and hardness for higher annealing temperatures as a result of structural relaxation and likely nanocrystal formation, with a maximum hardness equal to 7.6 $\pm$ 0.2 GPa obtained after heat treatment at 420 {\deg}C for 60 mins and exceeding the rule-of-mixtures. These results highlight the potential of thermal treatments to tailor the structural, mechanical and thermal properties of metallic glass NLs.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect enhanced at magnetic transition fields in a frustrated magnet EuCd$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent magnetic fields exerted by topological spin textures of magnets lead to an additional Hall response of itinerant carriers called the topological Hall effect (THE). While THE as a bulk effect has been widely studied, THE driven by magnetic domain boundaries (DBs) has been elusive. Here, we report rich Hall responses characterized by multiple peak structures and a hysteresis loop in films of EuCd$_2$, where Eu layers form a geometrically frustrated lattice of Heisenberg spins. We uncover a THE component sharply enhanced at magnetic transition fields, indicating a giant contribution from non-trivial spin textures possibly formed at the DBs.</description>

      <title>Optical Spin Initialization of Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in a 28Si-Enriched 6H-SiC Crystal for Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-spin defect centers in crystal matrices are used in quantum computing technologies, highly sensitive sensors, and single-photon sources. In this work, optically active nitrogen-vacancy color centers NV in a 28Si-enriched (nuclear spin I = 0) 6H-28SiC crystal have been studied using the photoinduced (980 nm) high-frequency (94 GHz, 3.4 T) pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance method at a temperature of 150 K. Three structurally nonequivalent types of NV- centers with axial symmetry have been identified and their spectroscopic parameters have been determined. Long spin-lattice, T1=1.3 ms, and spin-spin, T2=59 us, ensemble relaxation times of NV- centers with extremely narrow (450 kHz) absorption lines allow highly selective excitation of resonant transitions between sublevels caused by the weak hyperfine interaction (A = 1 MHz) with 14N (I = 1) nuclei for the quantum manipulation of the electron spin magnetization.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of ZIF-4 Computed via Well-tempered Metadynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-tempered metadynamics simulations are employed to explore the phase diagram of ZIF-4, a porous crystalline metal-organic framework of industrial relevance. Despite the vast amount of experimental efforts, the phase diagram that includes ZIF-4 and its related polymorphs has not yet been fully determined. For example, the crystalline phase called ZIF-4-cp is not experimentally observed when high pressure ramps are applied. Our simulations shed light into the phase diagram topology and allow us to further look into the collective degrees of freedom that drive the phase transitions in the T=150-450 K and P=0-200 MPa region. The porous ZIF-4 phase transforms into ZIF-4-cp through pore closure, while the latter has a phase transition at higher pressures regimes to ZIF-4-cp-II, a transformation which involves subtle changes in swing dihedral angles.</description>

      <title>On the origin of univalent Mg$^+$ ions in solution and their role in anomalous anodic hydrogen evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous metal corrosion is a major economic concern in modern society. A phenomenon that has puzzled generations of scientists in this field is the so-called anomalous hydrogen evolution: the violent dissolution of magnesium under electron-rich (anodic) conditions, accompanied by strong hydrogen evolution, and a key mechanism hampering Mg technology. Experimental studies have indicated the presence of univalent Mg$^+$ in solution, but these findings have been largely ignored because they defy our common chemical understanding and evaded direct experimental observation. Using recent advances in the \emph{ab initio} description of solid-liquid electrochemical interfaces under controlled potential conditions, we described the full reaction path of Mg atom dissolution from a kinked Mg surface under anodic conditions. Our study reveals the formation of a solvated [Mg$^{2+}$(OH)$^-$]$^+$ ion complex, challenging the conventional assumption of Mg$^{2+}$ ion. This insight provides an intuitive explanation for the postulated presence of (coulombically) univalent Mg$^+$ ions and the absence of protective oxide/hydroxide layers normally formed under anodic/oxidizing conditions. The discovery of this unexpected and unconventional reaction mechanism is crucial for identifying new strategies for corrosion prevention and can be transferred to other metals.</description>

      <title>Observation of surface Fermi arcs in altermagnetic Weyl semimetal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a special type of collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM), altermagnetism has garnered significant research interest recently. Altermagnets exhibit broken parity-time symmetry and zero net magnetization in real space, leading to substantial band splitting in momentum space even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, parity-time symmetry breaking always induce nontrivial band topology such as Weyl nodes. While Weyl semimetal states and nodal lines have been theoretically proposed in altermagnets, rare reports of experimental observation have been made up to this point. Using ARPES and first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the electronic structure of the room-temperature altermagnet candidate CrSb. At generic locations in momentum space, we clearly observed band spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified discrete surface Fermi arcs on the (100) cleaved side surface close to the Fermi level originating from bulk band topology. Our results imply that CrSb contains interesting nontrivial topological Weyl physics, in addition to being an excellent room temperature altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Strength of 2D Glasses Explored by Machine-Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strengths of glasses are intricately linked to their atomic-level heterogeneity. Atomistic simulations are frequently used to investigate the statistical physics of this relationship, compensating for the limited spatiotemporal resolution in experimental studies. However, theoretical insights are limited by the complexity of glass structures and the accuracy of the interatomic potentials used in simulations. Here, we investigate the strengths and fracture mechanisms of 2D silica, with all structural units accessible to direct experimental observation. We develop a neural network force field for fracture (NN-F$^{3}$) based on the deep potential-smooth edition (DeepPot-SE) framework. Representative atomic structures across crystals, nanocrystalline, paracrystalline, and continuous random network glasses are studied. We find that the virials or bond lengths control the initialization of bond-breaking events, creating nanoscale voids in the vitreous network. However, the voids do not necessarily lead to crack propagation due to a disorder-trapping effect, which is stronger than the lattice-trapping effect in a crystalline lattice and occurs over larger length and time scales. Fracture initiation proceeds with void growth and coalescence, and advances through a bridging mechanism. The fracture patterns are shaped by subsequent trapping and cleavage steps, often guided by voids forming ahead of the crack tip. These heterogeneous processes result in atomically smooth facets in crystalline regions and rough, amorphous edges in the glassy phase. These insights into 2D crystals and glasses, both sharing SiO$_{2}$ chemistry, highlight the pivotal role of atomic-level structures in determining fracture kinetics and path selection in materials.</description>

      <title>Atomistic evolution of active sites in multi-component heterogeneous catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-component metal nanoparticles (NPs) are of paramount importance in the chemical industry, as most processes therein employ heterogeneous catalysts. While these multi-component systems have been shown to result in higher product yields, improved selectivities, and greater stability through catalytic cycling, the structural dynamics of these materials in response to various stimuli (e.g. temperature, adsorbates, etc.) are not understood with atomistic resolution. Here, we present a highly accurate equivariant machine-learned force field (MLFF), constructed from ab initio training data collected using Bayesian active learning, that is able to reliably simulate PdAu surfaces and NPs in response to thermal treatment as well as exposure to reactive H$_2$ atmospheres. We thus provide a single model that is able to reliably describe the full space of geometric and chemical complexity for such a heterogeneous catalytic system across single crystals, gas-phase interactions, and NPs reacting with H$_2$, including catalyst degradation and explicit reactivity. Ultimately, we provide direct atomistic evidence that verifies existing experimental hypotheses for bimetallic catalyst deactivation under reaction conditions, namely that Pd preferentially segregates into the Au bulk through aggressive catalytic cycling and that this degradation is site-selective, as well as the reactivity for hydrogen exchange as a function of Pd ensemble size. We demonstrate that understanding of the atomistic evolution of these active sites is of the utmost importance, as it allows for design and control of material structure and corresponding performance, which can be vetted in silico.</description>

      <title>Separating cationic and anionic redox activity in antiperovskite Li$_2$Fe)SO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-rich antiperovskite promise to be a compelling high-capacity cathode material due to existence of both cationic and anionic redox activity. Little is however known about the effect of separating the electrochemical cationic from the anionic process and the associated implications on the electrochemical performance. In this context, we report the electrochemical properties of the illustrative example of three different Li$_2$Fe)SO materials with a focus on separating cationic from anionic effects. With the high voltage anionic process, an astonishing electrochemical capacity of around 400~mAh/g can initially be reached. Our results however identify the anionic process as the cause of poor cycling stability and demonstrate that fading reported in previous literature is avoided by restricting to only the cationic processes. Following this path, our Li$_2$Fe)SO-BM500 shows strongly improved performance indicated by constant electrochemical cycling over 100 cycles at a capacity of around 175~mAh/g at 1~C. Our approach also allows us to investigate the electrochemical performance of the bare antiperovskite phase excluding extrinsic activity from initial or cycling-induced impurity phases. Our results underscore that synthesis conditions are a critical determinant of electrochemical performance in lithium-rich antiperovskites, especially with regard to the amount of electrochemical secondary phases, while the particle size has not been found a crucial parameter. Overall, separating and understanding the effects of cationic from anionic redox activity in lithium-rich antiperovskites provides the route to further improve their performance in electrochemical energy storage.</description>

      <title>Surface roughening in nanoparticle catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supported metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts are vital for the sustainable production of chemicals, but their design and implementation are limited by the ability to identify and characterize their structures and atomic sites that are correlated with high catalytic activity. Identification of these ''active sites'' has relied heavily on extrapolation to supported NP systems from investigation of idealized surfaces, experimentally using single crystals or supported NPs which are always modelled computationally using slab or regular polyhedra models. However, the ability of these methods to predict catalytic activity remains qualitative at best, as the structure of metal NPs in reactive environments has only been speculated from indirect experimental observations, or otherwise remains wholly unknown. Here, by circumventing these limitations for highly accurate simulation methods, we provide direct atomistic insight into the dynamic restructuring of metal NPs by combining in situ spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations powered by a machine learned force field. We find that in reactive environments, NP surfaces evolve to a state with poorly defined atomic order, while the core of the NP may remain bulk-like. These insights prove that long-standing conceptual models based on idealized faceting for small metal NP systems are not representative of real systems under exposure to reactive environments. We show that the resultant structure can be elucidated by combining advanced spectroscopy and computational tools. This discovery exemplifies that to enable faithful quantitative predictions of catalyst function and stability, we must move beyond idealized-facet experimental and theoretical models and instead employ systems which include realistic surface structures that respond to relevant physical and chemical conditions.</description>

      <title>Smart polymer solution and thermal conductivity: How important is an exact polymer conformation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat management in devices is a key to their efficiency and longevity. Here, thermal switches (TS) are of great importance because of their ability to transition between different thermal conductivity $\kappa$ states. While traditional TS are bulky and slow, recent experiments have suggested "smart" responsive (bio--inspired) polymers as their fast alternatives. One example is poly(N--isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) in water, where $\kappa$ drops suddenly around a temperature $T_{\ell} \simeq 305$ K when a PNIPAM undergoes a coil--to--globule transition. At a first glance, this may suggest that the change in polymer conformation has a direct influence on TS. However, it may be presumptuous to trivially "only" link conformations with TS, especially because many complex microscopic details control macroscopic conformational transition. Motivated by this, we study TS in "smart" polymers using generic simulations. As the test cases, we investigate two different modes of polymer collapse using external stimuli, i.e., changing $T$ and cosolvent mole fraction $x_{\rm c}$. Collapse upon increasing $T$ shows a direct correlation between the conformation and $\kappa$ switching, while no correlation is observed in the latter case. These results suggest that the (co--)solvent--monomer interactions play a greater important role than the exact conformation in dictating TS. While some results are compared with the available experiments, possible future directions are also highlighted.</description>

Abstract: Dimensionality significantly affects exciton production and condensation. Despite the report of excitonic instability in one-dimensional materials, it remains unclear whether these spontaneously produced excitons can form Bose-Einstein condensates. In this work, we first prove statistically that one-dimensional condensation exists when the spontaneously generated excitons are thought of as an ideal neutral Bose gas, which is quite different from the inability of free bosons to condense. We then derive a general expression for the critical temperature in different dimensions and find that the critical temperature increases with decreasing dimension. We finally predict by first-principles $GW$-BSE calculations that experimentally accessible single-chain staircase Scandocene and Chromocene wires are an antiferromagnetic spin-triplet excitonic insulator and a ferromagnetic half-excitonic insulator, respectively.</description>

      <title>Nematic Ising superconductivity with hidden magnetism in few-layer 6R-TaS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), the manipulation of interlayer stacking/coupling allows for the construction of customizable quantum systems exhibiting exotic physics. An illustrative example is the diverse range of states of matter achieved through varying the proximity coupling between two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin liquid (QSL) and superconductors within the TaS2 family. This study presents a demonstration of the intertwined physics of spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking, hidden magnetism, and Ising superconductivity in the three-fold rotationally symmetric, non-magnetic natural vdWHs 6R-TaS2. A distinctive phase emerges in 6R-TaS2 below a characteristic temperature (T*) of approximately 30 K, which is characterized by a remarkable set of features, including a giant extrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Kondo screening, magnetic field-tunable thermal hysteresis, and nematic magneto-resistance. At lower temperatures, a coexistence of nematicity and Kondo screening with Ising superconductivity is observed, providing compelling evidence of hidden magnetism within a superconductor. This research not only sheds light on unexpected emergent physics resulting from the coupling of itinerant electrons and localized/correlated electrons in natural vdWHs but also emphasizes the potential for tailoring exotic quantum states through the manipulation of interlayer interactions.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization of Landau levels driven by residual strain in the ZrSiS surface band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multi-valley electronic band structure, lifting of the valley degeneracy is associated with rotational symmetry breaking in the electronic fluid, and may emerge through spontaneous symmetry breaking order, or through a large response to a small external perturbation such as strain. In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sub-levels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley's Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to obtain each valley's dispersion curve and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample-dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of $ \lt 0.025 \% $. The extreme valley-polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as $ \sim 0.1 \% $ strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports the results presented in an invited poster during the International Conference on Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM) 2023 held in Sorrento, Italy. The suitability of scanning probe methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements is explored to investigate with high spatial resolution the elementary cell of 4H-SiC power MOSFETs. The two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional maps demonstrated a high spatial resolution of about 5 nm using the SSRM capabilities. Furthermore, the SCM capabilities enabled visualizing the fluctuations of charge carrier concentration across the different parts of the MOSFETs elementary cell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has emphasized the need for memristors with non-volatile, multiple conductance levels. This paper demonstrates the potential of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures to act as memristors with multiple resistance states that can be optically tuned using visible light. The number of resistance levels in graphene can be controlled by modulating doping levels, achieved by varying the electric field strength or adjusting the duration of optical illumination. Our measurements show that this photodoping of graphene results from the optical excitation of charge carriers from the nitrogen-vacancy levels of hBN to its conduction band, with these carriers then being transferred to graphene by the gate-induced electric field. We develop a quantitative model to describe our observations. Additionally, utilizing our device architecture, we propose a memristive crossbar array for vector-matrix multiplications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an atomistic classifier based on a combination of spectral graph theory and a Voronoi tessellation method. This classifier allows for the discrimination between structures from different minima of a potential energy surface, making it a useful tool for sorting through large datasets of atomic systems. We incorporate the classifier as a filtering method in the Global Optimization with First-principles Energy Expressions (GOFEE) algorithm. Here it is used to filter out structures from exploited regions of the potential energy landscape, whereby the risk of stagnation during the searches is lowered. We demonstrate the usefulness of the classifier by solving the global optimization problem of 2-dimensional pyroxene, 3-dimensional olivine, Au12, and Lennard-Jones LJ55 and LJ75 nanoparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a tensorial approach to the description of $\textbf{k}/-\textbf{k}$-symmetric, non-relativistic splitting of electronic bands in magnetic materials, which was recently given the name of 'altermagnetism'. I demonstrate that tensors provide a general framework to discuss magnetic symmetry using both spin groups and magnetic point groups, which have often been contrasted in recent literature. I also provide a natural classification of altermagnets in terms of the lowest-order tensorial forms that are permitted in each of the 69 altermagnetic point groups. This approach clarifies the connection between altermagnetism and well-known bulk properties, establishing that the vast majority of altermagnetic materials must also be piezomagnetic and MOKE-active, and provides a rational criterion to search for potential altermagnets among known materials and to test them when the magnetic structure is unknown or ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Unruh-DeWitt Quantum Computing: Realizing Quantum Shannon Theory With Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit-field quantum transduction provides numerous advantages to quantum computing, such as device-specific error-correcting codes, efficient scalability, and effective entanglement generation. An all-to-all connected bus of qubits implanted around the outside of a topological insulator, allowed to interact with the edge state, is a promising arena for transduction with flying fermionic qubits. Unruh--DeWitt detectors have allowed quantum information scientists to model entanglement properties of qubit-field interactions in many settings in a field known as Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). Unruh--DeWitt detectors are useful tools to realize quantum Shannon theory, a subset of the theory of quantum communication, in condensed matter systems, aptly named Unruh--DeWitt quantum computers. These systems will provide quantitative measurements of communication in quantum materials that utilize coherent states for bosonic and fermionic fields. In this thesis, emphasis is placed on the well-studied theory of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, as the bosonization of a helical Luttinger liquid provides a pedagogical arena to construct RQI channels of fermionic systems. Multiple experimentally realizable systems are proposed, and design constraints are constructed to ensure maximum channel capacity. Furthermore, we elucidate the strength of these quantum channels using measurements from quantum Shannon theory such as coherent information, dephasing formalism, diamond distance and universality of Unruh--DeWitt quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>Characterizing hydrogel behavior under compression with gel-freezing osmometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are particularly versatile materials that are widely found in both Nature and industry. One key reason for this versatility is their high water content, which lets them dramatically change their volume and many of their mechanical properties -- often by orders of magnitude -- as they swell and dry out. Currently, we lack techniques that can precisely characterize how these properties change with water content. To overcome this challenge, here we develop Gel-Freezing Osmometry (GelFrO): an extension of freezing-point osmometry. We show how GelFrO can measure a hydrogel's mechanical response to compression and osmotic pressure, while only using small, $O(100\mu$L$)$ samples. Because the technique allows measurement of properties over an unusually wide range of water contents, it allows us to accurately test theoretical predictions. We find simple, power-law behavior for both mechanical response to compression, and osmotic pressure, while these are not well-captured by classical Flory-Huggins theory. We interpret this power-law behavior as a hallmark of a microscopic fractal structure of the gel's polymer network, and propose a simple way to connect the gel's fractal dimension to its mechanical and osmotic properties. This connection is supported by observations of hydrogel microstructures using small-angle x-ray scattering. Finally, our results motivate us to propose an updated constitutive model describing hydrogel swelling, and mechanical response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-$T_c$ superconductivity (SC) was recently found in the bilayer material La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under high pressures. We study the bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model derived from the band structure of the La327. The model is solved by cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) with natural orbitals renormalization group (NORG) as impurity solver at zero temperature, considering only normal states. With hole doping, we have observed sequentially the Mott insulator (Mott), pseudogap (PG), non-Fermi liquid (NFL), and Fermi liquid (FL) phases, with quantum correlations decreasing. The ground state of the La327 is in the NFL phase with Hund spin correlation, which transmits the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ ($z$) orbital inter-layer AFM correlation to the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. When the $\sigma$-bonding state of the $z$ orbitals ($z+$) is no longer fully filled, the inter-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations weaken rapidly. At low pressures, the fully filled $z+$ band supports a strong inter-layer AFM correlations, potentially favoring short-range spin density wave (SDW) and suppressing SC. Hole doping at low pressures may achieve a similar effect to high pressures, under which the $z+$ band intersects with the Fermi level, and consequently the spin correlations weaken remarkably, potentially suppressing the possible short-range SDW and favoring SC.</description>

      <title>Inducing topological flat bands in bilayer graphene with electric and magnetic superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently argued that Bernal stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) exposed to a 2D superlattice (SL) potential exhibits a variety of intriguing behaviors [Ghorashi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 196201 (2023)]. Chief among them is the appearance of flat Chern bands that are favorable to the appearance of fractional Chern insulator states. Here, we explore the application of spatially periodic out-of-plane orbital magnetic fields to the model of Ghorashi et al. to find additional means of inducing flat Chern bands. We focus on fields that vary on length scales much larger than the atomic spacing in BLG, generating what we refer to as magnetic SLs. The magnetic SLs we investigate either introduce no net magnetic flux to the SL unit cell, or a single quantum of flux. We find that magnetic SLs acting on their own can induce topological flat bands, but richer behavior, such as the appearance of flat and generic bands with high Chern numbers, can be observed when the magnetic SLs act in conjunction with commensurate electric SLs. Finally, we propose a method of generating unit-flux-quantum magnetic SLs along with concomitant electric SLs. The magnetic SL is generated by periodic arrays of flux vortices originating from type II superconductors, while the electric SL arises due to a magnetic SL-induced charge density on the surface of a magnetoelectric material. Tuning the vortex lattice and the magnetoelectric coupling permits control of both SLs, and we study their effects on the band structure of BLG.</description>

      <title>Isospin Pomeranchuk effect and finite temperature resistivity minimum in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wave functions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. In rhombohedral graphene multilayers, in contrast, magnetism -- manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavors[1-7]-originates from fully itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here, we show that despite the absence of localized electronic orbitals on the scale of the interparticle separation, rhombohedral graphene bi- and trilayers show thermodynamic signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments. Specifically, while long range valley order vanishes at temperatures of a few Kelvin, thermodynamic characteristics of fluctuating moments, probed via both electronic compressibility[2-4] and exciton sensing measurements[8], survive to temperatures an order of magnitude higher. Measurements of the electronic entropy in this regime reveal a contribution of $\Delta S \approx 1k_B$/charge carrier, onsetting at the Curie temperature, while first order phase transitions show an isospin "Pomeranchuk effect" in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favored over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid[9, 10]. Our results imply that despite the itinerant nature of the electron wave functions, the spin- and valley polarization of individual electrons are decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He[11]. Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite temperature resistance minimum within the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two dimensional flat band systems and their possible relevance both to low-temperature ground states and high temperature transport anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractal lattices, featuring the self-similarity symmetry, are often geometric descents of parent crystals, possessing all their discrete symmetries (such as rotations and reflections) except the translational ones. Here, we formulate three different general approaches to construct real space Hamiltonian on a fractal lattice starting from the Bloch Hamiltonian on the parent crystal, fostering for example strong and crystalline topological insulators resulting from the interplay between the nontrivial geometry of the underlying electronic wavefunctions and the crystal symmetries. As a demonstrative example, we consider a generalized square lattice Chern insulator model, and within the framework of all three methods we successfully showcase incarnations of strong and crystalline Chern insulators on the Sierpi\'nski carpet fractal lattices. The proposed theoretical framework thus lays a generic foundation to build a tower of topological phases on the landscape of fractal lattices.</description>

      <title>Predicting Phase Transitions in PbTiO$_3$ using Zentropy through Quasi-Harmonic Phonon Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, PbTiO$_3$ undergoes a phase transition from a tetragonal ferroelectric phase to a cubic paraelectric phase at 763 K. However, X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements indicate that PbTiO$_3$ is locally tetragonal even after the phase transition. The difference in these results is because XAFS measurements can probe local features of a structure, while XRD averages over such local features. For both measurements to be consistent, PbTiO$_3$ is macroscopically cubic but locally tetragonal after the phase transition. Despite this, most models, such as the Laundau-Ginsburg-Devonshire theory and effective Hamiltonians, are still unable to explain this phenomenon. Moreover, these methods involve model parameters fitted to experimental or theoretical data and do not consider other tetragonal configurations, such as domain walls, to predict the phase transition. Our previous study used our novel zentropy approach to predict the phase transition by considering the tetragonal ferroelectric ground state configuration and the tetragonal 90{\deg} and 180{\deg} domain wall configurations with their total energies at 0 K. In the present work, the Helmholtz energies of the three configurations are obtained from density functional theory calculations through energy-volume curves and phonon calculations. The predicted phase transition temperature using the meta-GGA $r^2\text{SCAN}$ and revised multiplicities of configurations is 716 K, showing good agreement with the experimental value of 763 K.</description>

      <title>Emergent impervious band crossing in the bulk in topological nodal line semimetal ZrAs$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological nodal-line semimetals represent a unique class of materials with intriguing electronic structures and rich of symmetries, hosting electronic states with nontrivial topological properties. Among these, ZrAs$_2$ stands out, characterized by its nodal lines in a momentum space, governed by nonsymmorphic symmetries. This study integrates angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the electronic states of ZrAs$_2$. Our study provides experimental evidence of nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band crossing and nodal lines in ZrAs$_2$. In ARPES scans, we observed a distinctive surface and bulk states at different photon energies associated with nodal lines. Our results, supported by calculations based on DFT, unveil such impervious band crossing anchored at specific points in the Brillouin zone, with particular emphasis on the S point. Surface bands and bulk states near the crossing are elucidated through slab calculations, corroborating experimental findings. These findings enhance our understanding of the electronic structure of ZrAs$_2$.</description>

      <title>Half century of Efros-Shklovskii Coulomb gap. Romance with Coulomb interaction and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19793v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efros-Shklovskii (ES) Coulomb gap in density of localized states and ES law of the variable range hopping conductivity were coined 50 years ago. The theory and its first confirmations were reviewed in our monograph 40-years ago. This paper reviews the subsequent experimental evidence, theoretical advancements, and novel applications. Out of hundreds of experimental validations of the ES law in a diverse range of materials, I focus on those where the dynamic range of conductivity exceeds four orders of magnitude. These include three- and two-dimensional semiconductors under both zero and high magnetic fields, localized phases in the quantum Hall effect, granular metals, nanocrystal arrays, and conducting polymers. Additionally, this review discusses the Coulomb gap near insulator-metal transition and in non-ohmic ES law. Recent developments of other concepts of the ES book are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Radial distribution and its spherical harmonics expansion in liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar based on pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using Kihara Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the radial distribution function of liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar and its expansion coefficients by spherical harmonics as a function of intermolecular distance up to 20 angstroms for all possible combinations of angular indices l, l prime, and m less than or equal to 8, in contrast to past works of limited combinations. The positions and orientations of CO2 molecules were determined by pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using a Kihara potential model. It was found that the radial distribution function had an intense peak at 4.05 angstroms and a broad band at around 7.85 angstroms. The expansion coefficients had prominent structures below approximately 7.5 angstroms, showing positive and/or negative peaks, which indicated that the orientational correlations of the central molecule were intense with the molecules present in that region. It was also found that the peaks of some expansion coefficients were not small even when l = 8. The implication of the values of the expansion coefficients as well as their positive/negative peaks, relating to orientational correlation, are yet to be investigated further.</description>

      <title>On Exchange-Correlation Energy in DFT Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the considerable importance of material properties in modern condensed matter physics research, and using techniques of the $N_{e}$ -electron systems in terms of the electron density $n_{\sigma e}\left( r\right) $ needed to obtain the ground-state energy $E_{e}$ in Density Functional Theory scenarios, we approach the Exchange-Correlation energy $ E_{xc}\left[ n_{\sigma e}(r)\right] $ by considering the interelectronic position corrections $\Delta r_{x}^{\uparrow \uparrow ,\uparrow \downarrow }=\lambda _{x}\left\vert \delta r^{\uparrow \uparrow }-\delta r^{\uparrow \downarrow }\right\vert $ and $\Delta r_{c}^{e_{i}e_{j\neq i}}=\lambda _{c}\left\vert r-r^{\prime }\right\vert ^{-\left( N_{e}-1\right) ^{-1}}$ corresponding to the spin and the Coulomb correlation effects, respectively, through the electron-electron potential energy. Exploiting such corrections, we get approximate expressions for the exchange $E_{x}\left[ n_{\sigma e} \right] $ and the correlation $E_{c}\left[ n_{\sigma e}\right] $ functional energies which could be interpreted in terms of magnetic and electric dipole potential energies associated with the charge density $n_{\sigma e}\left( r\right) $ described by inverse-square potential behaviors. Based on these arguments, we expect that such obtained Exchange-Correlation functional energy could be considered in the Local Density Approximation functional as an extension to frame such interelectronic effects.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric AlBN Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the properties of molecular beam epitaxy deposited AlBN thin films on a recently developed epitaxial nitride metal electrode Nb2N. While a control AlN thin film exhibits standard capacitive behavior, distinct ferroelectric switching is observed in the AlBN films with increasing Boron mole fraction. The measured remnant polarization Pr of 15 uC/cm2 and coercive field Ec of 1.45 MV/cm in these films are smaller than those recently reported on films deposited by sputtering, due to incomplete wake-up, limited by current leakage. Because AlBN preserves the ultrawide energy bandgap of AlN compared to other nitride hi-K dielectrics and ferroelectrics, and it can be epitaxially integrated with GaN and AlN semiconductors, its development will enable several opportunities for unique electronic, photonic, and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Direct Nanopatterning of Complex 3D Surfaces and Self-Aligned Superlattices via Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional lithography methods involving pattern transfer through resist templating face challenges of material compatibility with various process solvents. Other approaches of direct material writing often compromise pattern complexity and overlay accuracy. Here we explore a concept based on the moir\'e interference of molecular beams to directly pattern complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces made by any evaporable materials, such as metals, oxides and organic semiconductors. Our proposed approach, termed the Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography (MBHL), relies on precise control over angular projections of material flux passing through nanoapertures superimposed on the substrate, emulating the interference of coherent laser beams in interference lithography. Incorporating with our computational lithography (CL) algorithm, we have demonstrated self-aligned overlay of multiple material patterns to yield binary up to quinary superlattices, with a critical dimension and overlay accuracy on the order of 50 and 2 nanometers, respectively. The process is expected to substantially expand the boundary of materials combination for high-throughput fabrication of complex superstructures of translational symmetry on arbitrary substrates, enabling new nanoimaging, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks for Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the potential of self-supervised learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for electron microscopy datasets. We show how self-supervised pretraining facilitates efficient fine-tuning for a spectrum of downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, denoising, noise \&amp; background removal, and super-resolution. Experimentation with varying model complexities and receptive field sizes reveals the remarkable phenomenon that fine-tuned models of lower complexity consistently outperform more complex models with random weight initialization. We demonstrate the versatility of self-supervised pretraining across various downstream tasks in the context of electron microscopy, allowing faster convergence and better performance. We conclude that self-supervised pretraining serves as a powerful catalyst, being especially advantageous when limited annotated data are available and efficient scaling of computational cost is important.</description>

      <title>Van-Hove annihilation and nematic instability on a Kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel states of matter arise in quantum materials due to strong interactions among electrons. A nematic phase breaks the point group symmetry of the crystal lattice and is known to emerge in correlated materials. Here we report the observation of an intra-unit-cell nematic order and signatures of Pomeranchuk instability in the Kagome metal ScV6Sn6. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we reveal a stripe-like nematic order breaking the crystal rotational symmetry within the Kagome lattice itself. Moreover, we identify a set of van Hove singularities adhering to the Kagome layer electrons, which appear along one direction of the Brillouin zone while being annihilated along other high-symmetry directions, revealing a rotational symmetry breaking. Via detailed spectroscopic maps, we further observe an elliptical deformation of Fermi surface, which provides direct evidence for an electronically mediated nematic order. Our work not only bridges the gap between electronic nematicity and Kagome physics, but also sheds light on the potential mechanism for realizing symmetry-broken phases in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>
