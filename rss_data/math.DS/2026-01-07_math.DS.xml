      <title>Affine mappings of translation surfaces: shrinking targets and Diophantine properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a translation surface whose Veech group $\Gamma$ is a lattice. We prove that the generic orbit of the group of affine homeomorphisms of $(X,\omega)$ can be used to approximate each point of $X$ with Diophantine precision. The proof utilizes an induced $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$-action on a fiber bundle $Y$ whose base is $SL_2(\mathbb{R})/\Gamma$ and whose fiber is $X$. We observe that this bundle embeds as an $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$-orbit closure in the moduli space of once marked translation surfaces, and hence we may invoke the spectral gap results of Avila and Gou\"ezel and a quantitative mean ergodic theorem for the $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$-action on the mean-zero, square-integrable functions on $Y$.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Global Bifurcations and Chaos in a Mechanical System under Delayed and Quantized Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate how the recent theory of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) can capture global bifurcations and complex dynamics in mechanical systems even under delay and spatial discretization. Specifically, we build a parameter-dependent SSM-reduced model that predicts global heteroclinic and local bifurcations in a Furuta pendulum under control with delay, and verify these predictions numerically. Under additional spatial discretization of the digital controller, we also obtain an SSM-reduced model that correctly reproduces a numerically and experimentally observed microchaotic attractor in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an analog of Rudolph's theorem for actions of countable amenable groups, which asserts that among invariant measures with entropy at least c on the $G$-shift $(\Lambda^G,\sigma)$, a typical measure has entropy $c$ and is Bernoulli. We also address a relative version of this theorem.</description>

      <title>Normalization flow and Poincar\'e-Dulac theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new approach to the Poincar\'e--Dulac normal form theory for a system of differential equations near a singular point. Using the continuous averaging method, we construct a normalization flow that moves a vector field to its normal form. We prove that, in the algebra of formal vector fields (given by power series), the normalization procedure achieves full normalization. When convergence is taken into account, we show that the radius of convergence admits a lower bound of order $1/(1+A\delta)$, with $A&gt;0$, as $\delta \to +\infty$. Based on the methods of this work and on the approaches of \cite{Tres2}, we provide a new proof of the Siegel--Brjuno theorem on the convergence of the normalizing transformation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Spectral Modeling and Control of Soft-Robotic Muscles from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial muscles are essential for compliant musculoskeletal robotics but complicate control due to nonlinear multiphysics dynamics. Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Reduction of Transfer Operators for Particle Clustering Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operator-based framework to coarse-grain interacting particle systems that exhibit clustering dynamics. Starting from the particle-based transfer operator, we first construct a sequence of reduced representations: the operator is projected onto concentrations and then further reduced by representing the concentration dynamics on a geometric low-dimensional manifold and an adapted finite-state discretization. The resulting coarse-grained transfer operator is finally estimated from dynamical simulation data by inferring the transition probabilities between the Markov states. Applied to systems with multichromatic and Morse interaction potentials, the reduced model reproduces key features of the clustering process, including transitions between cluster configurations and the emergence of metastable states. Spectral analysis and transition-path analysis of the estimated operator reveal implied time scales and dominant transition pathways, providing an interpretable and efficient description of particle-clustering dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fast Surrogate Models for Adaptive Aircraft Trajectory Prediction in En route Airspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources.
  This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.</description>

      <title>Values of ternary quadratic forms at integers and the Berry-Tabor conjecture for 3-tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berry and Tabor conjectured in 1977 that spectra of generic integrable quantum systems have the same local statistics as a Poisson point process. We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})^3\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.</description>

      <title>A Host--Kra ${\mathbf F}_2^\omega$-system of order $5$ that is not Abramov of order $5$, and non-measurability of the inverse theorem for the $U^6({\mathbf F}_2^n)$ norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04853v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was conjectured by Bergelson, Tao, and Ziegler \cite{btz} that every Host--Kra $\F_p^\omega$-system of order $k$ is an Abramov system of order $k$. This conjecture has been verified for $k \leq p+1$. In this paper we show that the conjecture fails when $k=5, p=2$. We in fact establish a stronger (combinatorial) statement, in that we produce a bounded function $f: \F_2^n \to \C$ of large Gowers norm $\|f\|_{U^6(\F_2^n)}$ which (as per the inverse theorem for that norm) correlates with a non-classical quintic phase polynomial $e(P)$, but with the property that all such phase polynomials $e(P)$ are ``non-measurable'' in the sense that they cannot be well approximated by functions of a bounded number of random translates of $f$. A simpler version of our construction can also be used to answer a question of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy \cite{CGSS}.</description>

Abstract: We prove that infinite mapping class group orbits are dense in the character variety of Deroin-Tholozan representations. In other words, the action is minimal except for finite orbits. Our arguments rely on the symplectic structure of the character variety, emphasizing this geometric perspective over its algebraic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a one-step matrix cocycle generated by a pair of non-negative parabolic matrices and study the equilibrium measures for $t\log \|\mathcal A\|$ as $t$ runs over the reals. We show that there is a freezing first order phase transition at some parameter value $t_c$ so that for $t&lt;t_{c}$ the equilibrium measure is non-unique and supported on the two fixed points, while for $t&gt;t_c$, the equilibrium measure is unique, non-atomic and fully supported. The phase transition closely resembles the classical Hofbauer example. In particular, our example shows that there may be non-unique equilibrium measures for negative $t$ even if the cocycle is strongly irreducible and proximal.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory on clustering in spontaneous particle aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of short-term and long-term memory on spontaneous aggregation of organisms is investigated using a stochastic agent-based model. Each individual modulates the amplitude of its random motion according to the perceived local density of neighbors. Memory is introduced via a chain of $K$~internal variables that allow agents to retain information about previously encountered densities. The parameter $K$ controls the effective length of memory. A formal mean-field limit yields a macroscopic Fokker--Planck equation, which provides a continuum description of the system in the large-population limit. Steady states of this equation are characterized to interpret the emergence and morphology of clusters. Systematic stochastic simulations in one- and two-dimensional spatial domains reveal that short- or moderate-term memory promotes coarsening, resulting in a smaller number of larger clusters, whereas long-term memory inhibits aggregation and increases the proportion of isolated individuals. Statistical analysis demonstrates that extended memory reduces the agents' responsiveness to environmental stimuli, explaining the transition from aggregation to dispersion as $K$ increases. These findings identify memory as a key factor controlling the collective organization of self-driven agents and provide a bridge between individual-level dynamics and emergent spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>At the Intersection of Deep Sequential Model Framework and State-space Model Framework: Study on Option Pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference and forecast problems of the nonlinear dynamical system have arisen in a variety of contexts. Reservoir computing and deep sequential models, on the one hand, have demonstrated efficient, robust, and superior performance in modeling simple and chaotic dynamical systems. However, their innate deterministic feature has partially detracted their robustness to noisy system, and their inability to offer uncertainty measurement has also been an insufficiency of the framework. On the other hand, the traditional state-space model framework is robust to noise. It also carries measured uncertainty, forming a just-right complement to the reservoir computing and deep sequential model framework. We propose the unscented reservoir smoother, a model that unifies both deep sequential and state-space models to achieve both frameworks' superiorities. Evaluated in the option pricing setting on top of noisy datasets, URS strikes highly competitive forecasting accuracy, especially those of longer-term, and uncertainty measurement. Further extensions and implications on URS are also discussed to generalize a full integration of both frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

      <title>The Lagrangian and symplectic structures of the Kuramoto oscillator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being under intense scrutiny for 50 years, the Kuramoto oscillator model has remained a quintessential representative of non-equilibrium phase transitions. One of the reasons for its enduring relevance is the apparent lack of an optimization formulation, due to the fact that (superficially), the equations of motion seem to not be compatible with a Lagrangian structure. We show that, as a mean-field classical (twisted) spin model on $S^2$, the Kuramoto model can be described variationaly. Based on this result perturbation analysis around (unstable) Kuramoto equilibria are shown to be equivalent to low-energy fluctuations of mean-field Heisenberg spin models. Intriguingly, off-plane perturbations around these equilibria configurations turn out to be described by a semiclassical Gaudin model, pointing to the fact that oscillator synchronization maps to the spin pairing mechanism investigated by Richardson and subsequently by others.</description>
