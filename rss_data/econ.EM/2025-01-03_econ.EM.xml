      <title>Regression discontinuity aggregation, with an application to the union effects on inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the regression discontinuity (RD) design to settings where each unit's treatment status is an average or aggregate across multiple discontinuity events. Such situations arise in many studies where the outcome is measured at a higher level of spatial or temporal aggregation (e.g., by state with district-level discontinuities) or when spillovers from discontinuity events are of interest. We propose two novel estimation procedures - one at the level at which the outcome is measured and the other in the sample of discontinuities - and show that both identify a local average causal effect under continuity assumptions similar to those of standard RD designs. We apply these ideas to study the effect of unionization on inequality in the United States. Using credible variation from close unionization elections at the establishment level, we show that a higher rate of newly unionized workers in a state-by-industry cell reduces wage inequality within the cell.</description>

      <title>Panel Estimation of Taxable Income Elasticities with Heterogeneity and Endogenous Budget Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an estimator for the average of heterogeneous elasticities of taxable income (ETI), addressing key econometric challenges posed by nonlinear budget sets. Building on an isoelastic utility framework, we derive a linear-in-logs taxable income specification that incorporates the entire budget set while allowing for individual-specific ETI and productivity growth. To account for endogenous budget sets, we employ panel data and estimate individual-specific ridge regressions, constructing a debiased average of ridge coefficients to obtain the average ETI.</description>

      <title>Copula Central Asymmetry of Equity Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial crises are usually associated with increased cross-sectional dependence between asset returns, causing asymmetry between the lower and upper tail of return distribution. The detection of asymmetric dependence is now understood to be essential for market supervision, risk management, and portfolio allocation.
  I propose a non-parametric test procedure for the hypothesis of copula central symmetry based on the Cram\'er-von Mises distance of the empirical copula and its survival counterpart, deriving the asymptotic properties of the test under standard assumptions for stationary time series. I use the powerful tie-break bootstrap that, as the included simulation study implies, allows me to detect asymmetries with up to 25 series and the number of observations corresponding to one year of daily returns. Applying the procedure to US portfolio returns separately for each year in the sample shows that the amount of copula central asymmetry is time-varying and less present in the recent past. Asymmetry is more critical in portfolios based on size and less in portfolios based on book-to-market and momentum. In portfolios based on industry classification, asymmetry is present during market downturns, coherently with the financial contagion narrative.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Socio-Economic Challenges and Technological Progress on Economic Inequality: An Estimation with the Perelman Model and Ricci Flow Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article examines the impact of 16 key parameters of the Georgian economy on economic inequality, using the Perelman model and Ricci flow mathematical methods. The study aims to conduct a deep analysis of the impact of socio-economic challenges and technological progress on the dynamics of the Gini coefficient. The article examines the following parameters: income distribution, productivity (GDP per hour), unemployment rate, investment rate, inflation rate, migration (net negative), education level, social mobility, trade infrastructure, capital flows, innovative activities, access to healthcare, fiscal policy (budget deficit), international trade (turnover relative to GDP), social protection programs, and technological access. The results of the study confirm that technological innovations and social protection programs have a positive impact on reducing inequality. Productivity growth, improving the quality of education, and strengthening R&amp;D investments increase the possibility of inclusive development. Sensitivity analysis shows that social mobility and infrastructure are important factors that affect economic stability. The accuracy of the model is confirmed by high R^2 values (80-90%) and the statistical reliability of the Z-statistic (&lt;0.05). The study uses Ricci flow methods, which allow for a geometric analysis of the transformation of economic parameters in time and space. Recommendations include the strategic introduction of technological progress, the expansion of social protection programs, improving the quality of education, and encouraging international trade, which will contribute to economic sustainability and reduce inequality. The article highlights multifaceted approaches that combine technological innovation and responses to socio-economic challenges to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic development.</description>

      <title>Min(d)ing the President: A text analytic approach to measuring tax news</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic agents react to signals about future tax policy changes. Consequently, estimating their macroeconomic effects requires identification of such signals. We propose a novel text analytic approach for transforming textual information into an economically meaningful time series. Using this method, we create a tax news measure from all publicly available post-war communications of U.S. presidents. Our measure predicts the direction and size of future tax changes and contains signals not present in previously considered (narrative) measures of tax changes. We investigate the effects of tax news and find that, for long anticipation horizons, pre-implementation effects lead initially to contractions in output.</description>

      <title>Identification of Dynamic Panel Logit Models with Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.04590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that identification in a general class of dynamic panel logit models with fixed effects is related to the truncated moment problem from the mathematics literature. We use this connection to show that the identified set for structural parameters and functionals of the distribution of latent individual effects can be characterized by a finite set of conditional moment equalities subject to a certain set of shape constraints on the model parameters. In addition to providing a general approach to identification, the new characterization can deliver informative bounds in cases where competing methods deliver no identifying restrictions, and can deliver point identification in cases where competing methods deliver partial identification. We then present an estimation and inference procedure that uses semidefinite programming methods, is applicable with continuous or discrete covariates, and can be used for models that are either point- or partially-identified. Finally, we illustrate our identification result with a number of examples, and provide an empirical application to employment dynamics using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.</description>

      <title>Kernel methods for long term dose response curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core challenge in causal inference is how to extrapolate long term effects, of possibly continuous actions, from short term experimental data. It arises in artificial intelligence: the long term consequences of continuous actions may be of interest, yet only short term rewards may be collected in exploration. For this estimand, called the long term dose response curve, we propose a simple nonparametric estimator based on kernel ridge regression. By embedding the distribution of the short term experimental data with kernels, we derive interpretable weights for extrapolating long term effects. Our method allows actions, short term rewards, and long term rewards to be continuous in general spaces. It also allows for nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the link between short term effects and long term effects. We prove uniform consistency, with nonasymptotic error bounds reflecting the effective dimension of the data. As an application, we estimate the long term dose response curve of Project STAR, a social program which randomly assigned students to various class sizes. We extend our results to long term counterfactual distributions, proving weak convergence.</description>

      <title>Double Machine Learning for Static Panel Models with Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08174v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in causal inference have seen the development of methods which make use of the predictive power of machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we develop novel double machine learning (DML) procedures for panel data in which these algorithms are used to approximate high-dimensional and nonlinear nuisance functions of the covariates. Our new procedures are extensions of the well-known correlated random effects, within-group and first-difference estimators from linear to nonlinear panel models, specifically, Robinson (1988)'s partially linear regression model with fixed effects and unspecified nonlinear confounding. Our simulation study assesses the performance of these procedures using different machine learning algorithms. We use our procedures to re-estimate the impact of minimum wage on voting behaviour in the UK. From our results, we recommend the use of first-differencing because it imposes the fewest constraints on the distribution of the fixed effects, and an ensemble learning strategy to ensure optimum estimator accuracy.</description>

      <title>Distribution Regression Difference-In-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a simple distribution regression estimator for treatment effects in the difference-in-differences (DiD) design. Our procedure is particularly useful when the treatment effect differs across the distribution of the outcome variable. Our proposed estimator easily incorporates covariates and, importantly, can be extended to settings where the treatment potentially affects the joint distribution of multiple outcomes. Our key identifying restriction is that the counterfactual distribution of the treated in the untreated state has no interaction effect between treatment and time. This assumption results in a parallel trend assumption on a transformation of the distribution. We highlight the relationship between our procedure and assumptions with the changes-in-changes approach of Athey and Imbens (2006). We also reexamine the Card and Krueger (1994) study of the impact of minimum wages on employment to illustrate the utility of our approach.</description>

      <title>An Econometric Analysis of Large Flexible Cryptocurrency-mining Consumers in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, power grids have seen a surge in large cryptocurrency mining firms, with individual consumption levels reaching 700MW. This study examines the behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is influenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local weather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption data of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal autoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that, surprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not directly correlated with cryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary influencers are the temperature and electricity prices. These firms also respond to avoid transmission and distribution network (T&amp;D) charges - commonly referred to as four Coincident peak (4CP) charges - during the summer months. As the scale of these firms is likely to surge in future years, the developed electricity consumption model can be used to generate public, synthetic datasets to understand the overall impact on the power grid. The developed model could also lead to better pricing mechanisms to effectively use the flexibility of these resources towards improving power grid reliability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05798v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive preference learning systems infer human preferences by presenting queries as pairs of options and collecting binary choices. Although binary choices are simple and widely used, they provide limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which are inversely related to preference strength, as an additional signal. We propose a computationally efficient method that combines choices and response times to estimate human utility functions, grounded in the EZ diffusion model from psychology. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that for queries with strong preferences, response times complement choices by providing extra information about preference strength, leading to significantly improved utility estimation. We incorporate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that using response times significantly accelerates preference learning compared to choice-only approaches. Additional materials, such as code, slides, and talk video, are available at https://shenlirobot.github.io/pages/NeurIPS24.html</description>

      <title>Debiased Nonparametric Regression for Statistical Inference and Distributionally Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a debiasing method for smooth nonparametric estimators. While machine learning techniques such as random forests and neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive performance, their theoretical properties remain relatively underexplored. Specifically, many modern algorithms lack assurances of pointwise asymptotic normality and uniform convergence, which are critical for statistical inference and robustness under covariate shift and have been well-established for classical methods like Nadaraya-Watson regression. To address this, we introduce a model-free debiasing method that guarantees these properties for smooth estimators derived from any nonparametric regression approach. By adding a correction term that estimates the conditional expected residual of the original estimator, or equivalently, its estimation error, we obtain a debiased estimator with proven pointwise asymptotic normality, and uniform convergence. These properties enable statistical inference and enhance robustness to covariate shift, making the method broadly applicable to a wide range of nonparametric regression problems.</description>
