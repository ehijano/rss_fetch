      <title>A Global Atlas of Digital Dermatology to Map Innovation and Disparities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of artificial intelligence in dermatology promises democratized access to healthcare, but model reliability depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data fueling these models. Despite rapid growth in publicly available dermatology images, the field lacks quantitative key performance indicators to measure whether new datasets expand clinical coverage or merely replicate what is already known. Here we present SkinMap, a multi-modal framework for the first comprehensive audit of the field's entire data basis. We unify the publicly available dermatology datasets into a single, queryable semantic atlas comprising more than 1.1 million images of skin conditions and quantify (i) informational novelty over time, (ii) dataset redundancy, and (iii) representation gaps across demographics and diagnoses. Despite exponential growth in dataset sizes, informational novelty across time has somewhat plateaued: Some clusters, such as common neoplasms on fair skin, are densely populated, while underrepresented skin types and many rare diseases remain unaddressed. We further identify structural gaps in coverage: Darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick V-VI) constitute only 5.8% of images and pediatric patients only 3.0%, while many rare diseases and phenotype combinations remain sparsely represented. SkinMap provides infrastructure to measure blind spots and steer strategic data acquisition toward undercovered regions of clinical space.</description>

      <title>Scilit with the Integrated Impact Indicator Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically elucidate the background and functionality of the Scilit database and evaluate the feasibility and advantages of the comprehensive impact metrics I3 and I3/N, introduced within the Scilit framework. Using a matched dataset of 17,816 journals, we conduct a comparative analysis of Scilit I3/N, Journal Impact Factor, and CiteScore for 2023 and 2024, covering descriptive statistics and distributional characteristics from both disciplinary and publisher perspectives. The comparison reveals that the Scilit I3 and I3/N framework significantly outperforms traditional mean-based metrics in terms of coverage, methodological robustness, and disciplinary fairness. It provides a more accurate, diagnosable, and responsible solution for interdisciplinary journal impact assessment. Our research serves as a "getting started guide" for Scilit, offering scholars, librarians, and academic publishers in the fields of bibliometrics or scientometrics a valuable perspective for exploring I3 and I3/N within an inclusive database. This enables a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of disciplinary development and scientific progress. We advocate for piloting and validating this method in broader evaluation contexts to foster a more precise and diverse representation of scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Evidence for studying interactions between science and policy: An exploration of scholarly and policy references in Overton-indexed policy documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overton, a global policy index, provides new opportunities to study the interactions between science and policy. This study aims to characterize the presence of scholarly and policy references in Overton-indexed policy documents and examine their distribution across key bibliographic dimensions, thereby assessing Overton's potential as a data source for policy metrics. We analyze a dataset of approximately 17.5 million policy documents from Overton, incorporating metadata such as publication year, policy source, country, language, subject area, and policy topic. Descriptive statistics are employed to assess the presence and distribution of reference data across these dimensions. Overton indexes a substantial volume of policy documents and identifies considerable reference data within them: 7.7% of documents contain scholarly references and 10.6% contain policy references. However, the presence of references varies significantly across publications years, source types, countries, languages, subject areas, and policy topics, indicating coverage biases that may affect interpretations of policy impact. The analysis is based on the Overton database as of June 2025. As Overton is regularly updated, the distribution patterns of indexed documents and references may evolve over time. The findings offer insights into the opportunities and constraints of using Overton for investigating evidence-based policymaking and for assessing the policy uptake of research outputs in the context of research evaluation. This is the first large-scale study to systematically examine the distribution of reference data in Overton. It contributes a foundational understanding of this emerging source for policy metrics, highlighting both its potential applications and limitations, and underlining the importance of addressing current coverage imbalances.</description>

      <title>Deep versus Broad Technology Search and the Timing of Innovation Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study offers a new perspective on the depth-versus-breadth debate in innovation strategy, by modeling inventive search within dynamic collective knowledge systems, and underscoring the importance of timing for technological impact. Using frontier machine learning to project patent citation networks in hyperbolic space, we analyze 4.9 million U.S. patents to examine how search strategies give rise to distinct temporal patterns in impact accumulation. We find that inventions based on deep search, which relies on a specialized understanding of complex recombination structures, drive higher short-term impact through early adoption within specialized communities, but face diminishing returns as innovations become "locked-in" with limited diffusion potential. Conversely, when inventions are grounded in broad search that spans disparate domains, they encounter initial resistance but achieve wider diffusion and greater long-term impact by reaching cognitively diverse audiences. Individual inventions require both depth and breadth for stable impact. Organizations can strategically balance approaches across multiple inventions: using depth to build reliable technological infrastructure while pursuing breadth to expand applications. We advance innovation theory by demonstrating how deep and broad search strategies distinctly shape the timing and trajectory of technological impact, and how individual inventors and organizations can leverage these mechanisms to balance exploitation and exploration.</description>

      <title>ScienceDB AI: An LLM-Driven Agentic Recommender System for Large-Scale Scientific Data Sharing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI for Science (AI4S) has underscored the significance of scientific datasets, leading to the establishment of numerous national scientific data centers and sharing platforms. Despite this progress, efficiently promoting dataset sharing and utilization for scientific research remains challenging. Scientific datasets contain intricate domain-specific knowledge and contexts, rendering traditional collaborative filtering-based recommenders inadequate. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to build conversational agents capable of deep semantic understanding and personalized recommendations. In response, we present ScienceDB AI, a novel LLM-driven agentic recommender system developed on Science Data Bank (ScienceDB), one of the largest global scientific data-sharing platforms. ScienceDB AI leverages natural language conversations and deep reasoning to accurately recommend datasets aligned with researchers' scientific intents and evolving requirements. The system introduces several innovations: a Scientific Intention Perceptor to extract structured experimental elements from complicated queries, a Structured Memory Compressor to manage multi-turn dialogues effectively, and a Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Trustworthy RAG) framework. The Trustworthy RAG employs a two-stage retrieval mechanism and provides citable dataset references via Citable Scientific Task Record (CSTR) identifiers, enhancing recommendation trustworthiness and reproducibility. Through extensive offline and online experiments using over 10 million real-world datasets, ScienceDB AI has demonstrated significant effectiveness. To our knowledge, ScienceDB AI is the first LLM-driven conversational recommender tailored explicitly for large-scale scientific dataset sharing services. The platform is publicly accessible at: https://ai.scidb.cn/en.</description>

      <title>A citation index bridging Hirsch's h and Egghe's g</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a citation index $\nu$ (``nu'') and show that it lies between the classical $h$-index and $g$-index. This idea is then generalized to a monotone parametric family $(\nu_\alpha)$ ($\alpha\ge 0$), whereby $h=\nu_0$ and $\nu=\nu_1$, while the limiting value $\nu_\infty$ is expressed in terms of the maximum citation.</description>

      <title>Polarity Detection of Sustainable Development Goals in News Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally recognised framework for addressing critical societal, environmental, and economic challenges. Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the automatic classification of textual data according to their relevance to specific SDGs. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is equally important to determine the directionality of this relevance; that is, to assess whether the described impact is positive, neutral, or negative. To tackle this challenge, we propose the novel task of SDG polarity detection, which assesses whether a text segment indicates progress toward a specific SDG or conveys an intention to achieve such progress. To support research in this area, we introduce SDG-POD, a benchmark dataset designed specifically for this task, combining original and synthetically generated data. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using six state-of-the-art large LLMs, considering both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. Our results suggest that the task remains challenging for the current generation of LLMs. Nevertheless, some fine-tuned models, particularly QWQ-32B, achieve good performance, especially on specific Sustainable Development Goals such as SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG-15 (Life on Land). Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the fine-tuning dataset with synthetically generated examples yields improved model performance on this task. This result highlights the effectiveness of data enrichment techniques in addressing the challenges of this resource-constrained domain. This work advances the methodological toolkit for sustainability monitoring and provides actionable insights into the development of efficient, high-performing polarity detection systems.</description>
