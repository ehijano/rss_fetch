      <title>Laboratory Investigation of CO2-Driven Enhancement of Radiolytic H2O2 on Europa and Other Icy Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Europa's leading hemisphere reveal elevated H2O2 in the warmer, low latitude chaos terrains compared to the colder, polar regions. This distribution disagrees with prior laboratory radiolysis studies of pure water ice, which show higher H2O2 yields at colder temperatures. The regions with higher peroxide abundance, Tara and Powys Regiones, also present increased amounts of CO2, possibly sourced from Europa's interior. To investigate whether CO2 influences radiolysis of water ice to boost H2O2 production, we irradiated water ice doped with varying amounts of CO2 with 10 keV electrons at 70 and 100 K. Our results indicate that CO2, even in trace amounts (&lt; 3%), significantly enhances H2O2 yields at temperatures relevant to Europa. We discuss the mechanisms by which CO2 boosts peroxide synthesis and quantify H2O2 creation and destruction cross sections and G-values across different CO2 concentrations. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the perplexing H2O2 distribution on Europa and has implications for understanding peroxide on other icy bodies such as Ganymede and Charon, where it has been detected alongside CO2.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy of the Mass-Metallicity Relation of Exoplanetary Atmospheres Demarcated by their Birthplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric observations by JWST raise a growing evidence that atmospheric metallicity exhibits an anti-correlation with masses of giant exoplanets. While such a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it remains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from pebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.</description>

      <title>(Re)-Defining Planets -- the Fundamental Plane of Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6000+ exoplanets are now detected using various techniques, with estimates of billions of planets existing in our Galaxy alone. They are called super-Earths, hot Earths, mini-Neptunes, hot Neptunes, sub-Neptunes, Saturns, Jupiters, hot Jupiters, gas giants, ice giants, rocky, terran, subterran, superterran, and so on. This prompted the emergence of many recent works on taxonomy, or classification, of exoplanets. However, there is still no basic, fundamental definition of 'What is a planet?'. IAU has forwarded a definition in 2006 which, however, raised more questions than it solved. The first ambitious task here is to establish if there are limits on the size/mass of planets. The lower mass limit may be assumed as of Mimas - approximately minimum mass required to attain a nearly spherical hydrostatic equilibrium shape. The upper mass limit may be easier - there is a natural lower limit to what constitutes a star: ~0.08 SU. But then there are brown dwarfs: IAU has defined brown dwarfs as objects that exceed the deuterium burning limit (~13 JU), and giant exoplanets generally have masses of ~0.3 to ~60 JU. The resolution requires assembling the basic physical parameters that define planets quantitatively. Mass and radius are the two fundamental properties, and we propose to use a third correlated parameter: the moment of inertia. Based on this, we create the fundamental planet plane where the two parameters are correlated with the third, similar to a fundamental galactic plane. The fundamental planetary plane with turn-off point diagrams is constructed for the first time in this work. We define a planet as 'A celestial spherical object, bound to a star or unbound, that lies on the fundamental planetary plane, within a mass range between 0.02 EU to 13 JU'.</description>

      <title>BLADE: An Automated Framework for Classifying Light Curves from the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) Fireball Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fireballs (bolides) are high-energy luminous phenomena produced when meteoroids and small asteroids enter Earth's atmosphere at hypersonic speeds, often resulting in fragmentation or complete disintegration accompanied by significant energy release. The resulting bolide light curves capture temporal brightness variations as these objects traverse increasingly dense atmospheric layers, providing essential information on meteoroid entry dynamics, fragmentation behavior, and atmospheric energy deposition processes. The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies' (CNEOS) continuously expanding fireball database offers a globally comprehensive archive of bolide events, including light curves and associated metadata. Events associated with infrasound detections allow direct correlations between acoustic signatures and light-curve features, therefore enabling detailed analyses of fragmentation dynamics and energy deposition. Here, we introduce BLADE (Bolide Light-curve Analysis and Discrimination Explorer), a robust and high-fidelity framework specifically designed to analyze bolide light curves for objects detected from space. BLADE incorporates a processing pipeline integrating Savitzky-Golay filtering, prominence-based peak detection, and gradient analysis, enabling systematic identification and classification of fragmentation events and their associated energy release characteristics. Preliminary results demonstrate that BLADE reliably distinguishes distinct bolide behaviors, providing an objective, scalable methodology for characterization and analysis of large bolide light curve datasets. This foundational work establishes a novel pathway for advanced bolide research, with promising applications in planetary defense and global atmospheric monitoring.</description>

      <title>Osiris revisited: Confirming a solar metallicity and low C/O in HD 209458b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD 209458b is the prototypical hot Jupiter and one of the best targets available for precise atmosphere characterisation. Now that spectra from both Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are available, we can reveal the atmospheric properties in unprecedented detail. In this study, we perform a new data reduction and analysis of the original HST/WFC3 spectrum, accounting for the wavelength dependence of the instrument systematics that was not considered in previous analyses. This allows us to precisely and robustly measure the much-debated H$_2$O abundance in HD 209458b's atmosphere. We combine the newly reduced spectrum with archival JWST/NIRCam data and run free chemistry atmospheric retrievals over the 1.0 - 5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, covering possible features of multiple absorbing species, including CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, HCN, Na, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S. We detect H$_2$O and CO$_2$ robustly at above 7 $\sigma$ significance, and find a 3.6 $\sigma$ preference for cloudy models compared to a clear atmosphere. For all other absorbers we tested, only upper limits of abundance can be measured. We use Bayesian model averaging to account for a range of different assumptions about the cloud properties, resulting in a water volume mixing ratio of $0.95^{+0.35}_{-0.17} \:\times$ solar and a carbon dioxide abundance of $0.94^{+0.16}_{-0.09} \:\times$ solar. Both results are consistent with solar values and comparable to predictions from the VULCAN 1D photochemistry model. Combining these values with a prior on the CO abundance from ground-based measurements, we derive an overall atmospheric composition comparable to solar metallicity of $\mathrm{[M/H]} = 0.10^{+0.41}_{-0.40}$ and very low C/O of $0.054^{+0.080}_{-0.034}$ with a 3 $\sigma$ upper limit of 0.454. This indicates a strong enrichment in oxygen and depletion in carbon during HD 209458b's formation.</description>

      <title>Investigating Transit Timing Variations in the Ultra-short Period Exoplanet WASP-19b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of transit timing variations (TTVs) in the ultra-short-period gas giant WASP-19b, which orbits a G-type main-sequence star. Our analysis is based on a dataset comprising 204 transit light curves obtained from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the Exoplanet Transit Database (ETD), and the ExoClock project, supplemented by 18 publicly available light curves. Mid-transit times were extracted from these data, and an additional 98 mid-transit times compiled from the literature were incorporated, resulting in a combined dataset spanning approximately 14 years. After excluding light curves significantly impacted by stellar activity, such as starspot anomalies, the final dataset consisted of 252 high-quality mid-transit times. Initial inspection of the transit timing residuals using an apsidal precession model suggested the possible presence of an additional planetary companion. However, subsequent frequency analysis and sinusoidal model fitting indicate that the observed TTVs are more consistently explained by apsidal precession of WASP-19b's orbit. We also considered alternative mechanisms, including the Applegate mechanism and the Shklovskii effect. Our findings suggest that stellar magnetic activity, potentially linked to the Applegate mechanism, may also contribute to the observed timing variations. To further constrain the origin of the TTVs and assess the contributions of these mechanisms, continued high-precision photometric monitoring of the WASP-19 system is strongly recommended.</description>

      <title>SO emission in the dynamically perturbed protoplanetary disks around CQ Tau and MWC 758</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous detection of the SO $J_N=6_5-5_4$ (219.949 GHz) rotational transition in archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the spiral hosting protoplanetary disks around CQ Tau (with $\approx4.9\sigma$ significance) and MWC 758 (with $\approx3.4\sigma$ significance). In the former, the SO emission comes in the shape of a ring, arises from the edge of the continuum cavity, and is qualitatively consistent, at the currently available spectral resolution, with being in Keplerian rotation. In the latter, instead, while arising primarily from inside the continuum cavity, the SO emission also extends to the continuum ring(s), and its morphology and kinematics are less clear. We put these sources in the context of the other protoplanetary disks where SO detections have been previously reported in the literature and discuss the possible origins of SO in terms of (thermal) desorption or formation in the gas phase. We argue that these processes might be fostered by dynamical perturbations caused by unseen embedded massive companions, shadows, or late-time infall, thus suggesting a possible link between perturbed dynamics and SO emission in (these) protoplanetary disks. If confirmed, our interpretation would imply that chemical evolution timescales could be significantly shorter in these systems than is commonly assumed, indicating that dynamical perturbations might influence the composition of newborn (proto-)planets by altering the volatile makeup of their formation environment.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Metallicity Effects in Hot Jupiter Occurrence Across Galactic Birth Radius and Phase-Space Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the correlation between host star metallicity and giant planets shapes hot Jupiter occurrence as a function of Galactic birth radius (\rbirth) and phase-space density in the Milky Way disk. Using the GALAH and APOGEE surveys and a galaxy from the NIHAO simulation suite, we inject hot Jupiters around stars based on metallicity power laws, reflecting the trend that giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. For \rbirth\ $\geq 5$ kpc, hot Jupiter occurrence decreases with \rbirth\ by $\sim -0.1%$ per kpc; this is driven by the Galaxy's chemical evolution, where the inner regions of the disk are more metal-rich. Differences in GALAH occurrence rates versus APOGEE's and the simulation's at \rbirth\ $&lt; 5$ kpc arise from survey selection effects. APOGEE and the NIHAO simulation have more high-$\alpha$ sequence stars than GALAH, resulting in average differences in metallicity (0.2--0.4 dex), $\alpha$-process element enrichment (0.2 dex), and vertical velocities (7--14 km/s) at each \rbirth\ bin. Additionally, we replicate the result of \cite{Winter20}, which showed that over 92% of hot Jupiters are associated with stars in phase-space overdensities, or "clustered environments." However, our findings suggest that this clustering effect is primarily driven by chemical and kinematic differences between low and high-$\alpha$ sequence star properties. Our results support stellar characteristics, particularly metallicity, being the primary drivers of hot Jupiter formation, which serves as the "null hypothesis" for interpreting planet demographics. This underscores the need to disentangle planetary and stellar properties from Galactic-scale effects in future planet demographics studies.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XVII: A Compact but Structured Keplerian Disk and Large-scale Streamers Revealed in the Class I Protostellar System IRAS 04169+2702</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution ($\sim$0.05"; 8 au) dust continuum and molecular line observations toward the Class I protostellar system IRAS 04169+2702 in the Taurus B213 region, as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). The 1.3-mm dust continuum emission traces a circumstellar disk with a central depression toward the protostar. Our VLA observations of the same target reveal a single central peak dominated by the free-free emission, which coincides with the depression of the thermal dust emission. The mean spectral index of the thermal dust emission from 1.3 mm to 1.4 cm is approximately 2.8, suggestive of the presence of grains grown to millimeter or centimeter sizes in the disk. Velocity gradients along the disk major axis are seen in emission from $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), and C$^{18}$O (2-1) molecular lines. The position-velocity diagrams of these lines unveil a Keplerian-rotating disk with a radius of $\sim$21 au around a 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ protostar, as well as an infalling and rotating envelope with the angular momentum conserved. In addition to the compact disk, large-scale infalling spiral structures extending up to approximately 1400 au, streamers, are discovered in C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0, 3}$-2$_{0, 2}$) as well as in the 1.3-mm continuum emission. Notably, in the region closer to the protostar, the spatial coincidence of C$^{18}$O and SO may indicate the presence of a shock related to accretion through the spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Classification through Vision Transformers with Temporal Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources. Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias. Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits. Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation, performance, and generalization of the model.</description>

      <title>Modeling the position and velocity distribution of space objects by maximizing entropy with energy constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed a 6-dimensional joint probability density function for the 3-dimensional position and 3-dimensional velocity vectors of space objects in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) based on the Principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), adhering to the principle of energy conservation. For the problem under consideration, maximizing entropy subject to energy conservation ensures that the derived probability density function (PDF) is the best representation of the uncertainty of a space object while the sampled position and velocity vectors from the PDF adhere to the orbital dynamics. We approach the entropy maximization by constructing a Lagrangian functional incorporating the energy conservation constraint and the normalization constraint of the PDF using Lagrange multipliers, setting the functional derivative of the Lagrangian to zero. This PDF can be used to generate position and velocity samples for space objects without any prior assumption and can further be utilized for orbital uncertainty propagation either using the Monte-Carlo method or by direct propagation of the PDF through the Fokker-Planck Equation.</description>

Abstract: On 26 September 2022 the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft collided with Dimorphos, the moon of the near-Earth asteroid 65803 Didymos, in a full-scale demonstration of a kinetic impactor concept. The companion LICIACube spacecraft documented the aftermath, capturing images of the expansion and evolution of the ejecta from 29 to 243 s after the impact. We present results from our analyses of these observations, including an improved reduction of the data and new absolute calibration, an updated LICIACube trajectory, and a detailed description of the events and phenomena that were recorded throughout the flyby. One notable aspect of the ejecta was the existence of clusters of boulders, up to 3.6 m in radius, that were ejected at speeds up to 52 m/s. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of 104 of these boulders suggests that they are likely the remnants of larger boulders shattered by the DART spacecraft in the first stages of the impact. The amount of momentum contained in these boulders is more than 3 times that of the DART spacecraft, and it is directed primarily to the south, almost perpendicular to the DART trajectory. Recoil of Dimorphos from the ejection of these boulders has the potential to change its orbital plane by up to a degree and to impart a non-principal axis component to its rotation state. Damping timescales for these phenomena are such that the Hera spacecraft, arriving at the system in 2026, should be able to measure these effects.</description>

      <title>The nanoscale molecular chemistry of outer solar system organic matter in asteroid Ryugu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of biorelevant molecules in returned mission samples such as from the carbonaceous asteroid (162173) Ryugu is key to unravelling the role of extraterrestrial organics in the evolution of life. Coordinated analyses using minimally destructive techniques at the finest length-scales on pristine samples are particularly important. Here, we identify the chemical signature of unique globular and nitrogen-containing diffuse organic matter in asteroid Ryugu and map the distribution of these biorelevant molecules with unprecedented detail. Using a novel electron-microscopy-based combination of vibrational and core-level spectroscopy, we disentangle the chemistry and nanoscale petrography of these organics. We show that some of these organics contain soluble and highly aliphatic components as well as NHx functional groups, that must have formed in outer solar nebula environments before parent body incorporation. These novel coordinated analyses will open up new avenues of research on these types of precious and rare asteroidal dust samples.</description>

      <title>Global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. I. Zero-net flux regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary discs, which encompass the putative habitable zone, are dynamically complex, featuring a well ionised, turbulent active inner region and a poorly ionised dead outer region. In this first paper, we investigate a base level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around this dead-active zone interface, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a hot disc and cool corona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic field loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These loops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the disc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows in the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure maximum, that extends across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result of outward mass transport from the active region. This triggers the Rossby wave instability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices, though their coherence is weakened due to the turbulent dynamics at the interface. Third, the dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely resulting from the outward diffusion of large-scale poloidal loops in the active zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical structure consistent with that required to drive accretion in the inner dead zone under the weak magnetic wind paradigm. In the second paper in the series, we extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux transport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.</description>

      <title>Super-Earth formation in systems with cold giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around our Sun, terrestrial planets did not grow beyond Earth in mass, while super-Earths are found to orbit approximately every other solar-like star. It remains unclear what divides these super-Earth systems from those that form terrestrial planets, and what role wide-orbit gas giants play in this process. Here, we show that the key uncertainty is the degree of viscous heating in the inner disc, which regulates the pebble accretion efficiency. In this parameter study, we assume pebble sizes limited by fragmentation and radial drift. The initial seed planetesimals for embryo growth are taken from the top of the streaming instability mass distribution. We then evaluate the important role of the pebble scale height and the assumed pebble fragmentation velocity. In systems with maximally efficient viscous heating, where all the accretion heating is deposited in the disc midplane, pebble accretion in the terrestrial region is suppressed. More realistic levels of viscous heating, at higher elevations, allow terrestrial embryo formation at Earth-like orbits. We also find that the role of the water iceline is minor, unless it is paired with extreme volatile loss and a change in the pebble fragmentation velocity. Furthermore, we show that in systems with gas-giant formation, the role of mutual pebble filtering by outer pebble-accreting embryos is limited, unless some mechanism of delaying inner disc growth, such as viscous heating or the presence of an iceline, is simultaneously employed. This latter point appears to be consistent with the fact that no strong suppression is seen in the occurrence rate of super-Earths in systems with known gas giants in wider orbits. We conclude that the diversity in inner-disc systems may largely be driven by complex, and as of yet poorly understood, disc accretion physics inside the water iceline.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of interferometric observations and characterization of planet-induced structures at sub au to au scales in protoplanetary disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks by VLTI and ALMA have greatly improved our understanding of the detailed structure of these planetary birthplaces. These observations have revealed a variety of large-scale disk substructures, including rings, gaps, and spirals, spanning tens to hundreds of au, supporting the predictions of planet formation models. Recent instruments, such as MATISSE at the VLTI, allow one to resolve and investigate the inner few au of protoplanetary disks in nearby star formation regions, shedding light on the traces of planet formation and evolution at these small scales. The aim of this work is to assess the feasibility of interferometric observations of small-scale planet-induced substructures in protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions. We aim to characterize these substructures in multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations and subsequently differentiate between simulation parameters. On the basis of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of embedded planetary companions and subsequent 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we calculated and analyzed interferometric observables, assuming observations with the VLTI in the K, L, M, and N bands. The hydrodynamic simulations exhibit mass-dependent planet-induced density waves that create observable substructures, most notably for the considered case of a 300 $M_{\oplus}$ planet. These substructures share similarities with observed large-scale structures and feature a prominent accretion region around the embedded planet. The visibilities show a detectable variability for multi-epoch VLTI/GRAVITY and VLTI/MATISSE observations, caused by the orbital motion of the planet, that are distinguishable from other sources of variability due to their unique combination of timescale and amplitude.</description>

Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass make up the entire dark matter, they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work, we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of PBHs, are performed. We find that the gravitational effect of the PBHs is dominated by the closest encounter. Using the Earth-Mars distance as an observational probe, we show that the perturbations are smaller than the current measurement uncertainties and thus PBHs are not directly constrained by solar system ephemerides. We estimate that an improvement in the ranging accuracy by an order of magnitude or the extraction of signals well below the noise level is required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Microwave scattering by rough polyhedral particles on a surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) scattering by non-symmetric wavelength-scale particles on a planar surface has numerous applications in the remote sensing of planetary bodies, both in planetary and geo-sciences. We conduct numerical simulations of EM scattering by rough polyhedral particles (with 12 or 20 faces) using the discrete-dipole approximation and contrast the results to that of spheres. The particles have permittivities corresponding to common minerals in the microwave regime ($\epsilon_r=4.7 + 0.016$i and $7.8 + 0.09$i), and a size-frequency distribution (SFD) consistent with the observed scattering properties (power-law distribution of size parameters between 0.5 and 8 with an index from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$). The assumed substrate permittivity $2.4 + 0.012$i corresponds to a powdered regolith. We present what roles the particle roundness, permittivity, and SFD for a realistic range of parameters play in the EM scattering properties as a function of incidence angle with a focus on backscattering in microwave-remote-sensing applications. The particle roundness and SFD have a clearly observable effect on the polarimetric properties, while the role of permittivity is relatively minor (in the studied range). Among various backscattering observables, the circular polarization ratio is the least sensitive to the decrease of the upper boundary (down to a size parameter of 3) and the index of the SFD.</description>

      <title>An Early Look at the Performance of IGRINS-2 at Gemini-North with Application to the ultrahot Jupiter, WASP-33 b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy enables precise molecular detections and velocity-resolved atmospheric dynamics, offering a distinct advantage over low-resolution methods for exoplanetary atmospheric studies. IGRINS-2, the successor to IGRINS, features improved throughput and enhanced sensitivity to carbon monoxide by shifting its $\textit{K}$-band coverage by 36 nm to longer wavelengths. IGRINS is a near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph mounted at McDonald, Lowell, and Gemini-South observatories. Our order-drop test shows this added range improves the CO cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 2$-$3%, confirming a measurable but modest sensitivity gain. To evaluate its performance, we attempt to investigate the atmospheric characteristics of WASP-33 b. Observations were conducted on 2024 January 7 for a total of 2.43 hours; This includes 1.46 hours in the pre-eclipse phase to capture the planet's thermal emission spectrum. We successfully detect clear cross-correlation signals from molecular species in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b with a combined SNR of 7.4. More specifically, we capture CO, H$_{2}$O, and OH with SNRs of 6.3, 4.7, and 4.2, respectively. These results are consistent with previous studies and demonstrate that IGRINS-2 is well-suited for detailed investigation of exoplanetary atmospheres. We anticipate that future observations with IGRINS-2 will further advance our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Effects of transient stellar emissions on planetary climates of tidally-locked exo-earths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space weather in exoplanetary systems, driven by transient stellar emissions such as flares, coronal mass ejections, and stellar proton events, can significantly influence planetary habitability and the long-term evolution of atmospheres. These time-dependent phenomena also complicate the remote characterization of exoplanets by altering the abundance of key chemical species and modulating atmospheric brightness temperatures. While prior studies have largely focused on photochemical effects, surface UV dosages, and spectral consequences, here we extend the analysis using three-dimensional general circulation models coupled with interactive photochemistry. We simulate the climate and chemical responses of TRAPPIST-1e-like, synchronously rotating planets subjected to stellar energetic particle events and periodic UV flux enhancements. Using statistical methods, we evaluate impacts across spatial and temporal scales. Our results show that abrupt thermospheric cooling occurs via radiative emissions from NO and CO2, while warming in the middle and lower atmosphere arises from increased infrared absorbers, including N2O and H2O. In moderately active stellar regimes, atmospheric temperature changes are strongly modulated by O3 variability. Cumulative effects depend on flare frequency, while instantaneous responses are sensitive to the spectral energy distribution of the flare. Notably, intense flares can dynamically energize the middle atmosphere, enhancing wind speeds by up to 40 m/s on the substellar nightside at altitudes of 30 to 50 km. These findings suggest that repeated, high-energy eruptive events from young stars may play a critical role in shaping atmospheric dynamics on temperate terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Double Hot Jupiter Systems through von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism with tidal friction has been demonstrated as a promising avenue to generate hot Jupiters in stellar binary systems. Previous population studies of hot Jupiter formation have largely examined this mechanism in systems comprised of three bodies: two stars and one planet. However, because stars in a binary system form in similar environments with comparable metallicities, the formation of a single hot Jupiter in such a system may imply that the conditions are more likely met for the companion star, as well. We investigate the ZLK mechanism with tidal friction as a potential mechanism to produce double hot Jupiter systems in stellar binaries. Using N-body simulations, we characterize the evolution of two cold Jupiters, each orbiting one star in a binary system, undergoing mirrored ZLK migration. We then examine the robustness of this mechanism to asymmetries in stellar masses, planet masses, and planet orbital inclinations relative to the binary plane. We predict that, under the assumptions that (1) most hot Jupiters in binary star systems form through ZLK migration of primordially formed cold Jupiters and (2) if one star in a binary system forms a cold Jupiter, the second does as well, a comprehensive search could identify double hot Jupiters in up to ~9% of the close- to moderate- separation $a&lt;2000$ AU) binary systems that already host a known hot Jupiter. We also argue that a blind search for ZLK-migrated double hot Jupiters should prioritize twin stellar binaries with pericenter approaches of a few hundred AU.</description>

      <title>Study of Venera Spacecraft Trajectories and Wider Implications</title>

Abstract: Historically, there is no doubt that the early years of the USSR space program put them way ahead of the competition (the USA). Nonetheless, although this was not what the Russians wished to present to the world, the interplanetary campaign, centred around missions to the planet Venus (the Venera program) was also beset with difficulties. Many of the early Venera probes failed, despite making it to a heliocentric orbit, but naturally the success rate improved with time. The result is that there are now many Venera probes in heliocentric orbits, either completely intact, or the main bus after a successful deployment of the lander; together with the associated Blok-L upper stages. This paper is a response to some previous quite contentious research proposing that a certain member of a new class of objects, designated $2005\ VL_1$ may in fact be the Venera-2 probe. In this paper we look into the invariance of the Earth Tisserand parameter in an attempt to establish if there are indeed any members of this class which could be Venera probes. It is found, with extremely small probability, that compared to a sample of randomly chosen NEOs, members of the class of Dark Comet have an Earth Tisserand unusually close to 3, a property shared by the Venera missions. Furthermore there are particular associations of 3 Dark Comets with 3 of these probes, the most significant being $2010\ VL_{65}$ with the Venera-12 mission</description>

Abstract: It has been recently argued in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} that numerous enigmatic observations remain challenging to explain within the framework of conventional physics. These anomalies include unexpected correlations between temperature variations in the stratosphere, the total electron content of the Earth's atmosphere, and earthquake activity on one hand, and the positions of planets on the other. Decades of collected data provide statistically significant evidence for these observed correlations. The work in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} suggests that these correlations arise from strongly interacting ``streaming invisible matter'' which gets gravitationally focused by the solar system bodies including the Earth's inner mass distribution. Here, we propose that some of these, as well as other anomalies, may be explained by rare yet energetic events involving the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQNs) impacting the Earth. In other words, we identify the ``streaming invisible matter'' conjectured in \cite{Bertolucci:2016xjm, Zioutas:2020ndf, Zioutas:2023ybw} with AQNs, offering a concrete microscopic mechanism to elucidate the observed correlations. It is important to note that the AQN model was originally developed to address the observed similarity between the dark matter and visible matter densities in the Universe \cite{Zhitnitsky:2002qa, Zhitnitsky:2021iwg}, i.e., $\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ and not explain the anomalies discussed here. Nonetheless, we support our proposal by demonstrating that the intensity and spectral characteristics of AQN-induced events are consistent with the aforementioned puzzling observations.</description>

      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Calling Plots "Allan Variance" Plots When They Aren't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13238</link>

Abstract: I highlight that there is a substantial number of papers (at least 11 published since 2024) which all refer to a specific type of plot as an "Allan variance" plot, when in fact they seem to be plotting the standard deviation of the residuals versus bin size. The Allan variance quantifies the stability of a time series by calculating the average squared difference between successive time-averaged segments over a specified interval; it is not equivalent to the standard deviation. This misattribution seems particularly prolific in the exoplanet transit spectroscopy community. However, I emphasize that it does not impact the scientific analyses presented in those works. I discuss where this confusion seems to stem from and encourage the community to ensure statistical measures are named correctly to avoid confusion.</description>

      <title>Exoplaneteers Keep Overestimating Sigma Significances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomers, and in particular exoplaneteers, have a curious habit of expressing Bayes factors as frequentist sigma values. This is of course completely unnecessary and arguably rather ill-advised. Regardless, the practice is common - especially in the detection claims of chemical species within exoplanet atmospheres. The current canonical conversion strategy stems from a statistics paper from Sellke et al. (2001), who derived an upper bound on the Bayes factor between the test and null hypotheses, as a function of the $p$-value (or number of sigmas, $n_{\sigma}$). A common practice within the exoplanet atmosphere community is to numerically invert this formula, going from a Bayes factor to $n_\sigma$. This goes back to Benneke &amp; Seager (2013) -- a highly cited paper that introduced Bayesian model comparison as a means of inferring the presence of specific chemical species -- in an attempt to calibrate the Bayes factors from their technique for a community that in 2013 was more familiar with frequentist sigma significances. However, as originally noted by Sellke et al. (2001), the conversion only provides an upper limit on $n_\sigma$, with the true value generally being lower. This can result in inflations of claimed detection significances, and this note strongly urges the community to stop converting to $n_\sigma$ at all and simply stick with Bayes factors.</description>
