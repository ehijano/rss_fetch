      <title>Variants of Wythoff game with terminal positions or blocking maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the software Walnut can be used to obtain concise proofs of results concerning variants of the famous Wythoff game, in which blocking maneuvers or terminal positions are added, as discussed respectively by Larsson (2011) and Komak et al. (2025). Our approach provides automatic proofs that both confirm and extend their results, and the same techniques apply to newly introduced variants as well.
  Then, using classic techniques, we obtain new recursive and morphic characterizations of Wythoff-type games where the set of terminal positions $(x,y)$ satisfy $x+y\le\ell$.
  The use of Walnut in combinatorial game theory is relatively recent, and only a few examples have been explored so far. The Wythoff game, being directly connected to the Fibonacci numeration system, proves especially well-suited to this kind of approach. It permits us to solve instances for a fixed value of a parameter.</description>

      <title>The Linear Arboricity Conjecture for Graphs with Large Girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Linear Arboricity Conjecture asserts that the linear arboricity of a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is $\lceil (\Delta+1)/2 \rceil$. For a $2k$-regular graph $G$, this implies $la(G) = k+1$. In this note, we utilize a network flow construction to establish upper bounds on $la(G)$ conditioned on the girth $g(G)$. We prove that if $g(G) \ge 2k$, the conjecture holds true, i.e., $la(G) \le k+1$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for graphs with girth $g(G)$ at least $k$, $k/2$, $k/4$ and $2k/c$ for any integer constant $c$, the linear arboricity $la(G)$ satisfies the upper bounds $k+2$, $k+3$, $k+5$ and $k+\left\lceil \frac{3c+2}{2}\right\rceil$, respectively. Our approach relies on decomposing the graph into $k$ edge-disjoint 2-factors and constructing an auxiliary flow network with lower bound constraints to identify a sparse transversal subgraph that intersects every cycle in the decomposition.</description>

      <title>On the complex zeros and the computational complexity of approximating the reliability polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we relate the location of the complex zeros of the reliability polynomial to parameters at which a certain family of rational functions derived from the reliability polynomial exhibits chaotic behaviour. We use this connection to prove new results about the location of reliability zeros. In particular we show that there are zeros with modulus larger than $1$ with essentially any possible argument. We moreover use this connection to show that approximately evaluating the reliability polynomial for planar graphs at a non-positive algebraic number in the unit disk is #P-hard.</description>

      <title>The parameterized complexity of Strong Conflict-Free Vertex-Connection Colorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues the study of a new variant of graph coloring with a connectivity constraint recently introduced by Hsieh et al. [COCOON 2024]. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if it admits a (proper) vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices are connected by a conflict-free shortest path. Among others, we show that deciding, for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $k$-colorable is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the vertex cover number. But under the standard complexity-theoretic assumption NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly, deciding, for a given graph $G$, whether $G$ is strongly conflict-free $3$-colorable does not admit a polynomial kernel, even for bipartite graphs. This kernel lower bound is in stark contrast to the ordinal $k$-Coloring problem which is known to admit a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex cover number.</description>
