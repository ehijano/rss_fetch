      <title>General Decidability Results for Systems with Continuous Counters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counters that hold natural numbers are ubiquitous in modeling and verifying software systems; for example, they model dynamic creation and use of resources in concurrent programs. Unfortunately, such discrete counters often lead to extremely high complexity. Continuous counters are an efficient over-approximation of discrete counters. They are obtained by relaxing the original counters to hold values over the non-negative rational numbers.
  This work shows that continuous counters are extraordinarily well-behaved in terms of decidability. Our main result is that, despite continuous counters being infinite-state, the language of sequences of counter instructions that can arrive in a given target configuration, is regular. Moreover, a finite automaton for this language can be computed effectively. This implies that a wide variety of transition systems can be equipped with continuous counters, while maintaining decidability of reachability properties. Examples include higher-order recursion schemes, well-structured transition systems, and decidable extensions of discrete counter systems.
  We also prove a non-elementary lower bound for the size of the resulting finite automaton.</description>

      <title>State Complexity of Multiple Concatenation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe witness languages meeting the upper bound on the state complexity of the multiple concatenation of $k$ regular languages over an alphabet of size $k+1$ with a significantly simpler proof than that in the literature. We also consider the case where some languages may be recognized by two-state automata. Then we show that one symbol can be saved, and we define witnesses for the multiple concatenation of $k$ languages over a $k$-letter alphabet. This solves an open problem stated by Caron et al. [2018, Fundam. Inform. 160, 255--279]. We prove that for the concatenation of three languages, the ternary alphabet is optimal. We also show that a trivial upper bound on the state complexity of multiple concatenation is asymptotically tight for ternary languages, and that a lower bound remains exponential in the binary case. Finally, we obtain a tight upper bound for unary cyclic languages and languages recognized by unary automata that do not have final states in their tails.</description>

      <title>On the ET0L subgroup membership problem in bounded automata groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the subgroup membership problem in groups acting on rooted $d$-regular trees and a natural class of subgroups, the stabilisers of infinite rays emanating from the root. These rays, which can also be viewed as infinite words in the alphabet with d letters, form the boundary of the tree. Stabilisers of infinite rays are not finitely generated in general, but if the ray is computable, the membership problem is well posed and solvable. The main result of the paper is that, for bounded automata groups, the membership problem in the stabiliser of any ray that is eventually periodic as an infinite word, forms an ET0L language that is constructable. The result is optimal in the sense that, in general, the membership problem for the stabiliser of an infinite ray in a bounded automata group cannot be context-free. As an application, we give a recursive formula for the associated generating function, aka the Green function, on the corresponding infinite Schreier graph.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Computational Paths and Fundamental Groups in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational paths treat propositional equality as explicit paths built from labelled deduction steps and rewrite rules. This view originates in work by de Queiroz and collaborators [1] and yields a weak groupoid structure for equality, together with a computational account of homotopy inspired by homotopy type theory. In this paper we present a complete mechanization of this framework in Lean 4 and show how it supports concrete homotopy theoretic computations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we formalize the theory of computational paths in Lean, including path formation, composition, inverses, and a rewrite system that identifies redundant or trivial paths. We prove that equality types with computational paths carry a weak groupoid structure in the sense of the original theory. Second, we organize this material into a reusable Lean library, ComputationalPathsLean, which exposes an interface for paths, rewrites, and loop spaces. This library allows later developments to treat computational paths as a drop-in replacement for propositional equality when reasoning about homotopical structure. Third, we apply the library to six canonical examples in algebraic topology. We give Lean proofs that the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers, the cylinder and Mobius band also have fundamental group isomorphic to the integers (via retraction to the circle), the fundamental group of the torus is isomorphic to the product of two copies of the integers, the fundamental group of the Klein bottle is isomorphic to the semidirect product Z cross Z, and the fundamental group of the real projective plane is isomorphic to Z_2. These case studies demonstrate that the computational paths approach scales to nontrivial homotopical computations in a modern proof assistant. All the definitions and proofs described here are available in an open-source Lean 4 repository.</description>
