      <title>Shorter Is Different: Characterizing the Dynamics of Short-Form Video Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging short-form video platforms have been growing tremendously and become one of the leading social media recently. Although the expanded popularity of these platforms has attracted increasing research attention, there has been a lack of understanding of whether and how they deviate from traditional long-form video-sharing platforms such as YouTube and Bilibili. To address this, we conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis of Kuaishou, one of the largest short-form video platforms in China. Based on 248 million videos uploaded to the platform across all categories, we identify their notable differences from long-form video platforms through a comparison study with Bilibili, a leading long-form video platform in China. We find that videos are shortened by multiples on Kuaishou, with distinctive categorical distributions over-represented by life-related rather than interest-based videos. Users interact with videos less per view, but top videos can even more effectively acquire users' collective attention. More importantly, ordinary content creators have higher probabilities of producing hit videos. Our results shed light on the uniqueness of short-form video platforms and pave the way for future research and design for better short-form video ecology.</description>

      <title>Testing and validation of innovative eXtended Reality technologies for astronaut training in a partial-gravity parabolic flight campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of eXtended Reality (XR) technologies in the space domain has increased significantly over the past few years as it can offer many advantages when simulating complex and challenging environments. Space agencies are currently using these disruptive tools to train astronauts for Extravehicular Activities (EVAs), to test equipment and procedures, and to assess spacecraft and hardware designs. With the Moon being the current focus of the next generation of space exploration missions, simulating its harsh environment is one of the key areas where XR can be applied, particularly for astronaut training. Peculiar lunar lighting conditions in combination with reduced gravity levels will highly impact human locomotion especially for movements such as walking, jumping, and running. In order to execute operations on the lunar surface and to safely live on the Moon for an extended period of time, innovative training methodologies and tools such as XR are becoming paramount to perform pre-mission validation and certification. This research work presents the findings of the experiments aimed at exploring the integration of XR technology and parabolic flight activities for astronaut training. In addition, the study aims to consolidate these findings into a set of guidelines that can assist future researchers who wish to incorporate XR technology into lunar training and preparation activities, including the use of such XR tools during long duration missions.</description>

      <title>DiffuseST: Unleashing the Capability of the Diffusion Model for Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Style transfer aims to fuse the artistic representation of a style image with the structural information of a content image. Existing methods train specific networks or utilize pre-trained models to learn content and style features. However, they rely solely on textual or spatial representations that are inadequate to achieve the balance between content and style. In this work, we propose a novel and training-free approach for style transfer, combining textual embedding with spatial features and separating the injection of content or style. Specifically, we adopt the BLIP-2 encoder to extract the textual representation of the style image. We utilize the DDIM inversion technique to extract intermediate embeddings in content and style branches as spatial features. Finally, we harness the step-by-step property of diffusion models by separating the injection of content and style in the target branch, which improves the balance between content preservation and style fusion. Various experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed DiffeseST for achieving balanced and controllable style transfer results, as well as the potential to extend to other tasks.</description>

      <title>GSSF: Generalized Structural Sparse Function for Deep Cross-modal Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal metric learning is a prominent research topic that bridges the semantic heterogeneity between vision and language. Existing methods frequently utilize simple cosine or complex distance metrics to transform the pairwise features into a similarity score, which suffers from an inadequate or inefficient capability for distance measurements. Consequently, we propose a Generalized Structural Sparse Function to dynamically capture thorough and powerful relationships across modalities for pair-wise similarity learning while remaining concise but efficient. Specifically, the distance metric delicately encapsulates two formats of diagonal and block-diagonal terms, automatically distinguishing and highlighting the cross-channel relevancy and dependency inside a structured and organized topology. Hence, it thereby empowers itself to adapt to the optimal matching patterns between the paired features and reaches a sweet spot between model complexity and capability. Extensive experiments on cross-modal and two extra uni-modal retrieval tasks (image-text retrieval, person re-identification, fine-grained image retrieval) have validated its superiority and flexibility over various popular retrieval frameworks. More importantly, we further discover that it can be seamlessly incorporated into multiple application scenarios, and demonstrates promising prospects from Attention Mechanism to Knowledge Distillation in a plug-and-play manner. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Paranioar/GSSF.</description>

      <title>ContextDet: Temporal Action Detection with Adaptive Context Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal action detection (TAD), which locates and recognizes action segments, remains a challenging task in video understanding due to variable segment lengths and ambiguous boundaries. Existing methods treat neighboring contexts of an action segment indiscriminately, leading to imprecise boundary predictions. We introduce a single-stage ContextDet framework, which makes use of large-kernel convolutions in TAD for the first time. Our model features a pyramid adaptive context aggragation (ACA) architecture, capturing long context and improving action discriminability. Each ACA level consists of two novel modules. The context attention module (CAM) identifies salient contextual information, encourages context diversity, and preserves context integrity through a context gating block (CGB). The long context module (LCM) makes use of a mixture of large- and small-kernel convolutions to adaptively gather long-range context and fine-grained local features. Additionally, by varying the length of these large kernels across the ACA pyramid, our model provides lightweight yet effective context aggregation and action discrimination. We conducted extensive experiments and compared our model with a number of advanced TAD methods on six challenging TAD benchmarks: MultiThumos, Charades, FineAction, EPIC-Kitchens 100, Thumos14, and HACS, demonstrating superior accuracy at reduced inference speed.</description>

      <title>Scene Graph Generation with Role-Playing Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approaches for open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) use vision-language models such as CLIP and follow a standard zero-shot pipeline -- computing similarity between the query image and the text embeddings for each category (i.e., text classifiers). In this work, we argue that the text classifiers adopted by existing OVSGG methods, i.e., category-/part-level prompts, are scene-agnostic as they remain unchanged across contexts. Using such fixed text classifiers not only struggles to model visual relations with high variance, but also falls short in adapting to distinct contexts. To plug these intrinsic shortcomings, we devise SDSGG, a scene-specific description based OVSGG framework where the weights of text classifiers are adaptively adjusted according to the visual content. In particular, to generate comprehensive and diverse descriptions oriented to the scene, an LLM is asked to play different roles (e.g., biologist and engineer) to analyze and discuss the descriptive features of a given scene from different views. Unlike previous efforts simply treating the generated descriptions as mutually equivalent text classifiers, SDSGG is equipped with an advanced renormalization mechanism to adjust the influence of each text classifier based on its relevance to the presented scene (this is what the term "specific" means). Furthermore, to capture the complicated interplay between subjects and objects, we propose a new lightweight module called mutual visual adapter. It refines CLIP's ability to recognize relations by learning an interaction-aware semantic space. Extensive experiments on prevalent benchmarks show that SDSGG outperforms top-leading methods by a clear margin.</description>

      <title>EVA: An Embodied World Model for Future Video Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World models integrate raw data from various modalities, such as images and language to simulate comprehensive interactions in the world, thereby displaying crucial roles in fields like mixed reality and robotics. Yet, applying the world model for accurate video prediction is quite challenging due to the complex and dynamic intentions of the various scenes in practice. In this paper, inspired by the human rethinking process, we decompose the complex video prediction into four meta-tasks that enable the world model to handle this issue in a more fine-grained manner. Alongside these tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named Embodied Video Anticipation Benchmark (EVA-Bench) to provide a well-rounded evaluation. EVA-Bench focused on evaluating the video prediction ability of human and robot actions, presenting significant challenges for both the language model and the generation model. Targeting embodied video prediction, we propose the Embodied Video Anticipator (EVA), a unified framework aiming at video understanding and generation. EVA integrates a video generation model with a visual language model, effectively combining reasoning capabilities with high-quality generation. Moreover, to enhance the generalization of our framework, we tailor-designed a multi-stage pretraining paradigm that adaptatively ensembles LoRA to produce high-fidelity results. Extensive experiments on EVA-Bench highlight the potential of EVA to significantly improve performance in embodied scenes, paving the way for large-scale pre-trained models in real-world prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>OpenMU: Your Swiss Army Knife for Music Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OpenMU-Bench, a large-scale benchmark suite for addressing the data scarcity issue in training multimodal language models to understand music. To construct OpenMU-Bench, we leveraged existing datasets and bootstrapped new annotations. OpenMU-Bench also broadens the scope of music understanding by including lyrics understanding and music tool usage. Using OpenMU-Bench, we trained our music understanding model, OpenMU, with extensive ablations, demonstrating that OpenMU outperforms baseline models such as MU-Llama. Both OpenMU and OpenMU-Bench are open-sourced to facilitate future research in music understanding and to enhance creative music production efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Latent Space Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucination poses a challenge to the deployment of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in applications. Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Modelling Concurrent RTP Flows for End-to-end Predictions of QoS in Real Time Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)-based real-time communications (RTC) applications, exemplified by video conferencing, have experienced an unparalleled surge in popularity and development in recent years. In pursuit of optimizing their performance, the prediction of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics emerges as a pivotal endeavor, bolstering network monitoring and proactive solutions. However, contemporary approaches are confined to individual RTP flows and metrics, falling short in relationship capture and computational efficiency. To this end, we propose Packet-to-Prediction (P2P), a novel deep learning (DL) framework that hinges on raw packets to simultaneously process concurrent RTP flows and perform end-to-end prediction of multiple QoS metrics. Specifically, we implement a streamlined architecture, namely length-free Transformer with cross and neighbourhood attention, capable of handling an unlimited number of RTP flows, and employ a multi-task learning paradigm to forecast four key metrics in a single shot. Our work is based on extensive traffic collected during real video calls, and conclusively, P2P excels comparative models in both prediction performance and temporal efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Multimodal Emotional Support Conversation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health care promises a new horizon for therapist-client interactions, aiming to closely emulate the depth and nuance of human conversations. Despite the potential, the current landscape of conversational AI is markedly limited by its reliance on single-modal data, constraining the systems' ability to empathize and provide effective emotional support. This limitation stems from a paucity of resources that encapsulate the multimodal nature of human communication essential for therapeutic counseling. To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Emotional Support Conversation (MESC) dataset, a first-of-its-kind resource enriched with comprehensive annotations across text, audio, and video modalities. This dataset captures the intricate interplay of user emotions, system strategies, system emotion, and system responses, setting a new precedent in the field. Leveraging the MESC dataset, we propose a general Sequential Multimodal Emotional Support framework (SMES) grounded in Therapeutic Skills Theory. Tailored for multimodal dialogue systems, the SMES framework incorporates an LLM-based reasoning model that sequentially generates user emotion recognition, system strategy prediction, system emotion prediction, and response generation. Our rigorous evaluations demonstrate that this framework significantly enhances the capability of AI systems to mimic therapist behaviors with heightened empathy and strategic responsiveness. By integrating multimodal data in this innovative manner, we bridge the critical gap between emotion recognition and emotional support, marking a significant advancement in conversational AI for mental health support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a speech enhancement system for multitrack audio. The system will minimize auditory masking while allowing one to hear multiple simultaneous speakers. The system can be used in multiple communication scenarios e.g., teleconferencing, invoice gaming, and live streaming. The ITU-R BS.1387 Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) model is used to evaluate the amount of masking in the audio signals. Different audio effects e.g., level balance, equalization, dynamic range compression, and spatialization are applied via an iterative Harmony searching algorithm that aims to minimize the masking. In the subjective listening test, the designed system can compete with mixes by professional sound engineers and outperforms mixes by existing auto-mixing systems.</description>

      <title>CinePile: A Long Video Question Answering Dataset and Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current datasets for long-form video understanding often fall short of providing genuine long-form comprehension challenges, as many tasks derived from these datasets can be successfully tackled by analyzing just one or a few random frames from a video. To address this issue, we present a novel dataset and benchmark, CinePile, specifically designed for authentic long-form video understanding. This paper details our innovative approach for creating a question-answer dataset, utilizing advanced LLMs with human-in-the-loop and building upon human-generated raw data. Our comprehensive dataset comprises 305,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), covering various visual and multimodal aspects, including temporal comprehension, understanding human-object interactions, and reasoning about events or actions within a scene. Additionally, we fine-tuned open-source Video-LLMs on the training split and evaluated both open-source and proprietary video-centric LLMs on the test split of our dataset. The findings indicate that although current models underperform compared to humans, fine-tuning these models can lead to significant improvements in their performance.</description>
