      <title>Construction of the Complete Set of Maximally Entangled Basis Vectors for N-Qubit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we first use a three-qubit system as an example to demonstrate the construction of quantum circuits for the eight maximally entangled basis vectors, subsequently extending the approach to N-qubit systems. We employ a random-number approach to generate maximally entangled basis vectors and their corresponding circuits, while also detailing the required number of single-qubit and CNOT gates. This approach not only provides a solid theoretical foundation but also establishes a practical technique for technological applications, bypassing the difficulty of storing large-scale encoding data.</description>

      <title>Stress in chromium thin films deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on grounded cupper and stainless-steel substrate holders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromium thin films deposited on silicon substrates by DC magnetron sputtering were systematically investigated as a function of film thickness, using a DC power of 50 W and a post-deposition annealing temperature of 200 C. Two types of grounded substrate holders, copper and stainless steel, were employed to assess substrate-dependent effects. The intrinsic stress, determined by the wafer curvature method, decreases with increasing film thickness but increases with the annealing temperature. It is observed that for thinner as-deposited chromium films, the stress showed a pronounced irreversible increase when measured immediately after deposition and after several days of aging. Films deposited on copper holders consistently exhibited higher stress values than those grown on stainless steel holders. These observations suggest that the intrinsic stress in as-deposited films is linked to the growth mechanism, while the stress increase after annealing may be related to thermally active diffusion and structural relaxation. The higher stress in films grown on copper substrate holder can likely be associated with enhanced ion bombardment due to the higher electrical conductivity of copper.</description>

      <title>A Continuum Macro-Model for Bistable Periodic Auxetic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A macro-constitutive model for the deformation response of periodic rotating bistable auxetic surfaces is developed. Focus is placed on isotropic surfaces made of bistable hexagonal cells composed of six triangular units with two stable equilibrium states. Adopting a variational formulation, the effective stress-strain response is derived from a free energy function expressed in terms of the invariants of the logarithmic strain. A regularization of the governing equations via a gradient-enhanced first invariant of the logarithmic strain is introduced since the double-well nature of the free energy may result in mathematical ill-posedness and related numerical artifacts, such as mesh sensitivity. Despite this regularization, the numerical scheme may still suffer from divergence issues due to the highly non-linear material behavior. To enhance numerical stability, an artificial material rate-dependency is additionally introduced. Although it does not guarantee solution uniqueness or eliminate mesh sensitivity, it is conjectured to assist the numerical scheme in overcoming snap-backs caused by local non-proportional loading induced by transition fronts. The model is implemented using membrane/shell structural elements and plane stress continuum ones within the ABAQUS finite element suite. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation and its implementation.</description>

      <title>ME-FIRST: A Metasurface-Enhanced Fingerprint InfraRed Spectroscopic Tool for Fluid Analytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has emerged as a pivotal tool in biomedical diagnostics, offering label-free spectral biomarkers for the detection of numerous diseases, particularly in the fingerprint region. However, the lack of rapid and sensitive IR spectroscopic techniques for analyzing complex fluid analytes remains a critical challenge in clinical practice. To address this limitation, we present a Metasurface-Enhanced Fingerprint InfraRed Spectroscopic Tool (ME-FIRST) that enhances light-matter interactions in sub-wavelength volumes through plasmonic resonances across the entire fingerprint range from $1900 cm^{-1}$ to $1000 cm^{-1}$. Numerical simulations reveal confined and enhanced electric near-field, with an average probing depth of ~100 nm and enhancement factor $|E/E_0|$ of ~60-fold at resonant peaks. The ME-FIRST device is further experimentally fabricated and validated, and as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the sensing of molecular vibrational modes with a considerable sensitivity in L-lysine over the full fingerprint IR spectral range. The proposed ME-FIRST presents a promising platform for high-sensitivity IR spectroscopy of fluid analytes, paving the way for clinical applications of infrared spectroscopy in biofluid analysis and pathological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized magnetic-field sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19372v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a prime candidate for quantum sensing technologies. Here, we present a fully integrated and mechanically robust fiber-based endoscopic sensor with a tip diameter of $1.25 \mathrm{mm}$. On its tip, a direct laser writing process is used to fixate a diamond containing NV centers above the fiber's core inside a polymer structure. Additionally, a metallic direct laser-written antenna structure next to the fiber facet allows efficient microwave manipulation of NV center spins. The sensor achieves a shot-noise-limited magnetic-field sensitivity of $5.9 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ using a $15 \mathrm{\mu m}$-sized microdiamond at a microwave power of $50 \mathrm{mW}$ and optical power of $2.15 \mathrm{mW}$. Using lock-in techniques, we measure a sensitivity of $51.8 \mathrm{nT}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-fiber concept that enables, in combination with a direct laser-written structure, independent guiding of excitation and fluorescence light and thus reduces background autofluorescence. Moreover, controlled guiding of excitation light to the diamond while avoiding sample illumination may enable operation in light-sensitive environments such as biological tissue. While the demonstrated sensitivity is achieved using a single-fiber configuration, the dual-fiber approach provides a path towards integrating smaller diamonds, where autofluorescence would otherwise limit performance. We demonstrate the capability of vector magnetic field measurements in a magnetic field as used in state-of-the-art ultracold quantum gas experiments, opening a potential field in which high resolution and high sensitivity are necessary.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconducting properties of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ films with sub-50-nm thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review discusses the current applications, advantages, and limitations of PBPK and PopPK models in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). PBPK models simulate radiopharmaceutical kinetics by integrating prior physiological and drug parameter information, whereas PopPK models leverage population data to enhance individual dose estimation accuracy. Future directions include developing hybrid models, incorporating artificial intelligence, and establishing regulatory guidelines to promote their clinical adoption. Ultimately, these modeling strategies aim to enable precise, personalized RPT dosing, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and safety.</description>

      <title>Optimal Binning for Small-Angle Neutron Scattering Data Using the Freedman-Diaconis Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) data analysis often relies on fixed-width binning schemes that overlook variations in signal strength and structural complexity. We introduce a statistically grounded approach based on the Freedman-Diaconis (FD) rule, which minimizes the mean integrated squared error between the histogram estimate and the true intensity distribution. By deriving the competing scaling relations for counting noise ($\propto h^{-1}$) and binning distortion ($\propto h^{2}$), we establish an optimal bin width that balances statistical precision and structural resolution. Application to synthetic data from the Debye scattering function of a Gaussian polymer chain demonstrates that the FD criterion quantitatively determines the most efficient binning, faithfully reproducing the curvature of $I(Q)$ while minimizing random error. The optimal width follows the expected scaling $h_{\mathrm{opt}} \propto N_{\mathrm{total}}^{-1/3}$, delineating the transition between noise- and resolution-limited regimes. This framework provides a unified, physics-informed basis for adaptive, statistically efficient binning in neutron scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>All-Altermagnetic Tunnel Junction of RuO2/NiF2/RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>
