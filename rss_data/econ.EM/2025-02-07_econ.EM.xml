      <title>Type 2 Tobit Sample Selection Models with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Type 2 Tobit Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (TOBART-2). BART can produce accurate individual-specific treatment effect estimates. However, in practice estimates are often biased by sample selection. We extend the Type 2 Tobit sample selection model to account for nonlinearities and model uncertainty by including sums of trees in both the selection and outcome equations. A Dirichlet Process Mixture distribution for the error terms allows for departure from the assumption of bivariate normally distributed errors. Soft trees and a Dirichlet prior on splitting probabilities improve modeling of smooth and sparse data generating processes. We include a simulation study and an application to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment data set.</description>

      <title>Misspecification-Robust Shrinkage and Selection for VAR Forecasts and IRFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VARs are often estimated with Bayesian techniques to cope with model dimensionality. The posterior means define a class of shrinkage estimators, indexed by hyperparameters that determine the relative weight on maximum likelihood estimates and prior means. In a Bayesian setting, it is natural to choose these hyperparameters by maximizing the marginal data density. However, this is undesirable if the VAR is misspecified. In this paper, we derive asymptotically unbiased estimates of the multi-step forecasting risk and the impulse response estimation risk to determine hyperparameters in settings where the VAR is (potentially) misspecified. The proposed criteria can be used to jointly select the optimal shrinkage hyperparameter, VAR lag length, and to choose among different types of multi-step-ahead predictors; or among IRF estimates based on VARs and local projections. The selection approach is illustrated in a Monte Carlo study and an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Combining Clusters for the Approximate Randomization Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops procedures to combine clusters for the approximate randomization test proposed by Canay, Romano, and Shaikh (2017). Their test can be used to conduct inference with a small number of clusters and imposes weak requirements on the correlation structure. However, their test requires the target parameter to be identified within each cluster. A leading example where this requirement fails to hold is when a variable has no variation within clusters. For instance, this happens in difference-in-differences designs because the treatment variable equals zero in the control clusters. Under this scenario, combining control and treated clusters can solve the identification problem, and the test remains valid. However, there is an arbitrariness in how the clusters are combined. In this paper, I develop computationally efficient procedures to combine clusters when this identification requirement does not hold. Clusters are combined to maximize local asymptotic power. The simulation study and empirical application show that the procedures to combine clusters perform well in various settings.</description>

      <title>Quasi maximum likelihood estimation of high-dimensional approximate dynamic matrix factor models via the EM algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an approximate dynamic matrix factor model that accounts for the time series nature of the data by explicitly modelling the time evolution of the factors. We study Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimation of the model parameters based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented jointly with the Kalman smoother which gives estimates of the factors. This approach allows to easily handle arbitrary patterns of missing data. We establish the consistency of the estimated loadings and factor matrices as the sample size $T$ and the matrix dimensions $p_1$ and $p_2$ diverge to infinity. The finite sample properties of the estimators are assessed through a large simulation study and an application to a financial dataset of volatility proxies.</description>

      <title>A Multivariate Realized GARCH Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of multivariate GARCH models that incorporate realized measures of volatility and correlations. The key innovation is an unconstrained vector parametrization of the conditional correlation matrix, which enables the use of factor models for correlations. This approach elegantly addresses the main challenge faced by multivariate GARCH models in high-dimensional settings. As an illustration, we explore block correlation matrices that naturally simplify to linear factor models for the conditional correlations. The model is applied to the returns of nine assets, and its in-sample and out-of-sample performance compares favorably against several popular benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Identification- and many instrument-robust inference via invariant moment conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification-robust hypothesis tests are commonly based on the continuous updating GMM objective function. When the number of moment conditions grows proportionally with the sample size, the large-dimensional weighting matrix prohibits the use of conventional asymptotic approximations and the behavior of these tests remains unknown. We show that the structure of the weighting matrix opens up an alternative route to asymptotic results when, under the null hypothesis, the distribution of the moment conditions is reflection invariant. We provide several examples in which the invariance follows from standard assumptions. Our results show that existing tests will be asymptotically conservative, and we propose an adjustment to attain asymptotically nominal size. We illustrate our findings through simulations for various (non-)linear models, and an empirical application on the effect of the concentration of financial activities in banks on systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Merger Analysis with Latent Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07684v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard empirical tools for merger analysis assume price data, which are often unavailable. I characterize sufficient conditions for identifying the unilateral effects of mergers without price data using the first-order approach and merger simulation. Data on merging firms' revenues, margins, and revenue diversion ratios are sufficient to identify their gross upward pricing pressure indices and compensating marginal cost reductions. Standard discrete-continuous demand assumptions facilitate the identification of revenue diversion ratios as well as the feasibility of merger simulation in terms of percentage change in price. I apply the framework to the Albertsons/Safeway (2015) and Staples/Office Depot (2016) mergers.</description>

      <title>Identification and Inference in General Bunching Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an econometric framework and tools for the identification and inference of a structural parameter in general bunching designs. We present point and partial identification results, which generalize previous approaches in the literature. The key assumption for point identification is the analyticity of the counterfactual density, which defines a broader class of distributions than many commonly used parametric families. In the partial identification approach, the analyticity condition is relaxed and various inequality restrictions can be incorporated. Both of our identification approaches allow for observed covariates in the model, which has previously been permitted only in limited ways. These covariates allow us to account for observable factors that influence decisions regarding the running variable. We provide a suite of counterfactual estimation and inference methods, termed the generalized polynomial strategy. Our method restores the merits of the original polynomial strategy proposed by Chetty et al. (2011) while addressing several weaknesses in the widespread practice. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated compared to the polynomial estimator in a series of Monte Carlo studies within the augmented isoelastic model. We revisit the data used in Saez (2010) and find substantially different results relative to those from the polynomial strategy.</description>

      <title>The ARR2 prior: flexible predictive prior definition for Bayesian auto-regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the ARR2 prior, a joint prior over the auto-regressive components in Bayesian time-series models and their induced $R^2$. Compared to other priors designed for times-series models, the ARR2 prior allows for flexible and intuitive shrinkage. We derive the prior for pure auto-regressive models, and extend it to auto-regressive models with exogenous inputs, and state-space models. Through both simulations and real-world modelling exercises, we demonstrate the efficacy of the ARR2 prior in improving sparse and reliable inference, while showing greater inference quality and predictive performance than other shrinkage priors. An open-source implementation of the prior is provided.</description>

      <title>Scale-Insensitive Neural Network Significance Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a scale-insensitive framework for neural network significance testing, substantially generalizing existing approaches through three key innovations. First, we replace metric entropy calculations with Rademacher complexity bounds, enabling the analysis of neural networks without requiring bounded weights or specific architectural constraints. Second, we weaken the regularity conditions on the target function to require only Sobolev space membership $H^s([-1,1]^d)$ with $s &gt; d/2$, significantly relaxing previous smoothness assumptions while maintaining optimal approximation rates. Third, we introduce a modified sieve space construction based on moment bounds rather than weight constraints, providing a more natural theoretical framework for modern deep learning practices. Our approach achieves these generalizations while preserving optimal convergence rates and establishing valid asymptotic distributions for test statistics. The technical foundation combines localization theory, sharp concentration inequalities, and scale-insensitive complexity measures to handle unbounded weights and general Lipschitz activation functions. This framework better aligns theoretical guarantees with contemporary deep learning practice while maintaining mathematical rigor.</description>
