      <title>Scaling Laws and Convergence Dynamics in a Dissipative Kicked Rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kicked rotator model is an essential paradigm in nonlinear dynamics, helping us understand the emergence of chaos and bifurcations in dynamical systems. In this study, we analyze a two-dimensional kicked rotator model considering a homogeneous and generalized function approach to describe the convergence dynamics towards a stationary state. By examining the behavior of critical exponents and scaling laws, we demonstrate the universal nature of convergence dynamics. Specifically, we highlight the significance of the period-doubling bifurcation, showing that the critical exponents governing the convergence dynamics are consistent with those seen in other models.</description>

      <title>New type of chaotic solutions found in Gravity model of network transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravity model is a mathematical model that applies Newton's universal law of gravitation to socio-economic transport phenomena and has been widely used to describe world trade, intercity traffic flows, and business transactions for more than several decades. However, its strong nonlinearity and diverse network topology make a theoretical analysis difficult, and only a short history of studies on its stability exist. In this study, the stability of gravity models defined on networks with few nodes is analyzed in detail using numerical simulations. It was found that, other than the previously known transition of stationary solutions from a unique diffusion solution to multiple localized solutions, parameter regions exist where periodic solutions with the same repeated motions and chaotic solutions with no periods are realized. The smallest network with chaotic solutions was found to be a ring with seven nodes, which produced a new type of chaotic solution in the form of a mixture of right and left periodic solutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics near homoclinic orbits to a saddle in four-dimensional systems with a first integral and a discrete symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariant 4-dimensional system of ODEs with a smooth first integral $H$ and a saddle equilibrium state $O$. We assume that there exists a transverse homoclinic orbit $\Gamma$ to $O$ that approaches $O$ along the nonleading directions. Suppose $H(O) = c$. In \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(c)$ was described. In particular, some criteria for the existence of the stable and unstable invariant manifolds of $\Gamma$ were given. In the current paper, we describe the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(h)$ for $h\neq c$ close to $c$. We prove that when $h &lt; c$, there exists a unique saddle periodic orbit in each level set $H^{-1}(h)$, and the forward (resp. backward) orbit of any point off the stable (resp. unstable) invariant manifold of this periodic orbit leaves a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We further show that when $h &gt; c$, the forward and backward orbits of any point in $H^{-1}(h)$ near $\Gamma$ leave a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We also prove analogous results for the scenario where two transverse homoclinics to $O$ (homoclinic figure-eight) exist. The results of this paper, together with \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, give a full description of the dynamics in a small open neighborhood of $\Gamma$ (and a small open neighborhood of a homoclinic figure-eight).</description>

      <title>A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</description>

      <title>Extreme events at the onset of epileptic-like chimeras in small-world networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of complex networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable oscillators, focusing on the impact of coupling strength, network size, and randomness on their collective dynamics. Considering Watts-Strogatz small-world network connectivities, the system exhibits three distinct dynamical phases: chaotic, intermittent, and synchronized, with the intermittent phase displaying transient, epileptic-like chimera states. We analyse the transition to synchronisation by means of the master stability function, and show that peaks in the proportion of extreme events of synchronisation, which correlate with the behaviour of the largest Lyapunov exponent of the system, precede the transitions between the distinct dynamical regimes and mark the onset of epileptic-like chimera states. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of synchronisation in excitable systems real neural networks and offer insights into the conditions that may lead to pathological epileptic-like states. Furthermore, we discus the potential use of extreme events to study real neural data.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in galactic potentials under mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer occurs between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body lattice systems via spectra of a momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into the decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions due to an almost conserved operator. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>
