      <title>Quark-Quark and Quark-nucleon Potential model Extended-soft-core meson-exchange Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quark-quark (QQ) and Quark-nucleon (QN) interactions in this paper are derived from the Extended-soft-core (ESC) interactions. The meson-quark-quark (MQQ) vertices are determined in the framework of the constituent quark model (CQM). These vertices are such that upon folding with the ground-state baryon quark wave functions the one-boson-exchange (OBE) amplitudes for baryon-baryon (BB), and in particularly for nucleon-nucleon (NN), are reproduced. This opens the attractive possibility to define meson-quark interactions at the quark level which are directly related related to the interactions at the baryon level. the latter have been determined by the baryon-baryon data. Application of these "realistic" quark-quark interactions in the quark-matter phase is presumably of relevance for the description of highly condensed matter, as e.g. neutron-star matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron star properties through parity-violating electron scattering experiments and relativistic point coupling interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity-violating electron scattering experiments on $\rm ^{48}Ca$ (CREX) and $\rm ^{208}Pb$ (PREX-II) offer valuable insight into the isovector properties of finite nuclei, providing constraints for the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we establish functional dependencies between the properties of finite nuclei - such as weak charge form factors and neutron skin thickness - and the bulk properties of neutron stars, including tidal deformability from binary neutron star mergers and neutron star radii. The dependencies are formulated by introducing a family of $\beta$-equilibrated equations of state based on relativistic energy density functionals with point coupling interactions. The charge minus the weak form factors derived from CREX and PREX-II measurements, combined with the observational constraints on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, are used to constrain the symmetry energy and neutron star radii. Notably, the energy density expanded up to the fourth order in symmetry energy yields larger radii compared to calculations limited to the second order term. However, the results reveal a discrepancy between the constraints provided by the CREX and PREX-II experiments. For a more quantitative assessment, higher precision parity-violating electron scattering data and neutron star observations are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the status of baryon form factors with a special focus on the nucleon electromagnetic form factors which are known best. First, we give an introduction into the dispersive analyses and emphasize the role of unitarity and analyticity in the construction of the isoscalar and isovector spectral functions. Second, we present the state of the art in our understanding of nucleon form factors and radii including reliable uncertainty estimates from bootstrap and Bayesian methods. Third, we discuss the physics of the time-like form factors and point out further issues to be addressed in this framework. Finally, we review the status of hyperon form factors and comment on the pion cloud.</description>

      <title>Global parameterizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering with dispersive constraints: beyond the S0 wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide new global parameterizations of $\pi\pi$ scattering for the S2, P, D, F, and G partial waves up to at least 1.8 GeV, easy to implement for phenomenological use. With earlier S0-wave parameterizations, slightly updated here, they reproduce previous partial wave dispersion analyses up to the $\pi\omega$ threshold. In addition, these new parameterizations have improved their description of recent P-wave data, the inelasticity in various waves, and their fulfillment of Roy-like and forward dispersion relations. The latter now test very high partial waves and have an improved matching with the Regge regime, extending those with P-wave contributions up to 1.6 GeV. Above 1.6 GeV and up to 1.8 GeV, or sometimes somewhat beyond, the parameterizations are simple unconstrained fits to data.</description>

      <title>Correlations of net baryon number and electric charge in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correlations between net baryon number and electric charge up to sixth order related to the interactions of nuclear matter at low temperature, and explore their relationship with the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition (LGPT) within the framework of the nonlinear Walecka model. The calculation shows that strong correlations between the baryon number and electric charge exist in the vicinity of LGPT, and the higher order correlations are more sensitive than the lower order ones near the phase transition. However, in the high-temperature region away from the LGPT the rescaled lower order correlations are relatively larger than most of the higher order ones. Besides, some of the fifth- and sixth-order correlations possibly change the sign from negative to positive along the chemical freeze-out line with the decrease of temperature. In combination with the future experimental projects at lower collision energies, the derived results can be referred to study the phase structure of strongly interacting matter and analyze the related experimental signals.</description>

      <title>The QCD moat regime and its real-time properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense QCD matter may exhibit crystalline phases. Their existence is reflected in a moat regime, where mesonic correlations feature spatial modulations. We study the realtime properties of pions at finite temperature and density in QCD in order to elucidate the nature of this regime. We show that the moat regime arises from particle-hole-like fluctuations near the Fermi surface. This gives rise to a characteristic peak in the spectral function of the pion at nonzero \emph{spacelike} momentum. This peak can be interpreted as a new quasi particle, the moaton. In addition, our framework also allows us to directly test the stability of the homogeneous chiral phase against the formation of an inhomogeneous condensate in QCD. We find that the formation of such a phase is highly unlikely for baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B \leq 630$\,MeV.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass effects in off-light-cone distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop correction to the forward matrix element of an off-light-cone bi-local quark correlator characterised by a space-like separation $z^2$ in the presence of heavy quarks with mass $m$. This calculation allows us to extract the one-loop matching kernel, necessary to connect quasi and pseudo-distributions to collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), accounting for heavy-quark mass effects. Our result is exact in that it includes all powers of $z^2m^2$ at one loop in $\alpha_s$. In the limit $z^2m^2\rightarrow 0$, it consistently reduces to the known massless result. We also carry out an implementation of our expression, which allows us to compute the charm pseudo-distribution of the proton given its PDF. We finally comment on the quantitative impact of heavy-quark mass corrections.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization of QCD in $1 + 1$ dimensions: four-fermion interactions from quark-gluon dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. We use a functional formulation with covariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the gauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local fermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of quark matter and in-medium properties of mesons from Callan-Symanzik flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute meson spectral functions at finite temperature and density in the quark-meson model, supplemented with a computation of the phase diagram. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of the non-analytic structure of the meson two-point functions which is of great relevance for phenomenological applications, such as moat regimes and inhomogeneous phases. Furthermore, it is also relevant from a field-theoretical standpoint as it provides an insight into the applicability of derivative expansions of the effective action to studies of general fermion-boson models, both at zero and finite chemical potential. Our computation is based on a functional renormalization group setup that preserves causality, all spacetime symmetries, and the Silver-Blaze property. The combination of these properties can only be achieved by a Callan-Symanzik regulator. Instead of momentum shell integrations, renormalization group flows generated by such a regulator describe the change of the theory induced by a change of the masses of the mesons and quarks. A particular focus of our work lies on the construction of controlled Callan-Symanzik flows in the presence of spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking by means of chiral Ward-Takahashi identities.</description>

      <title>The art of modeling nuclear reactions with weakly bound nuclei: status and perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an overview of the theoretical description of nuclear reactions involving weakly-bound nuclei. Some of the more widespread reaction formalisms employed in the analysis of these reactions are briefly introduced, including various recent developments. We put special emphasis on the continuum-discretized coupled-channel (CDCC) method and its extensions to incorporate core and target excitations as well as its application to three-body projectiles. The role of the continuum for one-nucleon transfer reactions is also discussed. The problem of the evaluation of inclusive breakup cross sections is addressed within the Ichimura-Austern-Vincent (IAV) model. Other methods, such as those based on a semiclasical description of the scattering process, are also briefly introduced and some of their applications are discussed and a brief discussion on topics of current interest, such as nucleon-nucleon correlations, uncertainty evaluation and non-locality is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining the femtoscopic interferometry and the optical deblurring algorithm, we implement a novel method to image the source formed in heavy ion collisions (HICs), while the interaction strength between the particle pair can be determined simultaneously. By applying this method to Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{S_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, the spatial distribution of the emission source has been reconstructed for protons ($p$) and antiprotons ($\bar{p}$) from the respective $pp$ and $\bar{p}\bar{p}$ correlation functions. Within experimental uncertainties, protons and antiprotons share the same freeze-out distribution showing higher density in the center compared to the widely assumed Gaussian shape. The results evidence the matter-antimatter symmetry in coordinate space at the moment of freeze-out before the nucleons are fully randomized in the collisions.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of nuclear remnants in electron-nucleus collisions at high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the various internal structures of an excited nucleus can lead to different topological configurations of nuclear fragments during fragmentation. However, these internal structures may transition from one configuration to another with varying probabilities. Utilizing a partitioning method based on equal (or unequal) probabilities -- without incorporating the alpha-cluster ($\alpha$-cluster) model -- allows for the derivation of diverse topological configurations of nuclear fragments resulting from fragmentation. Subsequently, we predict the multiplicity distribution of nuclear fragments for specific excited nuclei, such as $^9$Be$^*$, $^{12}$C$^*$, and $^{16}$O$^*$, which can be formed as nuclear remnants in electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at high energy. According to the $\alpha$-cluster model, an $\alpha$-cluster structure should take precedence among different internal structures; this may result in deviations in the multiplicity distributions of nuclear fragments with charge $Z=2$, compared to those predicted by the partitioning methods. The findings presented herein could serve as a reference for validating the existence of $\alpha$-cluster structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the modeling of the hadronic phase of QCD at finite magnetic field in the framework of hadron resonance gas (HRG). We focus on the statistical description of particle yields that include contribution from resonance decays. We demonstrate that the swift increase in the number of protons with magnetic field predicted in the HRG is due to the ill-defined description of higher-spin states. We discuss fluctuations of conserved charges and show that at present the qualitative comparison of the model predictions with the Lattice QCD data should be treated with care. We also discuss the principle of detailed balance which allows to study the magnetic field dependence of neutral resonances.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors in kinetic theory for a mixture of quark and gluon fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exactly solve an RTA-Boltzmann equation that describes the dynamics of coupled massless quark and gluon fluids undergoing transversally homogeneous longitudinal boost-invariant expansion. We include a fugacity parameter that allows quarks to be out of chemical equilibrium and we account for the different collision rates of quarks and gluons, which are related by Casimir scaling. Based on these assumptions, we numerically determine the evolution of a large set of moments of the quark and gluon distribution functions and reconstruct their entire distribution functions. We find that both late and early-time attractors exist for all moments of the distribution functions containing more than one power of the squared longitudinal momentum. These attractors emerge long before the system reaches the regime where hydrodynamic approximations apply. In addition, we discuss how the shear viscous corrections and entropy density of the fluid mixture evolve and consider the properties of their respective attractors. Finally, the entropy production is also investigated for different initial values of momentum anisotropy and quark abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a formalism to compute spatial $n$-point correlations of a conserved charge density in a large thermal system in the canonical ensemble, with explicit results presented up to 4th order. The resulting correlators contain local and balancing terms expressed through the grand-canonical susceptibilities for any equation of state. The new formalism is used to introduce a Gaussian local baryon number conservation in (spatial) rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at LHC conditions through a modulation of the balancing term. Connection to the conservation volume $V_c$ approach is established, indicating that the latter is appropriate for observables within a limited range around midrapidity. Quantitative analysis of the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration on net proton cumulants in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV shows significant evidence for local baryon conservation.</description>

      <title>Magnetized neutral 2SC color superconductivity and possible origin of the inner magnetic field of magnetars</title>

Abstract: In this paper the neutral 2SC phase of color superconductivity is investigated in the presence of a magnetic field and for diquark coupling constants and baryonic densities that are expected to characterize neutron stars. Specifically, the behavior of the charged gluons Meissner masses is investigated in the parameter region of interest taking into account, in addition, the contribution of a rotated magnetic field. It is found that up to moderately-high diquark coupling constants the mentioned Meissner masses become tachyonic independently of the applied magnetic-field amplitude, hence signalizing the chromomagnetic instability of this phase. To remove the instability, the restructuring of the system ground state is proposed, which now will be formed by vortices of the rotated charged gluons. These vortices boost the applied magnetic field having the most significant increase for relatively low applied magnetic fields. Finally, considering that with the stellar rotational frequency observed for magnetars a field of the order of $10^8$ G can be generated by dynamo effect, we show that by the boosting effect just described the field can be amplified to $10^{17}$ G that is in the range of inner core fields expected for magnetars. Thus, we conclude that the described mechanism could be the one responsible for the large fields characterizing magnetars if the cores of these compact objects are formed by neutral 2SC matter.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new long-lived isomer in $^{114}$Rh via Penning-trap mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on mass measurements of three long-lived states in $^{114}$Rh performed with the JYFLTRAP Penning-trap mass spectrometer: the ground state and two isomers with estimated half-lives of about one second. The used Phase-Imaging Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance technique allowed for the discovery of a so far unknown second long-lived isomer. All three states were produced directly in proton-induced fission on a uranium target, whereas only the isomeric states were populated in the $\beta$ decay of the $^{114}$Ru ground state with spin-parity $0^+$. We propose spin-parity assignments of $(6^-)$ for the ground state, and $(3^+)$ and $(0^-)$ for the isomers. They resolve the puzzle of anomalous fission yields of this isotope despite the existing literature assigning a low angular momentum to the ground state. The experimental evidence is further supported by a detailed analysis based on mean-field calculations with the BSkG3 model. As for many other nuclei in this mass region, considering triaxial shapes is decisive for the interpretation of low-lying states of this nucleus. The discovery of a new isomer in $^{114}$Rh and our theoretical work challenge the currently adopted spin-parity assignments in this and several other odd-odd neutron-rich Rh isotopes.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>
