      <title>Cryogenic Characterization of Ferroelectric Non-volatile Capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric-based capacitive crossbar arrays have been proposed for energy-efficient in-memory computing in the charge domain. They combat the challenges like sneak paths and high static power faced by resistive crossbar arrays but are susceptible to thermal noise limiting the effective number of bits (ENOB) for the weighted sum. A direct way to reduce this thermal noise is by lowering the temperature as thermal noise is proportional to temperature. In this work, we first characterize the non-volatile capacitors (nvCaps) on a foundry 28 nm platform at cryogenic temperatures to evaluate the memory window, ON state retention as a function of temperature down to 77K, and then use the calibrated device models to simulate the capacitive crossbar arrays in SPICE at lower temperatures to demonstrate higher ENOB (~5 bits) for 128x128 multiple-and-accumulate (MAC) operations.</description>

      <title>Modulation Schemes for Functionalized Vesicle-based MC Transmitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information exchange through the transmission of signaling molecules (SMs) and holds promise for many innovative applications. However, most existing MC studies rely on simplified transmitter (TX) models that do not account for the physical and biochemical limitations of realistic biological hardware. This work extends previous efforts toward developing models for practical MC systems by proposing a more realistic TX model that incorporates the delay in SM release and TX noise introduced by biological components. Building on this more realistic, functionalized vesicle-based TX model, we propose two novel modulation schemes specifically designed for this TX to mitigate TX-induced memory effects that arise from delayed and imperfectly controllable SM release. The proposed modulation schemes enable low-complexity receiver designs by mitigating memory effects directly at the TX. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed schemes improve communication reliability under realistic biochemical constraints, offering an important step toward physically realizable MC systems.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Entropy Analog Computing Approaching ExaOPS-per-Watt Energy-efficiency at the RF-Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how the physics of entropy production, when combined with symmetry constraints, can be used for implementing high-performance and energy-efficient analog computing systems. At the core of the proposed framework is a generalized maximum-entropy principle that can describe the evolution of a mesoscopic physical system formed by an interconnected ensemble of analog elements, including devices that can be readily fabricated on standard integrated circuit technology. We show that the maximum-entropy state of this ensemble corresponds to a margin-propagation (MP) distribution and can be used for computing correlations and inner products as the ensemble's macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the limits of computational throughput and energy efficiency can be pushed by extending the framework to non-equilibrium or transient operating conditions, which we demonstrate using a proof-of-concept radio-frequency (RF) correlator integrated circuit fabricated in a 22 nm SOI CMOS process. The measured results show a compute efficiency greater than 2 Peta ($10^{15}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (PetaOPS/W) at 8-bit precision and greater than 0.8 Exa ($10^{18}$) Bit Operations per second per Watt (ExaOPS/W) at 3-bit precision for RF data sampled at rates greater than 4 GS/s. Using the fabricated prototypes, we also showcase several real-world RF applications at the edge, including spectrum sensing, and code-domain communications.</description>

      <title>Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.</description>

      <title>Learning with Calibration: Exploring Test-Time Computing of Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in many domains, such as transportation, meteorology, and energy. However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behaviour classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviours such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioural analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</description>
