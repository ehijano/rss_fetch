      <title>Dynamic Unit-Disk Range Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a value $r &gt; 0$, the unit-disk range reporting problem is to construct a data structure so that given any query disk of radius $r$, all points of $P$ in the disk can be reported efficiently. We consider the dynamic version of the problem where point insertions and deletions of $P$ are allowed. The previous best method provides a data structure of $O(n\log n)$ space that supports $O(\log^{3+\epsilon}n)$ amortized insertion time, $O(\log^{5+\epsilon}n)$ amortized deletion time, and $O(\log^2 n/\log\log n+k)$ query time, where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant and $k$ is the output size. In this paper, we improve the query time to $O(\log n+k)$ while keeping other complexities the same as before. A key ingredient of our approach is a shallow cutting algorithm for circular arcs, which may be interesting in its own right. A related problem that can also be solved by our techniques is the dynamic unit-disk range emptiness queries: Given a query unit disk, we wish to determine whether the disk contains a point of $P$. The best previous work can maintain $P$ in a data structure of $O(n)$ space that supports $O(\log^2 n)$ amortized insertion time, $O(\log^4n)$ amortized deletion time, and $O(\log^2 n)$ query time. Our new data structure also uses $O(n)$ space but can support each update in $O(\log^{1+\epsilon} n)$ amortized time and support each query in $O(\log n)$ time.</description>

      <title>Dominating Set, Independent Set, Discrete $k$-Center, Dispersion, and Related Problems for Planar Points in Convex Position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, its unit-disk graph $G(P)$ is a graph with $P$ as its vertex set such that two points of $P$ are connected by an edge if their (Euclidean) distance is at most $1$. We consider several classical problems on $G(P)$ in a special setting when points of $P$ are in convex position. These problems are all NP-hard in the general case. We present efficient algorithms for these problems under the convex position assumption. The considered problems include the following: finding a minimum weight dominating set in $G(P)$, the discrete $k$-center problem for $P$, finding a maximum weight independent set in $G(P)$, the dispersion problem for $P$, and several of their variations. For some of these problems, our algorithms improve the previously best results, while for others, our results provide first-known solutions.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of Self-Organized Aggregation without Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Gauci et al. (2014) studied the fundamental task of aggregation, wherein multiple robots need to gather without an a priori agreed-upon meeting location, using minimal hardware. That paper considered differential-drive robots that are memoryless and unable to compute. Moreover, the robots cannot communicate with one another and are only equipped with a simple sensor that determines whether another robot is directly in front of them. Despite those severe limitations, Gauci et al. introduced a controller and proved mathematically that it aggregates a system of two robots for any initial state. Unfortunately, for larger systems, the same controller aggregates empirically in many cases but not all. Thus, the question of whether a controller exists that aggregates for any number of robots remains open. In this paper, we show that no such controller exists by investigating the geometric structure of controllers. In addition, we disprove the aggregation proof of the paper above for two robots and present an alternative controller alongside a simple and rigorous aggregation proof.</description>

      <title>Ortho-Radial Drawing in Near-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orthogonal drawing is an embedding of a plane graph into a grid. In a seminal work of Tamassia (SIAM Journal on Computing 1987), a simple combinatorial characterization of angle assignments that can be realized as bend-free orthogonal drawings was established, thereby allowing an orthogonal drawing to be described combinatorially by listing the angles of all corners. The characterization reduces the need to consider certain geometric aspects, such as edge lengths and vertex coordinates, and simplifies the task of graph drawing algorithm design.
  Barth, Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2017) established an analogous combinatorial characterization for ortho-radial drawings, which are a generalization of orthogonal drawings to cylindrical grids. The proof of the characterization is existential and does not result in an efficient algorithm. Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2019) later addressed this issue by developing quadratic-time algorithms for both testing the realizability of a given angle assignment as an ortho-radial drawing without bends and constructing such a drawing.
  In this paper, we further improve the time complexity of these tasks to near-linear time. We establish a new characterization for ortho-radial drawings based on the concept of a good sequence. Using the new characterization, we design a simple greedy algorithm for constructing ortho-radial drawings.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Efficient Approximation Schemes on Geometric Packing Problems of $d$-dimensional Fat Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate approximation algorithms for several fundamental optimization problems on geometric packing. The geometric objects considered are very generic, namely $d$-dimensional convex fat objects. Our main contribution is a versatile framework for designing efficient approximation schemes for classic geometric packing problems. The framework effectively addresses problems such as the multiple knapsack, bin packing, multiple strip packing, and multiple minimum container problems. Furthermore, the framework handles additional problem features, including item multiplicity, item rotation, and additional constraints on the items commonly encountered in packing contexts. The core of our framework lies in formulating the problems as integer programs with a nearly decomposable structure. This approach enables us to obtain well-behaved fractional solutions, which can then be efficiently rounded. By modeling the problems in this manner, our framework offers significant flexibility, allowing it to address a wide range of problems and incorporate additional features. To the best of our knowledge, prior to this work, the known results on approximation algorithms for packing problems were either highly fixed for one problem or restricted to one class of objects, mainly polygons and hypercubes. In this sense, our framework is the first result with a general toolbox flavor in the context of approximation algorithms for geometric packing problems. Thus, we believe that our technique is of independent interest, being possible to inspire further work on geometric packing.</description>

      <title>Initial Placement for Fruchterman--Reingold Force Model with Coordinate Newton Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph drawing is a fundamental task in information visualization, with the Fruchterman--Reingold (FR) force model being one of the most popular choices. We can interpret this visualization task as a continuous optimization problem, which can be solved using the FR algorithm, the original algorithm for this force model, or the L-BFGS algorithm, a quasi-Newton method. However, both algorithms suffer from twist problems and are computationally expensive per iteration, which makes achieving high-quality visualizations for large-scale graphs challenging. In this research, we propose a new initial placement based on the stochastic coordinate descent to accelerate the optimization process. We first reformulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem using a hexagonal lattice and then iteratively update a randomly selected vertex along the coordinate Newton direction. We can use the FR or L-BFGS algorithms to obtain the final placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through experiments, highlighting the potential of coordinate descent methods for graph drawing tasks. Additionally, we suggest combining our method with other graph drawing techniques for further improvement. We also discuss the relationship between our proposed method and broader graph-related applications.</description>
