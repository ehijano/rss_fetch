      <title>Orbitopal Fixing in SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their sophisticated heuristics, boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers are still vulnerable to symmetry, causing them to visit search regions that are symmetric to ones already explored. While symmetry handling is routine in other solving paradigms, integrating it into state-of-the-art proof-producing SAT solvers is difficult: added reasoning must be fast, non-interfering with solver heuristics, and compatible with formal proof logging. To address these issues, we present a practical static symmetry breaking approach based on orbitopal fixing, a technique adapted from mixed-integer programming. Our approach adds only unit clauses, which minimizes downstream slowdowns, and it emits succinct proof certificates in the substitution redundancy proof system. Implemented in the satsuma tool, our methods deliver consistent speedups on symmetry-rich benchmarks with negligible regressions elsewhere.</description>

      <title>On the logical structure of choice and bar induction principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.08951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an approach to choice principles and their contrapositive bar-induction principles as extensionality schemes connecting an ''intensional'' or ''effective'' view of respectively ill-and well-foundedness properties to an ''extensional'' or ''ideal'' view of these properties. After classifying and analysing the relations between different intensional definitions of ill-foundedness and well-foundedness, we introduce, for a domain $A$, a codomain $B$ and a ''filter'' $T$ on finite approximations of functions from $A$ to $B$, a generalised form GDC$_{A,B,T}$ of the axiom of dependent choice and dually a generalised bar induction principle GBI$_{A,B,T}$ such that: - GDC$_{A,B,T}$ intuitionistically captures the strength of $\bullet$ the general axiom of choice expressed as $\forall a\exists\beta R(a, b) \Rightarrow\exists\alpha\forall a R(\alpha,(a \alpha (a)))$ when $T$ is a filter that derives point-wise from a relation $R$ on $A x B$ without introducing further constraints, $\bullet$ the Boolean Prime Filter Theorem / Ultrafilter Theorem if $B$ is the two-element set $\mathbb{B}$ (for a constructive definition of prime filter), $\bullet$ the axiom of dependent choice if $A = \mathbb{N}$, $\bullet$ Weak K{\"o}nig's Lemma if $A = \mathbb{N}$ and $B = \mathbb{B}$ (up to weak classical reasoning) - GBI$_{A,B,T}$ intuitionistically captures the strength of $\bullet$ G{\"o}del's completeness theorem in the form validity implies provability for entailment relations if $B = \mathbb{B}$, $\bullet$ bar induction when $A = \mathbb{N}$, $\bullet$ the Weak Fan Theorem when $A = \mathbb{N}$ and $B = \mathbb{B}$. Contrastingly, even though GDC$_{A,B,T}$ and GBI$_{A,B,T}$ smoothly capture several variants of choice and bar induction, some instances are inconsistent, e.g. when $A$ is $\mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N}$ and $B$ is $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Compositional Verification of Concurrency Using Past-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared-memory concurrency is difficult to reason about because each thread executes under interference from other threads. At the same time, many correctness arguments for classic algorithms are epistemic: a thread enters a critical region only when, from its local view, it can rule out that another thread is concurrently in that region. We make such arguments explicit by introducing a past-time temporal epistemic logic interpreted over interleaving executions with perfect-recall local histories. Past-time operators support "since" reasoning, while epistemic modalities capture what a given thread can conclude from its own observation history. We give semantics and a sound proof system, instantiate the logic to a simple shared-memory language with instrumented read/write observations, and illustrate the approach on Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm by proving a local knowledge condition that implies mutual exclusion.</description>

      <title>On the $p$-adic Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks to determine whether a given linear recurrence sequence (LRS) has a zero term. Showing decidability of this problem is equivalent to giving an effective proof of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech Theorem, which asserts that a non-degenerate LRS has finitely many zeros. The latter result was proven over 90 years ago via an ineffective method showing that such an LRS has only finitely many $p$-adic zeros. In this paper we consider the problem of determining whether a given LRS has a $p$-adic zero, as well as the corresponding function problem of computing exact representations of all $p$-adic zeros. We present algorithms for both problems and report on their implementation. The output of the algorithms is unconditionally correct, and termination is guaranteed subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture (a standard number-theoretic hypothesis concerning the $p$-adic exponential function). While these algorithms do not solve the Skolem Problem, they can be exploited to find natural-number and rational zeros under additional hypotheses. To illustrate this, we apply our results to show decidability of the Simultaneous Skolem Problem (determine whether two coprime linear recurrences have a common natural-number zero), again subject to the $p$-adic Schanuel Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Expectation-based Analysis of Higher-Order Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper extends the expectation transformer based analysis of higher-order probabilistic programs to the quantum higher-order setting. The quantum language we are considering can be seen as an extension of PCF, featuring unbounded recursion. The language admits classical and quantum data, as well as a tick operator to account for costs. Our quantum expectation transformer translates such programs into a functional, non-quantum language, enriched with a type and operations over so called cost-structures. By specializing the cost-structure, this methodology makes it possible to study several expectation based properties of quantum programs, such as average case cost, probabilities of events or expected values, in terms of the translated non-quantum programs, this way enabling classical reasoning techniques. As a show-case, we adapt a refinement type system, capable of reasoning on upper-bounds.</description>

      <title>Strong Normalization for the Safe Fragment of a Minimal Rewrite System: A Triple-Lexicographic Proof and a Conjecture on the Unprovability of Full Termination for Any Relational Operator-Only TRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a minimal operator-only term rewriting system with seven constructors and eight reduction rules. The main contribution is a mechanically-verified proof of strong normalization for a guarded fragment using a novel triple-lexicographic measure combining a phase bit, multiset ordering (Dershowitz-Manna), and ordinal ranking. From strong normalization, a certified normalizer with proven totality and soundness is derived. Assuming local confluence (verified through critical pair analysis), Newman's Lemma yields confluence and therefore unique normal forms for the safe fragment. Impossibility results showing that simpler measures, such as additive counters, polynomial interpretations, and single-bit flags, provably fail for rules with term duplication, are established. The work demonstrates fundamental limitations in termination proving for self-referential systems. A conjecture is stated: no relational operator-only TRS can have its full-system termination proved by internally definable methods. Here "relational" is equivalent to "capable of ordered computation": systems with a recursor enabling iteration over successors, comparison, or sequential counting. Such recursors necessarily redistribute step arguments across recursive calls, defeating all additive termination measures. This structural limitation applies to any TRS expressive enough to encode ordered data. All theorems have been formally verified in a proof assistant. The Lean formalization is available at https://github.com/MosesRahnama/OperatorKO7.</description>

      <title>Logical Expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Node Individualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and study Hierarchical Ego Graph Neural Networks (HEGNNs), an expressive extension of graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical node individualization, inspired by the Individualization-Refinement paradigm for isomorphism testing. HEGNNs generalize subgraph-GNNs and form a hierarchy of increasingly expressive models that, in the limit, distinguish graphs up to isomorphism. We show that, over graphs of bounded degree, the separating power of HEGNN node classifiers equals that of graded hybrid logic. This characterization enables us to relate the separating power of HEGNNs to that of higher-order GNNs, GNNs enriched with local homomorphism count features, and color refinement algorithms based on Individualization-Refinement. Our experimental results confirm the practical feasibility of HEGNNs and show benefits in comparison with traditional GNN architectures, both with and without local homomorphism count features.</description>

      <title>Neural Logic Networks for Interpretable Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08172v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on examples from the medical and industrial fields where interpretability has tangible value.</description>

      <title>Outrunning Big KATs: Efficient Decision Procedures for Variants of GKAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents several efficient decision procedures for trace equivalence of GKAT automata, which make use of on-the-fly symbolic techniques via SAT solvers. To demonstrate applicability of our algorithms, we designed symbolic derivatives for CF-GKAT, a practical system based on GKAT designed to validate control-flow transformations. We implemented the algorithms in Rust and evaluated them on both randomly generated benchmarks and real-world control-flow transformations. Indeed, we observed order-of-magnitude performance improvements against existing implementations for both KAT and CF-GKAT. Notably, our experiments also revealed a bug in Ghidra, an industry-standard decompiler, highlighting the practical viability of these systems.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs. We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $\mathsf{AW}[*]\neq \mathsf{FPT}$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>
