      <title>Evolution of protein$-$RNA interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the Hadean era of Earth's history, peptides/proteins and RNA have undergone a complex evolutionary trajectory. Originating from simple monomeric units, these molecules evolved abiotically under various biochemical and biophysical constraints into functional biomolecules that contributed to the emergence of the first living cells. Within these cells, their interactions could then evolve through Darwinian selection. In this review, we examine current understanding of how protein$-$RNA interactions emerged under prebiotic conditions and developed into today's iconic biomolecular machines such as the ribosome. Particular emphasis is placed on the types of physicochemical interactions accessible to early protein$-$RNA complexes and their roles in driving spatial organization and compartmentalization in protocellular environments.</description>

      <title>Liapunov exponent distributions and maps for multiple parameter logistic equation. Application to DNA and RNA sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple parameter logistic equation has previously been utilized to determine the global stability of ternary codes, based on the arrangement of different symbols within the code. This approach has been extended to DNA and RNA sequences, proposing a specific application in the context of reading and translation processes involved in DNA replication and RNA-mediated protein codification. To address the complexity of mapping Liapunov exponents in terms of four parameters representing the different nucleotide bases specialized mapping techniques have been developed. These include Liapunov exponent distributions for entire sequences, as well as binary maps that classify nucleotide bases based on their chemical type (purinic or pyrimidinic). Such methodologies provide a framework for examining the structural and functional properties of genetic material. The sequences analyzed encompass a wide range of DNA and RNA types, including those with and without introns, as well as codifying and noncodifying regions. This multifaceted approach offers valuable insights into the dynamic behavior and stability of nucleotide arrangements, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes that govern genetic replication and protein synthesis.</description>

      <title>Metamorphosis of collective patterns modulated by non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study memoryless active particles that navigate using visual information. Particle perception is limited by a field of view. As the degree of non-reciprocity in interactions is varied, we can observe the emergence of a zoology of complex collective motion patterns that exhibit significantly different topologies and transport properties. Nematic closed filaments in the form of rings move as chiral active particles. Closed polar filaments with one singular topological point move ballistically, while those with two singular topological points rotate. Open polar filaments behave as persistent random walks. Furthermore, by changing the size of the field of view, we explore the metamorphic process that transforms one structure into another, finding that the process is non-reversible and presents strong hysteric effects. The analysis sheds light on the physics of single-species active particles with non-reciprocal interactions, providing evidence that topological and transport properties are closely related.</description>

      <title>Chirality-bolstered quantum Zeno effect enhances radical pair-based magnetoreception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radical pairs in the flavoprotein cryptochrome are central to various magnetically sensitive biological processes, including the proposed mechanism of avian magnetoreception. Cryptochrome's molecular chirality has been hypothesized to enhance magnetic field effects via the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, yet the mechanism underlying this enhancement remains unresolved. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of CISS on the directional magnetic sensitivity of prototypical radical pair reactions, analyzing two distinct models--one generating spin polarization and, for the first time, one generating coherence. We find that CISS-induced spin polarization significantly enhances magnetic sensitivity by introducing triplet character into the initial state and reinforcing the quantum Zeno effect, paralleling enhancements observed in triplet-born radical pairs subject to strongly asymmetric recombination. In contrast, CISS-generated spin coherence does not provide a significant improvement in sensitivity. These findings indicate that CISS is not itself a universal enhancer of sensitivity or coherence in radical-pair reactions, and its influence must be evaluated case by case, particularly in relation to the quantum Zeno effect. Additionally, we provide a unified interpolation scheme for modeling CISS-influenced initial states and recombination dynamics, encompassing the principal models currently discussed in the literature for singlet and triplet precursors.</description>

      <title>Myosin-driven advection and actin reorganization control the geometry of confined actomyosin gel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing nanoscale motor proteins to actively control material shape is a promising strategy in nanotechnology and material science. One notable system is the actomyosin network, composed of actin filaments and myosin motor proteins, providing a natural platform for constructing contractile, shape-adaptive materials. While the role of actomyosin in shaping cells has been extensively studied, the reverse question - how boundary shape affects the actomyosin system - remains poorly understood. Here, we present a microfabricated system that reveals how geometrical confinement directs the organization of actomyosin networks within microwells. By combining experimental and numerical analysis, we show that the asymmetric shape of the microwells is transferred to contracted actomyosin gels via myosin-driven actin flow. Furthermore, tuning myosin contractility and actin polymerization rate allows control over the size and shape of actomyosin gels. Our findings provide a bottom-up framework for integrating molecular motors and cytoskeletons into confined architectures to create responsive biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Weakly Supervised Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Moreover, we demonstrate improved robustness during MD simulations of the MLIP models trained with the proposed weakly supervised loss. Finally, our approach improves the fine-tuning of foundation models on sparse, highly accurate ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time statistics for time-dependent particle injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common scenario in a variety of biological systems is that multiple particles are searching in parallel for an immobile target located in a bounded domain, and the fastest among them that arrives to the target first triggers a given desirable or detrimental process. The statistics of such extreme events -- the \textit{fastest\/} first-passage to the target -- is well-understood by now through a series of theoretical analyses, but exclusively under the assumption that all $N$ particles start \textit{simultaneously\/}, i.e., all are introduced into the domain instantly, by $\delta$-function-like pulses. However, in many practically important situations this is not the case: in order to start their search, the particles often have to enter first into a bounded domain, e.g., a cell or its nucleus, penetrating through gated channels or nuclear pores. This entrance process has a random duration so that the particles appear in the domain sequentially and with a time delay. Here we focus on the effect of such an extended-in-time injection of multiple particles on the fastest first-passage time (fFPT) and its statistics. We derive the full probability density function $H_N(t)$ of the fFPT with an arbitrary time-dependent injection intensity of $N$ particles. Under rather general assumptions on the survival probability of a single particle and on the injection intensity, we derive the large-$N$ asymptotic formula for the mean fFPT, which is quite different from that obtained for the instantaneous $\delta$-pulse injection. The extended injection is also shown to considerably slow down the convergence of $H_N(t)$ to the large-$N$ limit -- the Gumbel distribution -- so that the latter may be inapplicable in the most relevant settings with few tens to few thousands of particles.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe, valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by velocity-dependent friction and noise. In addition to a standard passive regime, we identify peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. These features are quantitatively confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. Our findings reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Cerebral blood flow monitoring using a deep learning implementation of the two-layer DCS analytical model with a 512x512 SPAD array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) analyzes the autocorrelation function of photons scattered by red blood cells, enabling non-invasive, continuous measurement of deep tissue blood flow at the bedside. Multi-layer DCS models (two- and three-layer) enhance cerebral blood flow index (CBFi) sensitivity and mitigate interference from extracerebral tissues. However, these models require multiple predefined parameters and are computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time bedside monitoring. To address this challenge, we integrate a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array with a deep learning (DL)-based approach trained on data generated by the two-layer analytical model. This method bypasses traditional model fitting, enabling real-time CBFi monitoring while minimizing superficial tissue contamination. We first validate our approach using Monte Carlo-simulated test datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in relative CBFi estimation (5.8% error vs. 19.1% for conventional fitting) and enhanced CBFi sensitivity (87.1% vs. 55.4%). Additionally, our method effectively isolates shallow blood flow changes and 750-fold faster than single-exponential fitting in a realistic scenario. We further evaluate the system in a healthy adult, achieving real-time CBFi monitoring and pulsatile waveform recovery during a brain activity test using a 512 512 SPAD array sensor. These results highlight the potential of our approach for real-time brain activity monitoring.</description>
