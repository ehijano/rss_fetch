      <title>Generating Minimum Free Energy Paths With Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method combining denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) with the string method is presented to generate minimum free energy paths between metastable states in molecular systems. It has been demonstrated in recent work that DDPMs at low noise levels can approximate the gradient of the potential of mean force, allowing efficient sampling of high-dimensional configurational spaces. Building on this insight, it is shown here that DDPM-derived force fields accurately generate transition pathways for the analytical Muller-Brown potential and for the alanine dipeptide system at some range of noise levels for DDPMs, recovering the transition path and implicitly capturing solvent effects in the case of alanine dipeptide.</description>

      <title>Double Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Approach with Full Inclusion of 4-Hole-2-Particle Excitations and Three-Body Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) method with a full treatment of 4-hole-2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) correlations and triply excited clusters, abbreviated as DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), and its approximate form called DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) have been formulated and implemented in the open-source CCpy package available on GitHub. The resulting codes work with both nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic Hamiltonians. By examining the DIPs of Cl$_{2}$, Br$_{2}$, and HBr, for which accurate experimental data are available, we demonstrate that the DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approaches improve the results obtained using the DIP-EOMCC methods truncated at 3$h$-1$p$ or 4$h$-2$p$ excitations on top of the CC calculations with singles and doubles.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Aided Multi-Objective Optimization and Multi-Criteria Decision Making in Thermal Cracking Process for Olefines Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Multilayer perceptron (MLP) aided multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) is employed in the present article to optimize the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) thermal cracking process. This new approach significantly accelerated the multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can now be completed within one minute compared to the average of two days required by the conventional approach. Methods: MOO generates a set of equally good Pareto-optimal solutions, which are then ranked using a combination of a weighting method and five multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. The final selection of a single solution for implementation is based on majority voting and the similarity of the recommended solutions from the MCDM methods. Significant Findings: The deep learning (DL) aided MOO and MCDM approach provides valuable insights into the trade-offs between conflicting objectives and a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between them. Furthermore, this approach also allows for a deeper understanding of the impact of decision variables on the objectives, enabling practitioners to make more informed, data-driven decisions in the thermal cracking process.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic forces from reactive molecular orbitals driving chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study offers a physics-based framework for understanding chemical reactions, unveiling the pivotal role of the occupied reactive orbital (ORO), the most stabilized occupied molecular orbital during a reaction, in driving atomic nuclei along the reaction pathway via electrostatic forces. We show that these electrostatic forces are governed by the negative gradient of orbital energy, establishing a direct link between molecular orbital energy variations and nuclear motion. The forces generated by OROs, termed reactive-orbital-based electrostatic forces (ROEFs), were systematically analyzed across 48 representative reactions. Our findings reveal that reactions can be classified into four distinct types, with two dominant types emerging: those that maintain reaction-direction ROEFs either from the early stages or immediately preceding the transition state. These ROEFs carve distinct grooves along the intrinsic reaction coordinates on the potential energy surface, shaping the reaction pathway. Notably, ORO variations align directly with the curly arrow diagrams widely employed in organic chemistry, bridging the curly arrow-like representation of electron transfer with the rigorous potential energy surface framework. This connection highlights the integration of electronic and nuclear motion theories, offering a unified perspective on the forces that drive chemical transformations. By linking orbital energy variations to nuclear motions, this study establishes a robust framework for understanding the interplay between electronic structure and reaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning to Overcome Limitations in Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) offers outstanding potential for molecular characterization and drug discovery, particularly in solving complex properties like the Ground State Energy (GSE) of biomolecules. However, QC faces challenges due to computational noise, scalability, and system complexity. This work presents a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) techniques with quantum algorithms$-$Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Hartree-Fock (HF), and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)$-$to improve GSE predictions for large molecules. Three datasets (chemical descriptors, Coulomb matrices, and a hybrid combination) were prepared using molecular features from PubChem. These datasets trained XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and LightGBM (LGBM) models. XGB achieved the lowest Relative Error (RE) of $4.41 \pm 11.18\%$ on chemical descriptors, outperforming RF ($5.56 \pm 11.66\%$) and LGBM ($5.32 \pm 12.87\%$). HF delivered exceptional precision for small molecules ($0.44 \pm 0.66\% RE$), while a near-linear correlation between GSE and molecular electron count provided predictive shortcuts. This study demonstrates that integrating QC and ML enhances scalability for molecular energy predictions and lays the foundation for scaling QC molecular simulations to larger systems.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the forces: assessing non-conservative force models for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to estimate the energy of a group of atoms, and the forces that drive them to more stable configurations, have revolutionized the fields of computational chemistry and materials discovery. In this domain, rigorous enforcement of symmetry and conservation laws has traditionally been considered essential. For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed as the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation. Several recent works have questioned this physically-constrained approach, suggesting that using the forces as explicit learning targets yields a better trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency - and that energy conservation can be learned during training. The present work investigates the applicability of such non-conservative models in microscopic simulations. We identify and demonstrate several fundamental issues, from ill-defined convergence of geometry optimization to instability in various types of molecular dynamics. Contrary to the case of rotational symmetry, lack of energy conservation is hard to learn, control, and correct. The best approach to exploit the acceleration afforded by direct force evaluation might be to use it in tandem with a conservative model, reducing - rather than eliminating - the additional cost of backpropagation, but avoiding most of the pathological behavior associated with non-conservative forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure determination is essential to a mechanistic understanding of diseases and the development of novel therapeutics. Machine-learning-based structure prediction methods have made significant advancements by computationally predicting protein and bioassembly structures from sequences and molecular topology alone. Despite substantial progress in the field, challenges remain to deliver structure prediction models to real-world drug discovery. Here, we present NeuralPLexer3 -- a physics-inspired flow-based generative model that achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on key biomolecular interaction types and improves training and sampling efficiency compared to its predecessors and alternative methodologies. Examined through newly developed benchmarking strategies, NeuralPLexer3 excels in vital areas that are crucial to structure-based drug design, such as physical validity and ligand-induced conformational changes.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Networks: A Lattice System Analysis Model Based on Structural Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the intricate interactions between particles within a system is a key approach to revealing the essential characteristics of the system, whether it is an in-depth analysis of molecular properties in the field of chemistry or the design of new materials for specific performance requirements in materials science. To this end, we propose Graph Attention Hamiltonian Neural Network (GAHN), a neural network method that can understand the underlying structure of lattice Hamiltonian systems solely through the dynamic trajectories of particles. We can determine which particles in the system interact with each other, the proportion of interactions between different particles, and whether the potential energy of interactions between particles exhibits even symmetry or not. The obtained structure helps the neural network model to continue predicting the trajectory of the system and further understand the dynamic properties of the system. In addition to understanding the underlying structure of the system, it can be used for detecting lattice structural abnormalities, such as link defects, abnormal interactions, etc. These insights benefit system optimization, design, and detection of aging or damage. Moreover, this approach can integrate other components to deduce the link structure needed for specific parts, showcasing its scalability and potential. We tested it on a challenging molecular dynamics dataset, and the results proved its ability to accurately infer molecular bond connectivity, highlighting its scientific research potential.</description>

Abstract: Development of experimental techniques at nanoscale resulted in ability to perform spectroscopic measurements on single-molecule current carrying junctions. These experiments are natural meeting point for research fields of optical spectroscopy and molecular electronics. We present a pedagogical comparison between perturbation theory expansion of standard nonlinear optical spectroscopy and (non-self-consistent) perturbative diagrammatic formulation of the nonequilibrium Green's functions method (NEGF is widely used in molecular electronics) indicating their similarities and differences. Comparing the two approaches we argue that optical spectroscopy of open quantum systems has to be analyzed within the more general Green's function formulation.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional spectroscopy is discussed for open quantum systems with multiple simultaneously measurable fluxes. In particular, we discuss a junction where optical measurements of photon flux are complemented with simultaneous transport measurements of electron currents. Theory of two-dimensional spectroscopy in both fluxes is developed employing non-self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function formulation. Theoretical derivations are illustrated with numerical simulations within generic junction model.</description>

      <title>EquiFlow: Equivariant Conditional Flow Matching with Optimal Transport for 3D Molecular Conformation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular 3D conformations play a key role in determining how molecules interact with other molecules or protein surfaces. Recent deep learning advancements have improved conformation prediction, but slow training speeds and difficulties in utilizing high-degree features limit performance. We propose EquiFlow, an equivariant conditional flow matching model with optimal transport. EquiFlow uniquely applies conditional flow matching in molecular 3D conformation prediction, leveraging simulation-free training to address slow training speeds. It uses a modified Equiformer model to encode Cartesian molecular conformations along with their atomic and bond properties into higher-degree embeddings. Additionally, EquiFlow employs an ODE solver, providing faster inference speeds compared to diffusion models with SDEs. Experiments on the QM9 dataset show that EquiFlow predicts small molecule conformations more accurately than current state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamic Evolution of Interfaces between Polymer Solutions and Gels and Polymer Interdiffusion: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Letting free polymers diffuse from solution into a crosslinked polymer gel is often a crucial processing step in the synthesis of multiphase polymer-based gels, e.g., core-shell microgels. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to obtain molecular insights into this process. We consider idealized situations where the gel is modeled as a regular polymer network with the topology of a diamond lattice, and all free polymers and strands have the same length and consist of the same type of monomer. After bringing the gel and the polymer solution into contact, two time regimes are observed: An initial compression of the gel caused by the osmotic pressure of the solution, followed by an expansion due to swelling. We characterize the time evolution of density profiles, the penetration of free polymers into the gel and the connection between the gel and solution phase. The interfacial structure locally equilibrates after roughly 100 chain relaxation times. At late times, the free chains inside the gel undergo a percolation transition if the polymer concentration in the gel exceeds a critical value, which is of the same order as the overlap concentration. The fluctuations of the interface can be described by a capillary wave model that accounts for the elasticity of the gel. Based on this, we extract the interfacial tension of the gel-solution interface. Interestingly, both the interfacial tension and the local interfacial width increase with increasing free polymer concentration - in contrast to liquid-liquid interfaces, where these two quantities are typically anticorrelated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space, namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for ${de~novo}$ drug design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper, we show that Bayesian flow network is capable of effortlessly generating high quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. We introduce a semi-autoregressive training/sampling method that helps to enhance the model performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Specific Heat Anomalies and Local Symmetry Breaking in (Anti-)Fluorite Materials: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the high-temperature properties of materials with (anti-)fluorite structures is crucial for their application in nuclear reactors. In this study, we employ machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations to investigate the high-temperature thermal properties of thorium dioxide, which has a fluorite structure, and lithium oxide, which has an anti-fluorite structure. Our results show that MLMD simulations effectively reproduce the reported thermal properties of these materials. A central focus of this work is the analysis of specific heat anomalies in these materials at high temperatures, commonly referred to as Bredig, pre-melting, or $\lambda$-transitions. We demonstrate that a local order parameter, analogous to those used to describe liquid-liquid transitions in supercooled water and liquid silica, can effectively characterize these specific heat anomalies. The local order parameter identifies two distinct types of defective structures: lattice defect-like and liquid-like local structures. Above the transition temperature, liquid-like local structures predominate, and the sub-lattice character of mobile atoms disappears.</description>

      <title>A Route Toward the On-Surface Synthesis of Organic Ferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains</title>

Abstract: Engineering sublattice imbalance is an intuitive way to induce high-spin ground states in bipartite polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons (PCHs). Such high-spin molecules can be employed as building blocks of quantum spin chains, which are outstanding platforms to study many-body physics and fundamental models in quantum magnetism. Recent reports on the bottom-up synthesis of antiferromagnetic molecular spin chains provided insights into paradigmatic quantum phenomena such as fractionalization. In contrast to antiferromagnetism, demonstration of ferromagnetic coupling between PCHs has been scarce. Previous attempts in this direction were limited by the formation of non-benzenoid rings leading to spin quenching, or the use of spacer motifs that considerably weaken the magnitude of ferromagnetic exchange. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of short ferromagnetic spin chains based on dibenzotriangulene (DBT), a PCH with a triplet ground state. Our synthetic strategy centers on achieving a direct (that is, without a spacer motif) majority-minority sublattice coupling between adjacent units. This leads to a global sublattice imbalance in spin chains scaling with the chain length, and therefore a ferromagnetic ground state with a strong intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange. By means of scanning probe measurements and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations, we analyze the electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic dimers and trimers of DBT, and confirm their quintet and septet ground states, respectively, with an intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange of 7 meV. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of sublattice coupling on magnetism through complementary experiments on antiferromagnetic DBT dimers with majority-majority and minority-minority couplings. We expect our proof-of-principle study to provide impetus for the design of purely organic ferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Single vibronic level fluorescence spectra from Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence experiments, the electronically excited initial state is also excited in one or several vibrational modes. Whereas computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors individually becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we use Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. In systems where the potential is at most quadratic, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and can be propagated with the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. We validate the method in two-dimensional global harmonic models by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations. Additionally, we study the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the Hagedorn approach to high-dimensional systems on an example of displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>ArcaNN: automated enhanced sampling generation of training sets for chemically reactive machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

Abstract: The emergence of artificial intelligence has profoundly impacted computational chemistry, particularly through machine-learned potentials (MLPs), which offer a balance of accuracy and efficiency in calculating atomic energies and forces to be used in molecular dynamics simulations. These MLPs have significantly advanced molecular dynamics simulations across various applications, including large-scale simulations of materials, interfaces, and chemical reactions. Despite these advances, the construction of training datasets - a critical component for the accuracy of MLPs - has not received proportional attention. This is particularly critical for chemical reactivity which depends on rare barrier-crossing events. Here we address this gap by introducing ArcaNN, a comprehensive framework designed for generating training datasets for reactive MLPs. ArcaNN employs a concurrent learning approach combined with advanced sampling techniques to ensure accurate representation of high-energy geometries. The framework integrates automated processes for iterative training, exploration, new configuration selection, and energy and force labeling, while ensuring reproducibility and documentation. We demonstrate ArcaNN's capabilities through a paradigm nucleophilic substitution reaction in solution, showcasing its effectiveness, the uniformly low error of the resulting MLP everywhere along the chemical reaction coordinate, and its potential for broad applications in reactive molecular dynamics. We also provide guidelines on how to assess the quality of a NNP for a reactive system.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Ab Initio Hagedorn Wavepacket Dynamics: Single Vibronic Level Fluorescence Spectra of Difluorocarbene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepackets have been used to compute single vibronic level (SVL) spectra efficiently in model harmonic potentials. To make the Hagedorn approach practical for realistic polyatomic molecules with anharmonicity, here we combine local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics with on-the-fly ab initio dynamics. We then test this method by computing the SVL fluorescence spectra of difluorocarbene, a small, floppy molecule with a very anharmonic potential energy surface. Our time-dependent approach obtains the emission spectra of all initial vibrational levels from a single anharmonic semiclassical wavepacket trajectory without the need to fit individual anharmonic vibrational wavefunctions and to calculate the Franck-Condon factors for all vibronic transitions. We show that, whereas global harmonic models are inadequate for CF2, the spectra computed with the on-the-fly local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics agree well with experimental data, especially for low initial excitations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamic bounds on logical circuit operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a thermodynamically consistent, mesoscopic model for modern complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, we study an array of logical circuits and explore how their function is constrained by recent thermodynamic uncertainty relations when operating near thermal energies. For a single NOT gate, we find operating direction-dependent dynamics, and a trade-off between dissipated heat and operation time certainty. For a memory storage device, we find an exponential relationship between the memory retention time and energy required to sustain that memory state. For a clock, we find that the certainty in the cycle time is maximized at biasing voltages near thermal energy, as is the trade-off between this certainty and the heat dissipated per cycle. We identify a control mechanism that can increase the cycle time certainty without an offsetting increase in heat dissipation by working at a resonance condition for the clock. These results provide a framework for assessing thermodynamic costs of realistic computing devices, allowing for circuits to be designed and controlled for thermodynamically optimal operation.</description>

      <title>TransPeakNet: Solvent-Aware 2D NMR Prediction via Multi-Task Pre-Training and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for revealing molecular structure, electronic environment, and dynamics. Accurate NMR shift prediction allows researchers to validate structures by comparing predicted and observed shifts. While Machine Learning (ML) has improved one-dimensional (1D) NMR shift prediction, predicting 2D NMR remains challenging due to limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce an unsupervised training framework for predicting cross-peaks in 2D NMR, specifically Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC).Our approach pretrains an ML model on an annotated 1D dataset of 1H and 13C shifts, then finetunes it in an unsupervised manner using unlabeled HSQC data, which simultaneously generates cross-peak annotations. Our model also adjusts for solvent effects. Evaluation on 479 expert-annotated HSQC spectra demonstrates our model's superiority over traditional methods (ChemDraw and Mestrenova), achieving Mean Absolute Errors (MAEs) of 2.05 ppm and 0.165 ppm for 13C shifts and 1H shifts respectively. Our algorithmic annotations show a 95.21% concordance with experts' assignments, underscoring the approach's potential for structural elucidation in fields like organic chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and natural products.</description>

      <title>Automated Molecular Concept Generation and Labeling with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with explainable AI methods like concept-based models (CMs) showing promise for new discoveries. However, in molecular science, CMs are less common than black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), due to their need for predefined concepts and manual labeling. This paper introduces the Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and label predictive molecular concepts. Through iterative concept refinement, AutoMolCo enables simple linear models to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The framework operates without human knowledge input, overcoming limitations of existing CMs while maintaining explainability and allowing easy intervention. Experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets demonstrate that AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial for molecular science research.</description>

      <title>Local fermion-to-qudit mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new set of local fermion-to-qudit mappings for simulating fermionic lattice systems. We focus on the use of multi-level qudits, specifically ququarts. Traditional mappings, such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JWT), while useful, often result in non-local operators that scale unfavorably with system size. To address these challenges, we introduce mappings that efficiently localize fermionic operators on qudits, reducing the non-locality and operator weights associated with JWT. We propose one mapping for spinless fermions and two mappings for spinful fermions, comparing their performance in terms of qudit-weight, circuit depth, and gate complexity. By leveraging the extended local Hilbert space of qudits, we show that these mappings enable more efficient quantum simulations in terms of two-qudit gates, reducing hardware requirements without increasing computational complexity. We validate our approach by simulating prototypical models such as the spinless t-V model and the Fermi-Hubbard model in two dimensions, using Trotterized time evolution. Our results highlight the potential of qudit-based quantum simulations in achieving scalability and efficiency for fermionic systems on near-term quantum devices.</description>
