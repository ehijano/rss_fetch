      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</description>

      <title>The Role of Dark States on Azopyrrole Photoisomerization Reaction by Varying the Coupling Strength of Light-Matter Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions are gaining importance in controlling the photoswitching behavior of molecules exhibiting bistability. Here, we used the strategy of electronic strong coupling of both the E and Z-isomers of azopyrrole photoswitches to a single cavity mode, thereby tuning the conditions from strong to weak coupling in an on-the-go photoisomerization process. This allows in situ monitoring of apparent rates of forward and backward reactions. Very interestingly, the kinetics follow a non-linear trend with a sharp switch in the kinetic slope at the intermediate coupling regime. At this condition, pumping at the upper polaritonic state and the uncoupled population shows an acceleration of the photoisomerization process mediated by the dark state manifold. On the other hand, an opposite effect is observed while exciting the lower polaritonic state. Performing the same experiment in the ultra-strong coupling regime shows no dynamic change over time but further emphasizes the outstanding role of the lower polaritonic states. Our experimental and theoretical findings underline the importance of collective strong coupling in tailoring energy transfer to control photoisomerization dynamically.</description>

      <title>Spin-Generator Coordinate Method for Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new application of the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) as an electronic structure method for strong electron correlation in molecular systems. We identify spin fluctuations as an important generator coordinate responsible for strong static electron correlation that is associated with bond-breaking processes. Spin-constrained Unrestricted HF (c-UHF) states are used to define a manifold of basis states for the Hill-Wheeler equations, which are discretized and solved as a non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) expansion. The method was tested on two-electron systems that are dominated by static and-or dynamic correlations. In a minimal basis set for H2, the resulting GCM quickly captures the ground-state full configuration interaction energy with just a few c-UHF states, whereas second-order perturbation theory on top of the GCM is needed to recover over 90% of the correlation energy in the cc-pVDZ basis set.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium origin of cavity-induced resonant modifications of chemical reactivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of light-matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that in both scenarios, the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned in resonance with the relevant vibrational transition, which directly leads to the formation of the corresponding product. In addition, due to the anharmonicity of chemical reactions, cavity-induced vibrational transitions within the reactant region can also influence reaction rates even when they do not directly result in product formation. However, we found that the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our proof-of-concept study highlights that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chemistry Driven Molecular Inverse Design with Data-free Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse design of molecules has challenged chemists for decades. In the past years, machine learning and artificial intelligence have emerged as new tools to generate molecules tailoring desired properties, but with the limit of relying on models that are pretrained on large datasets. Here, we present a data-free generative model based on reinforcement learning and quantum mechanics calculations. To improve the generation, our software is based on a five-model reinforcement learning algorithm designed to mimic the syntactic rules of an original ASCII encoding based on the SMILES one, and here reported. The reinforcement learning generator is rewarded by on-the-fly quantum mechanics calculations within a computational routine addressing conformational sampling. We demonstrate that our software successfully generates new molecules with desired properties finding optimal solutions for problems with known solutions and (sub)optimal molecules for unexplored chemical (sub)spaces, jointly showing significant speed-up to a reference baseline.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Understanding of Vibrational Energy Transfer in Molecule-Surface Scattering: Both Adiabatic and Nonadiabatic Channels Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy transfer during molecular collisions on metal surfaces plays a pivotal role in a host of critical interfacial processes. Despite significant efforts, our understanding of relevant energy transfer mechanisms, even in an extensively-studied benchmark like NO scattering from Au(111), remains far from complete. To fully disentangle different energy transfer channels, we develop a first-principles nonadiabatic dynamical model that incorporates explicitly all degrees of freedom and the interfacial electron transfer. Our simulations reproduce, for the first time, most experimental observations on vibrational relaxation and excitation of NO molecules under varying initial conditions and clearly elaborate the respective adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions. This model identifies the direct adiabatic vibration-to-translation coupling as the dominant role of translation, while excluding significant translation-to-electron nonadiabatic coupling. Furthermore, the observed steric effect varying with the initial vibrational state is understood by the change of orientational dependence of the metal-to-molecule electron transfer. These new insights highlight the importance of treating both adiabatic and nonadiabatic energy transfer pathways on an equal footing, offering significant implications for modeling energy transfer processes in more complex systems, such as plasmonic photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Stability of Geopolymer Activator Solutions for Optimised Synthesis through Thermodynamic Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.</description>

      <title>ILVES: Accurate and efficient bond length and angle constraints in molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics simulations are customarily carried out by constraining internal degrees of freedom. The de facto state-of-the-art algorithms for this purpose, SHAKE, LINCS and P-LINCS, converge slowly, impeding high-accuracy calculations and limiting the realism of simulations. Furthermore, LINCS and P-LINCS cannot handle general angular constraints, which restricts increasing the time step.
  In this paper, we introduce ILVES, a set of parallel algorithms that converge so rapidly that it is now practical to solve bond length and associated angular constraint equations as accurately as the hardware will allow. We have integrated our work into Gromacs and our analysis demonstrates that, in most cases, our software is superior to the state-of-the-art. We anticipate that ILVES will allow for an increase in the time step, thus accelerating contemporary calculations by a factor of at least 2. This will allow the scientific community to increase the range of phenomena that can therefore be simulated.</description>

      <title>Strain Problems got you in a Twist? Try StrainRelief: A Quantum-Accurate Tool for Ligand Strain Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ligand strain energy, the energy difference between the bound and unbound conformations of a ligand, is an important component of structure-based small molecule drug design. A large majority of observed ligands in protein-small molecule co-crystal structures bind in low-strain conformations, making strain energy a useful filter for structure-based drug design. In this work we present a tool for calculating ligand strain with a high accuracy. StrainRelief uses a MACE Neural Network Potential (NNP), trained on a large database of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to estimate ligand strain of neutral molecules with quantum accuracy. We show that this tool estimates strain energy differences relative to DFT to within 1.4 kcal/mol, more accurately than alternative NNPs. These results highlight the utility of NNPs in drug discovery, and provide a useful tool for drug discovery teams.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking semi-empirical quantum chemical methods on liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Bounds on a Wavefunction Overlap with Hamiltonian Eigen-states: Performance Guarantees for the Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the overlap between an approximate wavefunction and a target eigenstate of the system Hamiltonian is essential for the efficiency of quantum phase estimation. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on this overlap using expectation values of Hamiltonian powers and bounds on target eigenenergies. The accuracy of these bounds can be systematically improved by computing higher-order Hamiltonian moments and refining eigenenergy estimates. Our method offers a practical approach to assessing initial state quality and can be implemented on both classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Based Voltage Prediction for Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the voltage of battery materials is essential for advancing energy storage technologies and designing more efficient, high-performance batteries. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the average voltage of materials used in Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from the Materials Project, incorporating a diverse set of features, including structural, physical, chemical, electronic, and thermodynamic properties, along with battery-specific descriptors. These features were utilized to construct a robust DNN model aimed at facilitating the discovery of novel battery materials. The model performance evaluated through 10-fold cross validation achieving an R$^2$ value of 0.99 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.069 V on the validation dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the model's capability to capture the complex relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that machine learning approaches, particularly DNN models, can provide rapid and reliable voltage predictions without relying on computationally expensive first-principles calculations. This research shows how systematic data analysis can accelerate the identification and improvement of next-generation battery materials. By focusing on key material properties and using computational methods, our study lays the groundwork for faster development of new energy storage solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical relations for the glass transition temperature, $T_g$, and the crystal melting temperature, $T_m$, are developed on the basis of nonaffine lattice dynamics. The proposed relations explain: (i) the seemingly universal factor of $\approx 2/3$ difference between glass transition temperature and melting temperature of the corresponding crystal, and (ii) the recent empirical discovery that both $T_g$ and $T_m$ are proportional to the liquid fragility $m$ divided by the thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ of the solid.</description>

      <title>High-frequency tails in spectral densities</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in numerically exact quantum dynamics methods have brought the dream of accurately modeling the dynamics of chemically complex open systems within reach. Path-integral-based methods, hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) and quantum analog simulators all require the spectral density (SD) of the environment to describe its effect on the system. Here we focus on the decoherence dynamics of electronically excited species in solution in the common case where nonradiative electronic relaxation dominates and is much slower than electronic dephasing. We show that the computed relaxation rate is highly sensitive to the choice of SD representation $\unicode{x2013}$ such as the Drude-Lorentz or Brownian modes $\unicode{x2013}$ or strategy used to capture the main SD features, even when early-times dephasing dynamics remains robust. The key reason is that electronic relaxation is dominated by the resonant contribution from the high-frequency tails of the SD, which are orders of magnitude weaker than the main features of the SD and can vary significantly between strategies. This finding highlights an important, yet overlooked, numerical challenge: obtaining an accurate spectral density requires capturing its structure over several orders of magnitude to ensure correct decoherence dynamics at both early and late times. To address this, we provide a simple transformation that recovers the correct relaxation rates in quantum simulations constrained by algorithmic or physical limitations on the shape of the SD. Our findings enable comparison of different numerically exact simulation methods and expand the capabilities of analog simulations of open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Polariton-induced Purcell effects via a reduced semiclassical electrodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell--Schr\"odinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. Additionally, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach -- an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Statistical theory of cumulant mapping in an imperfect apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cumulant mapping has been recently suggested [Frasinski, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 24, 207767 (2022)] as an efficient approach to observing multi-particle fragmentation pathways, while bypassing the restrictions of the usual coincidence-measurement approach. We present a formal analysis of the cumulant-mapping technique in the presence of moderate external noise, which induces spurious correlations between the fragments. Suppression of false-cumulant signal may impose severe restrictions on the stability of the experimental setup and/or the permissible average event rate, which increase with the cumulant order. We demonstrate that cumulant mapping in an imperfect apparatus remains competitive for dominant processes and for pathways with a background-free marker fragment. We further show that the false-cumulant contributions increase faster than linearly with the average event rate, providing a simple test for the experimental data analysis.</description>

      <title>The Q-AMOEBA (CF) Polarizable Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Q-AMOEBA (CF), an enhanced version of the Q-AMOEBA polarizable model that integrates a geometry-dependent charge flux (CF) term while designed for an explicit treatment of nuclear quantum effects (NQE). The inclusion of CF effects allows matching experimental data for the molecular structure of water in both gas and liquid phases, addressing limitations faced by most force fields. We show that Q-AMOEBA (CF) provides highly accurate results for a wide range of thermodynamical properties of liquid water. Using the computational efficiency of the adaptive Quantum Thermal Bath method, which accounts for NQE at a cost comparable to classical molecular dynamics, we evaluate the robustness and transferability of Q-AMOEBA (CF) by calculating hydration free energies of various ions and organic molecules. Finally, we apply this methodology to the alanine dipeptide and compute the corresponding dihedral angle potential of mean force and hydration free energy. Unexpectedly, the latter quantity displays significant NQE. These results pave the way to a finer understanding of their role in biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Analog Quantum Simulation of Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics in Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. We present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling and Analysis of Transport Phenomena for Continuous Lyophilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) is a typical process in pharmaceutical manufacturing used for improving the stability of various drug products, including its recent applications to mRNA vaccines. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shifting the pharmaceutical industry toward continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which comprehensively incorporates and describes key transport phenomena in all three steps of lyophilization, namely freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The proposed model considers the state-of-the-art lyophilization technology, in which vials are suspended and move continuously through the process. The validated model can accurately predict the evolution of critical process parameters, including the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire process. Several applications related to model-based process design and optimization of continuous lyophilization are also demonstrated. The final model is made available in MATLAB and Julia as an open-source software package called ContLyo, which can ultimately be leveraged for guiding the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Resetting for Informed Search Strategies and the Design of Non-equilibrium Steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting, the procedure of stopping and re-initializing random processes, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating processes ranging from queuing systems to molecular simulations. However, its usefulness is severely limited by assuming that the resetting protocol is completely decoupled from the state and age of the process that is being reset. We present a general formulation for state- and time-dependent resetting of stochastic processes, which we call adaptive resetting. This allows us to predict, using a single set of trajectories without resetting and via a simple reweighing procedure, all key observables of processes with adaptive resetting. These include the first-passage time distribution, the propagator, and the steady-state. Our formulation enables efficient exploration of informed search strategies and facilitates the prediction and design of complex non-equilibrium steady states, eliminating the need for extensive brute-force sampling across different resetting protocols. Finally, we develop a general machine learning framework to optimize the adaptive resetting protocol for an arbitrary task beyond the current state of the art. We use it to discover efficient protocols for accelerating molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>On the Hidden Transient Interphase in Metal Anodes: Dynamic Precipitation Controls Electrochemical Interfaces in Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, SEI, formed on a battery electrode has been a central area of research for decades. This thin, complex layer profoundly impacts the electrochemical deposition morphology and stability of the metal in battery anodes. Departing from conventional approaches, we investigate metal dissolution, the reverse reaction of deposition, in battery environments using a state-of-the-art electroanalytical system combining a rotating-disk electrode and in-operando visualization. Our key finding is the presence of a Transient Solid-Electrolyte Interphase, T-SEI, that forms during fast discharging at high dissolution rates. We attribute T-SEI formation to transient local supersaturation and resultant electrolyte salt deposition. The T-SEI fundamentally alters the dissolution kinetics at the electrochemical interface, leading to a self-limiting morphological evolution and eventually yielding a flat, clean surface. Unlike a classical SEI formed due to electrolyte decomposition, the T-SEI is fully relaxable upon removal of the enforced dissolution current. The formation of T-SEI, surprisingly, plays a critical role in the subsequent electrodeposition. When the metal is redeposited on a fully relaxed T-SEI surface, the morphology is remarkably different from that deposited on pristine or low-rate discharged metal electrodes. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis suggests a homoepitaxial relationship with the original grains in the electrode. This is in stark contrast to the isolated, particulate nuclei seen on standard metal electrodes without T-SEI formation. Our findings provide important insights into the electrochemical kinetics at the metal-electrolyte interface, particularly in concentrated or water-in-salt electrolytes that are close to the salt saturation limit. The results suggest a new dimension for electrochemical engineering in batteries.</description>

      <title>Velocity Jumps for Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Velocity Jumps approach, denoted as JUMP, a new class of Molecular dynamics integrators, replacing the Langevin dynamics by a hybrid model combining a classical Langevin diffusion and a piecewise deterministic Markov process, where the expensive computation of long-range pairwise interactions is replaced by a resampling of the velocities at random times. This framework allows for an acceleration in the simulation speed while preserving sampling and dynamical properties such as the diffusion constant. It can also be integrated in classical multi-timestep methods, pushing further the computational speedup, while avoiding some of the resonance issues of the latter thanks to the random nature of jumps. The JUMP, JUMP-RESPA and JUMP-RESPA1 integrators have been implemented in the GPU-accelerated version of the Tinker-HP package and are shown to provide significantly enhanced performances compared to their BAOAB, BAOAB-RESPA and BAOAB-RESPA1 counterparts respectively.</description>
