      <title>On the squares functor and the Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal work of Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum on derived algebraic geometry, eight conjectures regarding the theory of $(\infty,2)$-categories are stated. This paper aims to clarify the status of these claims, and to provide a proof for the last remaining open one. Along the way, we demonstrate the universal property of the so-called squares functor, a construction that plays an important role in the $(\infty,2)$-categorical foundations of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum.</description>

      <title>Cauchy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper where he defined the Cauchy completion of a $\mathscr{V}$-category, Lawvere also defined a condition on a $\mathscr{V}$-functor which made it analogous to a map of metric spaces whose image is topologically dense in its codomain. We call this condition Cauchy density. In this note, we focus on the fully faithful Cauchy dense $\mathscr{V}$-functors, and show that the Cauchy completion of $\mathscr{A}$ is the largest $\mathscr{V}$-category that admits a fully faithful Cauchy dense $\mathscr{V}$-functor from $\mathscr{A}$. Moreover, we show that $F \colon \mathscr{A} \to \mathscr{B}$ is fully faithful and Cauchy dense iff $[F,\mathscr{C}] \colon [\mathscr{B},\mathscr{C}] \to [\mathscr{A},\mathscr{C}]$ is an equivalence for any Cauchy complete $\mathscr{C}$. Finally, we provide examples and characterisations of Cauchy dense functors in various contexts.</description>

      <title>Generalised ultracategories and conceptual completeness of geometric logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of generalised ultracategories, these are relational extensions to ultracategories as defined by Lurie. An essential example of generalised ultracategories are topological spaces, and these play a fundamental role in the theory of generalised ultracategories. Another example of these generalised ultracategories is points of toposes. In this paper, we show a conceptual completeness theorem for toposes with enough points, stating that any such topos can be reconstructed from its generalised ultracategory of points. This is done by considering left ultrafunctors from topological spaces to the category of points and paralleling this construction with another known fundamental result in topos theory, namely that any topos with enough points is a colimit of a topological groupoid.</description>

      <title>A 2-categorical approach to the semantics of dependent type theory with computation axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axiomatic type theory is a dependent type theory without computation rules. The term equality judgements that usually characterise these rules are replaced by computation axioms, i.e., additional term judgements that are typed by identity types. This paper is devoted to providing an effective description of its semantics, from a higher categorical perspective: given the challenge of encoding intensional type formers into 1-dimensional categorical terms and properties, a challenge that persists even for axiomatic type formers, we adopt Richard Garner's approach in the 2-dimensional study of dependent types. We prove that the type formers of axiomatic theories can be encoded into natural 2-dimensional category theoretic data, obtaining a presentation of the semantics of axiomatic type theory via 2-categorical models called display map 2-categories. In the axiomatic case, the 2-categorical requirements identified by Garner for interpreting intensional type formers are relaxed. Therefore, we obtain a presentation of the semantics of the axiomatic theory that generalises Garner's one for the intensional case. Our main result states that the interpretation of axiomatic theories within display map 2-categories is well-defined and enjoys the soundness property. We use this fact to provide a semantic proof that the computation rule of intensional identity types is not admissible in axiomatic type theory. This is achieved via a revisitation of Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model that believes axiomatic identity types but does not believe intensional ones.</description>

      <title>On some integral properties of dimensions in Isaacs fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a fusion category, we prove some new integral properties concerning the dimension of a simple object that generates a Isaacs fusion subcategory. A stronger divisibility result is proven for any modular fusion category. This divisibility result implies the converse direction of a Ito-Michler type result for modular fusion categories, recently established by the author.</description>

      <title>On the lack of colimits in various categories of BAOs and Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that various categories of BAOs (boolean algebras with an operator) with stable morphisms between them are not cocomplete, and that neither are the category of Heyting algebras with bounded lattice morphisms, its full subcategory consisting of frames, and the category of frames with Heyting morphisms. As a consequence, none of these categories is equivalent to a prevariety of algebras, let alone a variety. In particular, we obtain that the category of McKinsey-Tarski algebras is not equivalent to a variety, thus answering a question by Peter Jipsen in the negative.</description>

      <title>Lifting of locally initial objects and universal (co)acting Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal (co)acting bi/Hopf algebras introduced by Yu. I. Manin, M. Sweedler and D. Tambara, the universal Hopf algebra of a given (co)module structure, as well as the universal group of a grading, introduced by J. Patera and H. Zassenhaus, find their applications in the classification of quantum symmetries. Typically, universal (co)acting objects are defined as initial or terminal in the corresponding categories and, as such, they do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, we introduce the support of a given object, which generalizes the support of a grading and is used to restrict the class of objects under consideration. The existence problems for universal objects are formulated and studied in a purely categorical manner by seeing them as particular cases of the lifting problem for a locally initial object. We prove the existence of a lifting and, consequently, of the universal (co)acting objects under some assumptions on the base (braided or symmetric monoidal) category. In contrast to existing constructions, our approach is self-dual in the sense that we can use the same proof to obtain the existence of universal actions and coactions. In particular, when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field, the category of sets or their duals, we recover known existence results for the aforementioned universal objects. The proposed approach allows us to apply our results not only to the classical categories of sets and vectors spaces and their duals but also to (co)modules over bi/Hopf algebras, differential graded vector spaces, $G$-sets and graded sets.</description>

      <title>Dualities for universal (co)acting Hopf monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids, which prove to be a useful tool in the classification of quantum symmetries, do not always exist. In order to ensure their existence, the support of a given object was recently introduced in \cite{AGV3} and used to restrict the class of objects considered when defining universal (co)acting objects. It is well-known that, in contrast with the universal coacting Hopf algebra, for actions on algebras over a field it is usually difficult to describe the universal acting Hopf algebra explicitly and this turns the duality theorem into an important investigation tool. In the present paper we establish duality results for universal (co)measuring (co)monoids and universal (co)acting bi/Hopf monoids in pre-rigid braided monoidal categories $\mathcal{C}$. In addition, when the base category $\mathcal{C}$ is closed monoidal, we provide a convenient uniform approach to the aforementioned universal objects in terms of the cosupports, which in this case become subobjects of internal hom-objects. In order to explain our constructions, we use the language of locally initial objects. Known results from the literature are recovered when the base category is the category of vector spaces over a field. New cases where our results can be applied are explored, including categories of (co)modules over (co)quasitriangular Hopf algebras, Yetter-Drinfeld modules and dg-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monads and Biproducts: A Uniform Interpretation of Parallelism in Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to modelling parallelism and algebraic structure in lambda calculi often rely on monads -- as in Moggi's framework -- or on rich categorical structures such as biproducts -- as used in linear logic. In this work, we propose a minimal alternative that captures both parallelism and weighted parallelism (linear combinations) within the setting of intuitionistic propositional logic, without resorting to monads or assuming the existence of biproducts.
  We introduce two lambda calculi: a parallel lambda calculus and an algebraic lambda calculus, both extending full propositional intuitionistic logic. Their semantics are given in two categories: ${\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are magmas and arrows are functions in $\mathbf{Set}$; and ${\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are action magmas.
  The key technical challenge addressed is the interpretation of disjunction in the presence of parallel and algebraic operators. Since the usual coproduct structure is unavailable in our minimal setting, we propose a novel set-theoretic interpretation based on the union of the disjoint union and the Cartesian product. This allows for the construction of sound and adequate models for both calculi.
  Our results offer a unified and structurally lightweight framework for modelling parallelism and algebraic effects in intuitionistic logic, opening the way to alternatives beyond the traditional monadic or linear logic approaches.</description>
