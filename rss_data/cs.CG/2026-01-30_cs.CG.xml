      <title>On the stability, complexity, and distribution of similarity classes of the longest edge bisection process for triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Longest Edge Bisection of a triangle is performed by joining the midpoint of its longest edge to the opposite vertex. Applying this procedure iteratively produces an infinite family of triangles. Surprisingly, a classical result of Stynes (1980) shows that for any initial triangle, this infinite family falls into finitely many similarity classes.
  While the set of classes is finite, it turns out that a far smaller, stable subset of ``fat'' triangles effectively dominates the final mesh structure. We prove the following asymptotic area distribution result: for every initial triangle, the portion of area occupied by terminal quadruples tends to one, with the convergence occurring at an exponential rate. In fact, we provide the precise distribution of triangles in every step. We introduce the {\bf bisection graph} and use spectral methods to establish this result.
  Given this dominance, we provide a complete characterization of triangles possessing a single terminal quadruple, while conversely exhibiting a sequence of triangles with an unbounded number of terminal quadruples. Furthermore, we reveal several fundamental geometric properties of the points of a terminal quadruple, laying the groundwork for studying the geometric distribution of the entire orbit. Our analysis leverages the hyperbolic geometry framework of Perdomo and Plaza (2014) and refines their techniques.</description>

      <title>Convex Hull 3D Filtering with GPU Ray Tracing and Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, applications such as real-time simulations, autonomous systems, and video games increasingly demand the processing of complex geometric models under stringent time constraints. Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to 200x with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage. These results highlight the dual benefit of the method in terms of both speed and energy efficiency, reinforcing its applicability in modern high-performance scenarios.</description>

      <title>A convex polyhedron without Rupert's property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A three-dimensional convex body is said to have Rupert's property if its copy can be passed through a straight hole inside that body. In this work we construct a polyhedron which is provably not Rupert, thus we disprove a conjecture from 2017. We also find a polyhedron that is Rupert but not locally Rupert.</description>
