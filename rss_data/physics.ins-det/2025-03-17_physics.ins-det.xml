      <title>Real-time monitoring of LHCb interaction region with a fast trackless methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing computing power and bandwidth of FPGAs opens new possibilities in the field of real-time processing of high-energy physics data. The LHCb experiment has implemented a cluster-finder FPGA architecture aimed at reconstructing hits in its innermost silicon-pixel detector on-the-fly during readout. In addition to accelerating the event reconstruction procedure by providing it with higher-level primitives, this system enables further opportunities. LHCb triggerless readout architecture makes these reconstructed hit positions available for every collision, amounting to a flow of $10^{11}$ hits per second, that can be used for further analysis. In this work, we have implemented a set of programmable counters, counting the hit rate at many locations in the detector volume simultaneously. We use these data to continuously track the motion of the beams overlap region and the relative position of the detector elements, with precisions of $\mathcal{O}\left(\mu m\right)$ and time granularity of $\mathcal{O}\left(ms\right)$. We show that this can be achieved by simple linear combination of data, that can be executed in real time with minimal computational effort. This novel approach allows a fast and precise determination of the beamline position without the need to reconstruct more complex quantities like tracks and vertices. We report results obtained with $pp$ collision data collected in 2024 at LHCb.</description>

      <title>The concept of a superconducting spin flipper - neutron decelerator for a UCN source at a pulsed reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is devoted to the development of a conceptual design for a gradient spin flipper - neutron decelerator, which is the main component of a designed UCN source for a pulsed reactor. In close cooperation between the JINR group and SuperOx, a preliminary design of a stationary gradient magnet for the adiabatic spin flipper has been developed. A thorough calculation of the magnetic field configuration has been performed. The movement of neutrons in the magnetic field generated by the designed magnetic system has been simulated, and the deceleration time of neutrons in the spin flipper has been analyzed. The results obtained give grounds for hope that the idea of creating a UCN source based on pulsed accumulation in a trap using non-stationary neutron deceleration is feasible.</description>

      <title>Optical design for the single crystal neutron diffractometer Pioneer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pioneer is a single-crystal neutron diffractometer optimized for small-volume samples and weak signals at the Second Target Station (STS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This paper presents the preliminary optical design progress, focusing on the rationale behind key design choices. It covers the T$_0$ and bandwidth disk choppers, guide and beam control system, incident-beam polarizer, scattering beam collimators, and additional strategies. The chopper locations are selected to maximize neutron transport while taking advantage of standardized shielding structures. To accommodate the maintenance shield, operational shutter, and polarizing V-cavity, the guide design includes significant gaps. When these optical components are moved out of the beam path, oversized collimators, rather than guides, will be translated in. Pioneer will utilize slit packages to control beam size and divergence, and a translatable polarizing V-cavity. Absorbing panels are strategically placed near the end station to minimize background. An oscillating radial collimator, operating in a shift mode, will be used with the vertical cylindrical detector, while a fixed multi-cone collimator will be used with the bottom flat detector. These collimators will enable the detection of weak signals when complex sample environments are used.</description>

      <title>Incident beam optics optimization for the single crystal neutron diffractometer Pioneer with a polarized beam option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pioneer, a next-generation single-crystal neutron diffractometer, is under development for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Second Target Station (STS). Designed to address a wide range of scientific questions, Pioneer will deliver homogeneous neutron beams with customizable size and divergence, and provide a polarized beam option. This article introduces its incident beam optics, highlighting the optimization methodology and the simulated performance. Pioneer will utilize a modified elliptical-straight guide for neutron transport and deploy slit packages and insertable apertures to control beam size and divergence. The optimized guide geometry matches the optimal-and-full-sample-illumination condition, and the beam control system effectively filters out unwanted neutrons while preserving the desired ones. Additionally, we have found that polygon-approximated guides provide satisfactory transport efficiency and beam homogeneity, eliminating the need of truly curved guides. To enhance neutronics performance and reduce cost, the coatings of supermirror elements are individually optimized to the lowest half-integer $m$-values that are sufficient to deliver the desired neutrons. After evaluating polarizing V-cavities and $^3$He spin filters over the default polarized wavelength band of 1.2-5.5~\AA, we selected a translatable multichannel polarizing V-cavity as the incident beam polarizer. Strategically placed at a location where the beam divergence is low and a large in-guide gap has negligible impact on transport efficiency, the optimized V-cavity achieves an average $P^2T$ of approximately 35\%.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Heterodyne Microwave Interferometer for Plasma Density Measurements on the Madison AWAKE Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Madison AWAKE Prototype (MAP) is a high-power, high-density helicon plasma experiment. The project's main goal is to develop a scalable plasma source for use in a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator as part of the AWAKE project. We measure the plasma density with a new heterodyne microwave interferometer that features several improvements over traditional approaches. The design uses a single microwave source combined with an upconverter to avoid frequency drift and reduce overall cost. Elliptical mirrors focus the probe beam into the plasma and guide it back to the receiver. The transmitter and receiver along with the measurement electronics are co-located in a small enclosure and are assisted by two small mirrors on the opposite side of MAP. Both halves of the system move independently on computer-controlled motion platforms. This setup enables fast repositioning of the interferometer to measure at any axial location despite the magnets, wiring and structural supports that would block movement of a waveguide-based system. A high-speed, high-precision mixed signal circuit and FPGA analyze the probe signal directly in the enclosure which obviates the need for a digitizer or oscilloscope. The interferometer resolves phase shifts down to one hundredth of a fringe, resulting in a line-averaged resolution of $1.5\mathrm{\cdot 10^{17}\; m^{-3}}$. The system provides a real-time measurement every $5\;\mathrm{\mu s}$ up into the mid $\mathrm{10^{19}\; m^{-3}}$ density range with a noise level of $1.0\mathrm{\cdot 10^{17}\; m^{-3}}$.</description>

      <title>A Packaging Method for ALPIDE Integration Enabling Flexible and Low-Material-Budget Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel solution for the packaging of ALPIDE chips that facilitates non-planar assembly with a minimal material budget. This solution represents a technological advancement based on methodologies developed for the ALICE ITS1 and the STAR tracker two decades ago. The core of this approach involves the use of flexible cables composed of aluminum and polyimide, with thicknesses on the order of tens of micrometers. These cables are connected to the sensors using single-point Tape Automated Bonding (spTAB), which replaces the traditional wire bonding technique that is suboptimal for curved integrations. The spTAB bonding is achieved by creating openings in the polyimide layer, allowing aluminum wires to remain free-standing, which are then connected to the sensor using pressure and ultrasonic energy. Extending this concept, we have applied this approach to entire printed circuit boards (PCBs), resulting in a fully flexible packaging solution maintaining an ultra-low material budget. This work introduces a prototype utilizing this method to bond an ALPIDE chip, proposing it as a viable option for future designs necessitating flexible packaging for both the chip and associated electronics. The overall workflow, comprising microfabrication and assembly, is carried out at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler and INFN TIFPA laboratories and will be detailed to elucidate our procedures and demonstrate the applicability of our solution in future experimental setups. The proposed packaging features a flexible PCB constructed from three stacked layers, each containing 20 $\mu$m thick aluminum features and a 25 $\mu$m thick polyimide substrate. These layers include a ground layer, a signal layer (encompassing both digital and analog signals), and a local bonding layer (which substitutes wire bonding).</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Object Condensation Clustering for Calorimeter Shower Reconstruction at CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several nuclear physics studies using the CLAS12 detector rely on the accurate reconstruction of neutrons and photons from its forward angle calorimeter system. These studies often place restrictive cuts when measuring neutral particles due to an overabundance of false clusters created by the existing calorimeter reconstruction software. In this work, we present a new AI approach to clustering CLAS12 calorimeter hits based on the object condensation framework. The model learns a latent representation of the full detector topology using GravNet layers, serving as the positional encoding for an event's calorimeter hits which are processed by a Transformer encoder. This unique structure allows the model to contextualize local and long range information, improving its performance. Evaluated on one million simulated $e+p$ collision events, our method significantly improves cluster trustworthiness: the fraction of reliable neutron clusters, increasing from 8.98\% to 30.65\%, and photon clusters, increasing from 51.10\% to 63.64\%. Our study also marks the first application of AI clustering techniques for hodoscopic detectors, showing potential for usage in many other experiments.</description>

      <title>LiquidO: Neutrino Detection and Imaging in Opaque Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For several decades now, scintillator detectors have found a wide range of applications in particle physics, including neutrino detection, the search for dark matter and even medical imaging. These detectors so far have strongly relied on the transparency of the scintillating medium, through which light is typically propagated to surrounding photosensors. In this work, we present the results of a 10 litre prototype based on a novel detection approach where an opaque scintillator medium is used to confine light near its creation point that is then collected by a grid of wavelength-shifting fibres traversing the detector. The prototype is operated with different media, including the novel opaque scintillator NoWaSH whose scattering length varies with temperature. Our results progressively demonstrate the temperature-dependent stochastic confinement of the light, with 90% (80%) of the light being confined within a radius of 5 cm (4 cm) when the scattering length is on the order of a few millimetres. The results also demonstrate the pulse shape resolution of our setup capable of resolving Cherenkov and scintillation light. Altogether, the observations match the performance expected for this new type of detector, whose capabilities are expected to include the imaging of particle interactions down to MeV-energies.</description>

      <title>Microfacet projected area-based correction for unified model of Geant4 for rough surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modification of the optical model for rough surfaces, implemented in Geant4 as a part of the unified model, is suggested. The modified model takes into account the variation of the interaction probability of the photon with the microfacet based on the relative orientation of the photon and the sampled microfacet's normal. The implementation is using a rejection algorithm and assumes the interaction probability to be proportional to the projection of the microfacet area on the plane perpendicular to the photon direction. A comparison of the results obtained with the original and the modified models, as well as obtained in direct Monte Carlo simulations are presented for several test surfaces constructed using a pattern of elementary geometrical shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel cooling method that uses the phase separation and evaporative cooling of 3He to reach and continuously maintain sub-kelvin temperatures. While less complex than a dilution refrigerator, the system performs similarly to a continuous 3He cryostat but with a simpler design, a more efficient cooldown process, and a significantly smaller 3He requirement. Our prototype demonstrated a base temperature of 585 mK and 3 mW cooling power at 700 mK using just two gaseous liters of 3He. Lower temperatures could be expected in systems with improved heat exchangers and pumping efficiency.</description>

      <title>Belle II track finding and hit filtering using precise timing information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SuperKEKB accelerator and the Belle II experiment constitute the second-generation asymmetric energy B-factory. SuperKEKB has recently set a new world record in instantaneous luminosity, which is anticipated to further increase during the upcoming run periods up to $6\cdot 10^{35}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. An increase in luminosity is challenging for the track finding as it comes at the cost of a significant increase of the number of background hits. The Belle II experiment aims at testing the Standard Model of particle physics and searching for new physics by performing precision measurements. To achieve these physics goals, including e.g. time-dependent measurements, the track finding and fitting has to deliver tracks with high precision and efficiency. As the track reconstruction is part of the online high level trigger system of Belle II there are also stringent requirements on the resource usage.
  The Belle II tracking system consists of 2 layers of pixelated silicon detectors, 4 layers of double sided silicon strip detectors (SVD), and the central drift chamber. We will present the general performance and working of the track reconstruction algorithm of Belle II. In particular we will focus on the usage of hit time information from the silicon strip detector. The SVD has a very precise determination of the hit time, which will be used for the first time in the Belle II track finding in the next data taking period. These hit times are used for hit filtering, estimation of the time of collision, and the determination of the time of individual tracks. All of these are important tools to help to cope with the anticipated increase in background hits caused by the increase in luminosity.</description>

      <title>High efficiency veto hadron calorimeter in the NA64 experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NA64 is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS designed to search for Light particle Dark Matter (LDM) candidates with masses in the sub-GeV range. During the 2016-2022 runs, the experiment obtained the world-leading constraints, leaving however part of the well-motivated region of parameter space suggested by benchmark LDM models still unexplored. To further improve sensitivity, as part of the upgrades to the setup of NA64 at the CERN SPS H4 beamline, a prototype veto hadron calorimeter (VHCAL) was installed in the downstream region of the experiment during the 2023 run. The VHCAL, made of Cu-Sc layers, was expected to be an efficient veto against upstream electroproduction of large-angle hadrons or photon-nuclear interactions, reducing the background from secondary particles escaping the detector acceptance. With the collected statistics of $4.4\times10^{11}$ electrons on target (EOT), we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by rejecting this background by more than an order of magnitude. This result provides an essential input for designing a full-scale optimized VHCAL to continue running background-free during LHC Run 4, when we expect to collect $10^{13}$ EOT. Furthermore, this technique combined with improvements in the analysis enables us to decrease our missing energy threshold from 50 GeV to 40 GeV thereby enhancing the signal sensitivity of NA64.</description>

      <title>Muon identification with Deep Neural Network in the Belle II K-Long and Muon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon identification is crucial for elementary particle physics experiments. At the Belle II experiment, muons and pions with momenta greater than 0.7 GeV/c are distinguished by their penetration ability through the $K_L$ and Muon (KLM) sub-detector, which is the outermost sub-detector of Belle II. In this paper, we first discuss the possible room for $\mu/\pi$ identification performance improvement and then present a new method based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). This DNN model utilizes the KLM hit pattern variables as the input and thus can digest the penetration information better than the current algorithm. We test the new method in simulation and find that the pion fake rate is reduced from 4.1% to 1.6% at a muon efficiency of 90%.</description>

      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo Detector Tomography applied to a NbTiN nanobridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient 120nm wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.02)\times10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and a multi-photon (more than 2) internal quantum efficiency $p_{\ge 2}=1.0$.</description>

      <title>Influence of tip materials on the friction force microscopy of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001): comparison of diamond and silicon tips in experiments and atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction force microscopy (FFM) with silicon tips on epitaxial graphene supported by SiC(0001) previously revealed a sharp increase in friction at a threshold normal force, linked to the intermittent rehybridization of graphene and the formation of single-layer diamond above 12 GPa. In this study, the FFM behavior of a diamond tip is compared with that of the silicon tip. The diamond tip exhibited a similar abrupt increase in friction, but the threshold normal force was approximately twice as high for comparable tip radii. Simulations of graphene on SiC(0001) sliding against hydroxylated amorphous carbon (a-C) and silicon oxide (SiO2) slabs show that both systems exhibit low shear stress at low pressures, which increases at higher pressures due to bond formation between the graphene and counter slabs. The pressure dependence differs slightly: SiO2 reaches a shear stress plateau around 6 GPa, while a-C continues to increase gradually. For a-C, the transition threshold shifts to higher pressures, consistent with FFM results. Temperature lowers the transition threshold significantly, while sliding velocity has minimal impact on shear stress. These findings provide insights into the stability of low-friction interfaces between epitaxial graphene and the key materials which come into contact with graphene in current micro-electro-mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Development of a Test System for Data Links of the ATLAS Inner Tracker (ITk) Upgrade Silicon Pixel Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a novel test system developed to evaluate the signal transmission quality in high-speed data links for the 2026 Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade of the ATLAS experiment. Using an FPGA-based data acquisition (DAQ) framework, the setup can run simultaneous Bit Error Rate (BER) tests for up to 64 channels and generate virtual eye diagrams, for qualifying the $\sim$26k electrical links at the ATLAS ITk data rate of 1.28Gb/s. The paper includes results from system calibration, yielding its contribution to the measured losses, and preliminary results from tests of prototype and pre-production assemblies of on-detector links of the three ATLAS ITk Pixel subsystems.</description>
