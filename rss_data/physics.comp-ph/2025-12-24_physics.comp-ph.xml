      <title>URANOS -- a novel voxel engine Neutron Transport Monte-Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: URANOS is a newly developed 3D neutron transport Monte-Carlo code from thermal to fast energy domains. It was originally developed for the CASCADE detector. The purpose of this simulation program is to provide a fast computational workflow and an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for small to medium-sized projects. It features a ray-casting algorithm based on a voxel engine. The simulation domain is defined layerwise, whereas the geometry is extruded from a pixel matrix of materials, identified by specific numbers. Input files are a stack of pictures, all other settings, including the configuration of predefined sources, can be adjusted via the GUI. The scattering kernel features the treatment of elastic and inelastic collisions, absorption and absorption-like processes like evaporation. Cross sections, energy distributions and angular distributions are taken from evaluated data bases. In order to simulate boron-lined detectors it also models the charged particle transport following the conversion by computing the energy loss in the boron and its consecutive layer. The electron track is then projected onto a readout unit by longitudinal and transversal diffusion. URANOS is freely available and can be used to simulate the response function of boron-lined or epithermal neutron detectors, small-scale laboratory setups and especially transport studies of cosmic-ray induced environmental neutrons. It offers an easy accessibility and comparably simple interface capable of handling complex geometries. URANOS therefore offers possibilities to understand and simulate the neutron environment at instruments, which would otherwise require extensive modeling and training on dedicated packages.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Investigation of Mass Transport During Evaporation for the Binary System of n-Dodecane and Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interfacial fluxes under evaporative or condensation processes are ubiquitous in thermal systems, propulsion devices, and many other engineering applications. Most continuum scale models fail to capture the true nature of thermodynamic property variation across the interface, particularly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. An improvement over the sharp interface assumption of such continuum scale models is the consideration of a diffused interface and using Kinetic Boundary Conditions (KBCs) to model the mass-transport across the liquid vapor interface. Prior studies on KBCs mainly address monoatomic fluids. Two of the main ingredients required to form KBCs are: density and mass flux. Here, we study a Type-III binary mixture of n-dodecane and nitrogen using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics at near-critical temperatures. Interfacial properties such as thickness, density gradient, and surface tension were analyzed. A key result is the temporal evolution of the evaporation and reflected mass fluxes across the vapor-liquid interface. We observe that both the evaporation and reflection fluxes increase with increasing temperature, indicating enhanced molecular activity and mass transport across the interface at higher Tr. In contrast, the evaporation coefficient alpha_evap decreases from about alpha approximately 0.978 at Tr equals 0.70 to alpha approximately 0.905 at Tr equals 0.95 because the reflected-out flux increases along with the evaporation flux, which reduces the net efficiency of molecular evaporation across the interface. To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the very few studies estimating mass transport coefficients for Type-III binary systems, laying the foundation for KBCs in hydrocarbon and nitrogen mixtures.</description>

      <title>An immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modeling and simulation of fluid-structure interactions constitute a fundamental cornerstone for advancing aerospace engineering endeavors. This paper addresses the notion and implementation of the immersed boundary method for the discrete velocity model of the Boltzmann equation. The method incorporates the Maxwell gas-surface interaction model into the construction of ghost-cell particle distribution functions, facilitating meticulous characterization of velocity slip and temperature jump effects within a Cartesian grid framework, which ultimately achieves accurate prediction of aerodynamic parameters. This study presents two principal advancements. First, an upwind-weighted compact interpolation strategy is developed in physical space, which ensures numerical stability and robustness for arbitrary geometries without relying on large stencils or normal-direction projections. Second, a cut-cell correction methodology is proposed in velocity space to address the degradation of quadrature accuracy caused by surface discontinuities. The resulting framework is equally applicable to both two- and three-dimensional problems without requiring any dimension-specific modifications. Rigorous analysis is provided to prove that the approach maintains second-order accuracy across both physical and velocity space, while ensuring robust numerical stability. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the solution algorithm achieves the designed accuracy and delivers precise predictions comparable to body-conformal solvers, while retaining the simplicity, flexibility, and scalability of the Cartesian grid method. The proposed approach provides a unified and physically consistent immersed boundary framework for simulating dynamic interactions between non-equilibrium flows and structural components across a wide range of flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Modeling for Tsunami Forecasting with Bayesian Hierarchical Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.</description>

      <title>Climate change impacts on supra-permafrost soil and aquifer hydrology: broader, deeper, and longer activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal dynamics and hydrology of active layer soils and supra-permafrost aquifers determine the fate of the vast pool of carbon that they hold. In permafrost watersheds of Arctic Alaska, air temperature has warmed by up to 3.5 {\deg}C and snowfall has increased by up to ~40 mm from 1981 to 2020. How these changes impact the seasonal to decadal hydrological activity of the carbon-rich aquifers is mostly unknown. Observation-informed thermal hydrology modeling of a hillslope drained by a headwater stream (Imnavait Creek) within continuous permafrost showed profound changes from 1981 to 2020. Warmer summer temperatures deepened annual thaw depths. Steadily warming winter air temperatures, heavier snowfall, and stored energy from summer increased annual water outflow from the hillslope aquifer to the stream, warmed soil temperatures, and expanded and prolonged zero-curtain (stable at 0 {\deg}C) zones. In 2017-2018, zero-curtain areas with liquid water persisted through winter. Our findings reveal that both summer and winter warming drive year-round aquifer dynamics, creating conditions that amplify the permafrost-carbon-climate feedback.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Weight Window Method for Global Time-Dependent Monte Carlo Particle Transport Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm for time-dependent particle transport problems with global variance reduction based on automatic weight windows (WWs). The centers of WWs at a time step are defined by the solution of an auxiliary hybrid MC / deterministic problem formed by the low-order second-moment (LOSM) equations. The closures for the hybrid LOSM equations are calculated by the MC method. The LOSM equations are discretized by a scheme of the second-order accuracy in time and space. Filtering techniques are applied to reduce noise effects in the LOSM closures. The WWs defined with the auxiliary solution give rise to sufficiently uniform MC particle distribution in space on each time step. The algorithm is analyzed by means of an analytic transport benchmark. We study performance of the MC algorithm depending on a set parameters of WWs. Figure of merit and relative error results are presented, demonstrating the performance of the hybrid MC method and quantifying its computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Chaos and Defect Proliferation in Polar-Apolar Active Mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic transitions in inertial fluids typically proceed through a direct energy cascade from large to small scales. In contrast, active systems, composed of self propelled units, inject energy at microscopic scales and therefore exhibit an inverse cascade, giving rise to distinctly unconventional flow patterns. Here, we investigate an active mixture consisting of both apolar and polar self driven components, a setting expected to display richer behaviours than those found in living liquid crystal (LLC) systems, where the apolar constituent is passive. Using numerical solutions of the corresponding hydrodynamic equations, we uncover a variety of complex dynamical states. Our results reveal a non-monotonic response of the apolar species to changes in the density and activity of the polar component. In an intermediate regime, reminiscent of LLC-induced disorder, the system develops a dynamically disordered phase characterised by high-density, chaotically evolving band-like structures and by the continual creation and annihilation of half integer topological defects. We show that this regime exhibits spatiotemporal chaos, which we quantify through two complementary measures: the spectral properties of density fluctuations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Together, these findings broaden the understanding of complex transitions in active matter and suggest potential experimental realisations in bacterial suspensions or synthetic microswimmer assemblies.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Thermally-Assisted-Occupation Density Functional Theory, Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics, and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] has been demonstrated to be an efficient and accurate electronic structure method for studying the ground-state properties of large multi-reference (MR) systems at absolute zero. To explore the thermal equilibrium properties of large MR systems at finite electronic temperatures, in the present work, we propose the finite-temperature (FT) extension of TAO-DFT, denoted as FT-TAO-DFT. Besides, to unlock the dynamical information of large MR systems at finite temperatures, FT-TAO-DFT is combined with ab initio molecular dynamics, leading to FT-TAO-AIMD. In addition, we also develop FT-TAO-DFT-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), denoted as FT-TAO-QM/MM, to provide a cost-effective description of the thermal equilibrium properties of a QM subsystem with MR character embedded in an MM environment at finite temperatures. Moreover, the FT-TAO-DFT, FT-TAO-AIMD, and FT-TAO-QM/MM methods are employed to explore the radical nature and infrared (IR) spectra of n-acenes (n = 2--6), consisting of n linearly fused benzene rings, in vacuum and in an argon (Ar) matrix at finite temperatures. According to our calculations, for n-acenes at 1000 K or below, the electronic temperature effects on the radical nature and IR spectra are very minor, while the nuclear temperature effects on these properties are noticeable. For n-acene in an Ar matrx at absolute zero, the Ar matrix has minimal impact on the radical nature of n-acene, while the co-deposition procedure of n-acene and Ar atoms may affect the IR spectrum of n-acene.</description>

      <title>GeoTransolver: Learning Physics on Irregumar Domains Using Multi-scale Geometry Aware Physics Attention Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.</description>

      <title>Topological resolution of conical intersection seams and the coupled cluster bifurcation via mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rigorous description of Conical Intersections (CIs) remains the central challenge of non-adiabatic quantum chemistry. While the ``Yarkony Seam'' -- the $(3N-8)$-dimensional manifold of degeneracy -- is well-understood geometrically, its accurate characterization by high-level electronic structure methods is plagued by numerical instabilities. Specifically, standard Coupled Cluster (CC) theory suffers from root bifurcations near Ground State CIs, rendering the ``Gold Standard'' of chemistry inapplicable where it is needed most. Here, we present \textbf{QuMorpheus}, an open-source computational package that resolves these singularities by implementing a topological framework based on Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM) [P. Saurabh, arXiv:2512.19487 (2025)]. By algorithmically mapping the CC polynomial equations to a spectral sheaf, we compute the exact Monodromy ($\mu$) invariants of the intersection. We demonstrate that this automated algebraic geometry approach correctly identifies the physical ground state topology in the K\"{o}hn-Tajti model and resolves the intersection seams of realistic chemical systems, including Ethylene and the Chloronium ion ($\mathrm{H_2Cl^+}$). Furthermore, we apply QuMorpheus to the photoisomerization of Previtamin D, proving that the experimentally observed Woodward-Hoffmann selection rules are a direct consequence of a topological ``Monodromy Wall'' ($\mu=1, \gamma=\pi$) rather than purely energetic barriers. This establishes a general software solution to the ``Yarkony Problem,'' enabling the robust, automated mapping of global intersection seams in complex molecular systems. The topological stability of these intersections allows for the control protocols discussed in Ref.[P. Saurabh, Submitted to Phys. Rev. X (2025)].</description>

      <title>Iterative learning scheme for crystal structure prediction with anharmonic lattice dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles based crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods have revealed an essential tool for the discovery of new materials. However, in solids close to displacive phase transitions, which are common in ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, charge-density wave systems, or superconducting hydrides, the ionic contribution to the free energy and lattice anharmonicity become essential, limiting the capacity of CSP techniques to determine the thermodynamical stability of competing phases. While variational methods like the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) accurately account for anharmonic lattice dynamics \emph{ab initio}, their high computational cost makes them impractical for CSP. Machine-learning interatomic potentials offer accelerated sampling of the energy landscape compared to purely first-principles approaches, but their reliance on extensive training data and limited generalization restricts practical applications. Here, we propose an iterative learning framework combining evolutionary algorithms, atomic foundation models, and SSCHA to enable CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics. Foundation models enable robust relaxations of random structures, drastically reducing required training data. Applied to the highly anharmonic H$_3$S system, our framework achieves good agreement with the benchmarks based on density functional theory, accurately predicting phase stability and vibrational properties from 50 to 200 GPa. Importantly, we find that the statistical averaging in the SSCHA reduces the error in the free energy evaluation, avoiding the need for extremely high accuracy of machine-learning potentials. This approach bridges the gap between data efficiency and predictive power, establishing a practical pathway for CSP with anharmonic lattice dynamics.</description>

Abstract: To compute approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems, we describe variational methods based on the product state (PS) and matrix product state (MPS) ansatzes. We perform variational energy minimization with respect to a quantum annealing Hamiltonian and utilize randomness by embedding the approaches in the metaheuristic iterated local search (ILS). The resulting quantum-inspired ILS algorithms are benchmarked on maximum cut problems of up to 50000 variables. We show that they can outperform traditional (M)PS methods, classical ILS, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and other variational quantum-inspired solvers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive sampling accelerates the hybrid deviational particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To avoid ineffective collisions between the equilibrium states, the hybrid method with deviational particles (HDP) has been proposed to integrate the Vlasov-Poisson-Landau system, while leaving a new issue in sampling deviational particles from the high-dimensional source term. In this paper, we present an adaptive sampling (AS) strategy that first adaptively reconstructs a piecewise constant approximation of the source term based on sequential clustering via discrepancy estimation, and then samples deviational particles directly from the resulting adaptive piecewise constant function without rejection. The mixture discrepancy, which can be easily calculated thanks to its explicit analytical expression, is employed as a measure of uniformity instead of the star discrepancy the calculation of which is NP-hard. The resulting method, dubbed the HDP-AS method, samples deviational particles through adaptive sampling instead of the acceptance-rejection method in the original HDP method. In the Landau damping, two stream instability, bump on tail and Rosenbluth's test problems, the HDP-AS method runs approximately ten times faster than the HDP method while keeping the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Informed Method of Lines for Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid solver that fuses the dimensionality-reduction strengths of the Method of Lines (MOL) with the flexibility of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Instead of approximating spatial derivatives with fixed finite-difference stencils - whose truncation errors force extremely fine meshes - our method trains a neural network to represent the initial spatial profile and then employs automatic differentiation to obtain spectrally accurate gradients at arbitrary nodes. These high-fidelity derivatives define the right-hand side of the MOL-generated ordinary-differential system, and time integration is replaced with a secondary temporal PINN while spatial accuracy is retained without mesh refinement. The resulting "boundary-informed MOL-PINN" matches or surpasses conventional MOL in accuracy using an order of magnitude fewer collocation points, thereby shrinking memory footprints, lessening dependence on large data sets, and increasing complexity robustness. Because it relies only on automatic differentiation and standard optimizers, the framework extends naturally to linear and nonlinear PDEs in any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems</title>

Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller,``local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of ``local hardness", i.e., the complexity of predicting local properties of the solution from local information, for the ground-state problem of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related frustrated spin systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors are intimately connected to global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the computationally much more expensive global minimization. We leverage these findings to introduce a heuristic contraction-based algorithm for globally studying spin-glass ground states. The local solvers further display sharp imprints of the phase transition from the spin-glass to the ferromagnetic phase as the distribution of spin-glass couplings is shifted, as well as characteristic differences for the infinite-range model, implying the existence of specific classes of local hardness. Our findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic structure underpins advances in chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the development of powerful surrogate models that can enable the prediction of the ground state electron density and related properties at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional first principles simulations. Such ML models typically rely on massive datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculations. A key reason for relying on such large datasets is the lack of prior knowledge about which portions of the data are essential, and which are redundant. This study reveals significant redundancies in electronic structure datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and chemically complex alloys -- challenging the notion that extensive datasets are essential for accurate ML-based electronic structure predictions. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy that selects data across all learning difficulties, retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data, while reducing training time by threefold or greater. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate easy-to-learn data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors due to significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning physics-informed neural networks for cavity flows using coordinate transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an alternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep neural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve inverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it remains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with an arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential solution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow condition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes a fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling lid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem, where the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are given. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is used to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with different targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with coordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical examples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, shear deformed and inflated geometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the training convergence compared with a randomly-initialized model. A pre-trained model with a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency. These findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling intra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.</description>

      <title>Edge-of-chaos enhanced quantum-inspired algorithm for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. Numerical simulations of them are also useful as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve surprisingly high performance, namely, almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by physics-inspired approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</description>

      <title>Fourth branch of instability of Stokes' wave and dependence of corresponding growth rate on nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through a massive computation we reached the fourth superharmonic instability branch of the Stokes' wave. Using the obtained results we checked phenomenological formulae for the dependence of the instability growth rates corresponding to different branches of instability on the nonlinearity parameter (steepness, defined as the wave \red{hight} to wavelength ratio $H/\Lambda$) in the vicinity of the new instability branch appearance and far from it. It is demonstrated, that the formulae, obtained as a least squares fit (using the information from the first three branches of instability) and a phenomenological asymptotics, work for the fourth branch as well. Range of applicability of the relations \red{is} corrected. \red{This result removes the necessity to compute further branches of instability if accuracy better than 10\% for the growth rate is acceptable.} Growth rates for all four instability branches are reported.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Fourier-Enhanced Deep Operator Network for Spatio-Temporal Propagation in Multi-Mode Fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort-pulse propagation in graded-index multimode fibers is a highly nonlinear phenomenon driven by several physical processes. Although conventional numerical solvers can reproduce this behavior with high fidelity, their computational cost limits real-time prediction, rapid parameter exploration, experimental feedback, and especially inverse retrieval of input fields from measured outputs. In this work, we introduce an operator learning framework that learns both the forward and inverse propagation operators within a single unified architecture. By combining spectral filters for spatio-temporal representations with Fourier-embedded conditioning on physical parameters, the model functions as a fast surrogate capable of accurately predicting complex field evolution on previously unseen cases. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first demonstrations of a bidirectional operator-learning framework applied to ultrashort-pulse multimode fiber propagation. The resulting architecture enables orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers, paving the way for real-time beam diagnostics, data-driven design of complex input fields, and closed-loop spatio-temporal control. Moreover, the same framework can potentially be applied to a wide variety of wave systems exhibiting analogous nonlinear and dispersive effects in optics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved spectral functions of super-moir\'e systems using tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moir\'e systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moir\'e systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moir\'e systems, including super-moir\'e with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moir\'e patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moir\'e, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moir\'e systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moir\'e systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Gap-free Information Transfer in 4D-STEM via Fusion of Complementary Scattering Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.</description>
