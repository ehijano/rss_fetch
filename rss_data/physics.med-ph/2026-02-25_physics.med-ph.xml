      <title>Radiation damage to normal mammalian tissue in vivo with laser-driven protons at ultra-high instantaneous dose rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential sparing of normal tissues relative to tumor control observed at ultra-high dose rates, referred to as the FLASH effect, has recently gained considerable attention. The therapeutic advantages of FLASH radiotherapy are expected to be further amplified through the use of protons and ions, which enable precise dose deposition at tumor depth while minimizing irradiation of healthy tissues proximal and distal to the target. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying this sparing effect remains poorly understood. Laser-driven proton accelerators are capable of delivering uniquely high instantaneous dose rates in ultrashort bunches. Here, we report the first in vivo investigation of normal tissue response to laser-driven proton irradiation. Our findings reveal a reduction in tissue swelling following laser-driven proton treatment compared with X-ray irradiations at conventional dose rates. RNA sequencing identified differential gene expression associated with immune and epidermal programs following laser-driven proton irradiations at two different dose levels.</description>

      <title>On the calculation of the radiobiological effect of radiolytic oxygen depletion in FLASH radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD) may play a role in the sparing of cells irradiated with ultra-high dose rates. Different methods have been used to quantify the effect of ROD during FLASH irradiation on cell survival, typically involving some kind of averaging of the oxygen effect and the LQ model. In this work, we compare the results obtained with several of these methods and introduce a novel method based on the non-linear differential form of the LQ model.
  Approach: We present a novel method to account for a varying oxygen concentration on the dose-response based on the non-linear differential form of the LQ model, and we compare the results obtained with this method with those obtained with other methods that linearize the averaging of the oxygen effect during irradiation.
  Main results: We found differences in the surviving fractions obtained with the method introduced in this work and other methods that introduce different linearizations (averaging) of the non-linear dependence on the oxygen concentration, especially for oxygenations and doses that lead to important changes in the OERs during the delivery of the dose (initial oxygenations $\approx$5--10 mmHg and doses $&gt;30$~Gy). On the other hand, we showed that the method presented by Zhu \emph{et al.} is equivalent to a first-order Euler numerical method of the differential LQ model.
  Significance: The method introduced in this work and the method of Zhu \emph{et al.} may allow a more precise quantification of the effect of ROD on dose-response, both for tumors and normal tissues. While all the reviewed methods show an oxygen-dependent sparing effect of FLASH radiotherapy driven by ROD and qualitatively similar results, the method introduced in this work and that of Zhu \emph{et al.} may be more suitable to quantitatively analyze new preclinical (and future clinical) data coming from experimental studies.</description>

      <title>A physics inspired and efficient transform for optoacoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optoacoustic imaging technologies require fast and accurate signal pre-processing algorithms to enable widespread deployment in clinical and home-care settings. However, they still rely on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the default tool for essential signal-conditioning operations, which imposes hard limits on both execution speed and signal-retrieval accuracy. Here, we present a new transform whose building blocks are directly inspired by the physics of optoacoustic signal generation. We compared its performance with the DFT and other classical transforms on common signal-processing tasks using both simulations and experimental datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed transform not only sets a new lower bound on computational complexity relative to the DFT, but also substantially outperforms classical transforms on basic signal-processing operations in terms of accuracy. We expect this transform to catalyze broader adoption of optoacoustic methods.</description>
