      <title>On Zero Energy States in SUSY Quantum Mechanics on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero modes of the operator $H_f=D^*_fD_f$, with a Dirac type operator $D_f$, acting on the spinor bundle over a closed even dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$. The operator $D_f=D+ifI$ is a deformation of the Dirac operator $D$ by a smooth function $f$. We obtain sufficient conditions on the deformation function that guarantee the positivity of the operator $H_f$, that is, the absence of zero modes. We also show that these conditions are not necessary and provide an explicit counterexample of a zero mode of the operator $H_f$.</description>

      <title>A Jensen inequality for partial traces and applications to partially semiclassical limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a matrix inequality for convex functions of a Hermitian matrix on a bipartite space. As an application we reprove and extend some theorems about eigenvalue asymptotics of Schr\"odinger operators with homogeneous potentials. The case of main interest is where the Weyl expression is infinite and a partially semiclassical limit occurs.</description>

      <title>Exact physical quantities of the $D_2^{(2)}$ spin chain model with generic open boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the twisted $D_2^{(2)}$ algebra (or simply the $D_2^{(2)}$ model) under generic open boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian of this model can be factorized into the sum of two staggered XXZ spin chains. Applying the $t$-$W$ method, we derive the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations for the zeros of the transfer matrix eigenvalues and the patterns of the corresponding zeros of the staggered XXZ spin chain with generic integrable boundaries. Based on these results, we analytically compute the surface energies and excitation energies of the $D_2^{(2)}$ model in different regimes of boundary parameters.</description>

      <title>The bilinear fermionic form for KP and BKP hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a tau-function of the KP or BKP hierarchy, we introduce the notion of lifting operator and derive an equation connecting the corresponding fermionic two-point function and fermionic one-point function through the lifting operator. This provides an effective approach to determine the fermionic two-point function of the tau-function from the lifting operator and the fermionic one-point function. As practical applications, we derive concise formulas for the fermionic two-point functions of several models, like the $r$-spin model and the Br{\' e}zin--Gross--Witten model, which respectively serve as examples for KP and BKP tau-functions.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations and 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories beyond Toric Fano 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of birational transformations that relate toric Fano 3-folds defined by reflexive lattice polytopes can be identified with mass deformations of corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. These theories are realized by a Type IIA brane configuration known as brane brick models. We further show that the same family of birational transformations extends to more general toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, including those defined by non-reflexive toric diagrams. Under these birational transformations, the mesonic moduli spaces of the associated abelian 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories and brane brick models share the same number of generators and the same Hilbert series when refined only under the U(1)R symmetry. Since these transformations categorize toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds and their corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories into non-trivial equivalence classes, we anticipate that our findings will pave the way for a `Minimal Model Program' for quiver gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: \textit{Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics?} This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints from information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and obeying any statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this, we obtain the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ and the system energy of the black hole as its thermal energy: $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Waves and Edge Eigenvectors of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backhausz and Szegedy (2019) demonstrated that the almost eigenvectors of random regular graphs converge to Gaussian waves with variance $0\leq \sigma^2\leq 1$. In this paper, we present an alternative proof of this result for the edge eigenvectors of random regular graphs, establishing that the variance must be $\sigma^2=1$. Furthermore, we show that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are asymptotically independent. Our approach introduces a simple framework linking the weak convergence of the imaginary part of the Green's function to the convergence of eigenvectors, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Tail Profile of Bulk Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos Measures I: Bulk/Boundary Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a series of papers devoted to studying the right tail profile of a bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure with uniform singularity on the boundary. We investigate the bulk/boundary quotients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures appearing in boundary Liouville conformal field theory, for which we establish preliminary joint moment bounds. These moment bounds will be a crucial ingredient in establishing the right tail profile of the bulk Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure in subsequent papers. The main idea is to implement the so-called localization trick at the boundary, and we also record a useful generalization of Kahane's convexity inequality, which is of independent interest. The study of the universal tail profiles of general bulk measures and bulk/boundary quotients as well as connections to integrability results of boundary Liouville conformal field theory will be pursued in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Oscillons from $Q$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. For potentials with a nonzero cubic or quartic term the universal $Q$-ball theory is well approximated by the integrable complex sine-Gordon model. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. Concretely, we explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-Q-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.</description>

      <title>Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations in four spacetime dimensions. Our proof relies on a zero-shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scalar field equations. To synchronise the big bang singularity, we use the time coordinate $\tau = \exp\bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi\bigr)$, where $\phi$ is the scalar field, which coincides with a conformal harmonic time slicing. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities located at $\tau=0$, which are characterised by curvature blow up. Specifically, we establish two stability theorems. The first is a global in-space stability result where the perturbed spacetimes are of the form $M =\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \tau^{-1}(\{t\}) \cong (0,t_0] \times \mathbb{T}^{3}$. The second is a localised version where the perturbed spacetimes are given by $M=\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]}\tau^{-1}(\{t\})\cong \bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \{t\}\times\mathbb{B}_{\rho(t)}$ with time-dependent radius function $\rho(t)=\rho_0+(1-\vartheta)\rho_0\bigl(\bigl(\frac{t}{t_0}\bigr)^{1-\epsilon}-1\bigr)$. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed.</description>

      <title>The number of monotone trapezoids with prescribed bottom row</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an operator formula for the number of monotone trapezoids with prescribed bottom row, generalizing alternating sign matrices. The special case of the formula for monotone triangles previously provided an alternative proof for the enumeration of alternating sign matrices and led to several results on alternating sign triangles and alternating sign trapezoids. The generalization presented in this paper reveals an additional ``hidden operator'' that is annihilated in the special case of monotone triangles, whose discovery was a major challenge.
  The enumeration formula is conceptually simple: it applies, in addition to the newly discovered hidden operator, an operator ensuring row strictness to the formula for the number of Gelfand--Tsetlin trapezoids. Notably, the top row of the monotone trapezoid is not prescribed. Thus, our result involves a free boundary, which is a novel situation in this area. We also uncover an unexpected relation to the coinvariant algebra and propose a conjecture on its generalization.</description>

      <title>Domain Overlapping Algorithm with Nonlinear Mapping for Collocation-Based Solutions of Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents four novel domain decomposition algorithms integrated with nonlinear mapping techniques to address collocation-based solutions of eigenvalue problems involving sharp interfaces or steep gradients. The proposed methods leverage the spectral accuracy of Chebyshev polynomials while overcoming limitations of existing tools like Chebfun, particularly in preserving higher-order derivative continuity and enabling flexible node clustering near discontinuities. Key findings include the following: for algorithm Performance: The one-point overlap method demonstrated significant improvements over global mapping approaches, reducing required grid points by orders of magnitude while maintaining spectral convergence. The two-point overlap method further methods generalized the approach, allowing arbitrary node distributions and nonlinear mappings. These achieved exponential error reduction for Burgers equation) by combining Taylor expansions with Chebyshev derivatives in overlap regions. While Chebfun splitting strategy automates domain decomposition, it enforces only C0 continuity, leading to discontinuous higher derivatives. In contrast, the proposed algorithms preserved smoothness up to CN continuity, critical for eigenvalue problems in hydrodynamic stability and nonlinear BVPs. Validation on 3D channel flow with viscosity stratification and Burgers equation highlighted the methods robustness. For instance, eigenvalue calculations for miscible core-annular flows matched prior results while resolving sharp viscosity gradients with fewer nodes.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particles with 1D Coulomb interaction: the active jellium model and the non-reciprocal self-gravitating gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently we studied $N$ run-and-tumble particles in one dimension - which switch with rate $\gamma$ between driving velocities $\pm v_0$ - interacting via the long range 1D Coulomb potential (also called rank interaction), both in the attractive and in the repulsive case, with and without a confining potential. We extend this study in two directions. First we consider the same system, but inside a harmonic confining potential, which we call "active jellium". We obtain a parametric representation of the particle density in the stationary state at large $N$, which we analyze in detail. Contrary to the linear potential, there is always a steady-state where the density has a bounded support. However, we find that the model still exhibits transitions between phases with different behaviors of the density at the edges, ranging from a continuous decay to a jump, or even a shock (i.e. a cluster of particles, which manifests as a delta peak in the density). Notably, the interactions forbid a divergent density at the edges, which may occur in the non-interacting case. In the second part, we consider a non-reciprocal version of the rank interaction: the $+$ particles (of velocity $+v_0$) are attracted towards the $-$ particles (of velocity $-v_0$) with a constant force $b/N$, while the $-$ particles are repelled by the $+$ particles with a force of same amplitude. In order for a stationary state to exist we add a linear confining potential. We derive an explicit expression for the stationary density at large $N$, which exhibits an explicit breaking of the mirror symmetry with respect to $x=0$. This again shows the existence of several phases, which differ by the presence or absence of a shock at $x=0$, with one phase even exhibiting a vanishing density on the whole region $x&gt;0$. Our analytical results are complemented by numerical simulations for finite $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies quantitative homogenization of elliptic equations with random, uniformly elliptic coefficients that vanish in a union of random holes. Assuming an upper bound on the size of the holes and a separation condition between them, we derive optimal bounds for the regularity radius $r_*$ and suboptimal growth estimates for the corrector. These results are key ingredients for error analysis in stochastic homogenization and serve as crucial input for recent developments in the double-porosity model, such as those by Bonhomme, Duerinckx, and Gloria (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02847).</description>

      <title>Nonmodal amplitude equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fluid flows for which the linearized Navier-Stokes operator is strongly non-normal. The responses of such flows to external perturbations are spanned by a generically very large number of (non-orthogonal) eigenmodes. They are therefore qualified as ``nonmodal" responses, to insist on the inefficiency of the eigenbasis to describe them. For the purpose of this article to reduce the dimension of the system in a weakly nonlinear regime, (eigen)modal reduction techniques, such as the center manifold, are thus inappropriate precisely because the leading-order dynamics cannot be restricted to a low-dimensional eigensubspace. On the other hand, it is often true that only a small number (we assume one) of singular modes is sufficient to reconstruct the nonmodal responses at the leading order. By adopting the latter paradigm, we propose a method to analytically derive a weakly nonlinear amplitude equation for the nonmodal response of a fluid flow to a small harmonic forcing, stochastic forcing, and initial perturbation, respectively. The present approach is simpler than the one we previously proposed, for neither the operator perturbation nor the ensuing compatibility condition were formally necessary. When applied to the stochastic response, the present method makes it possible to derive an amplitude equation that is substantially easier to solve than the one we proposed previously. Despite being concerned with the response to external disturbances of three different natures, the derivations of the amplitude equations all proceed by the same general principle. Eventually, the three derived amplitude equations are tested in three distinct flows. At extremely low numerical cost as compared to fully nonlinear techniques, they can predict the weakly nonlinear modification of the gains as the flow departs from the linear regime by increasing the amplitude of the external excitation.</description>

      <title>The Eigenfunctions of the Transfer Operator for the Dyson model in a field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent works \cite{EFMV2024} and \cite{JOP2023} have studied the spectral properties of the Dyson model in the absence of an external field. This paper is a continuation of \cite{EFMV2024} and aims to bridge the gap in the literature by investigating the Dyson model in a field.\\ In this paper, we prove that, for high temperatures or strong magnetic fields, there exists a non-negative, integrable (with respect to the unique half-line Gibbs measure) eigenfunction of the transfer operator for the Dyson model if $\alpha\in(\frac 3 2,2]$. However, unlike in the zero-magnetic-field case, this eigenfunction is not continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a set of axioms for locally topologically ordered quantum spin systems in terms of nets of local ground state projections, and we show they are satisfied by Kitaev's Toric Code and Levin-Wen type models. For a locally topologically ordered spin system on $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$, we define a local net of boundary algebras on $\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}$, which provides a mathematically precise algebraic description of the holographic dual of the bulk topological order. We construct a canonical quantum channel so that states on the boundary quasi-local algebra parameterize bulk-boundary states without reference to a boundary Hamiltonian. As a corollary, we obtain a new proof of a recent result of Ogata [Ann. H. Poincar\'e 25, 2024] that the bulk cone von Neumann algebra in the Toric Code is of type $\rm{II}$, and we show that Levin-Wen models can have cone algebras of type $\rm{III}$. Finally, we argue that the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules for the net of boundary algebras characterizes the bulk topological order in (2+1)D, and can also be used to characterize the topological order of boundary states.</description>

      <title>The one-dimensional Coulomb Hamiltonian: Properties of its Birman-Schwinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Birman-Schwinger operator for a self-adjoint realisation of the one-dimensional Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential. We study both the case in which this Hamiltonian is defined on the whole real line and when it is only defined on the positive semiaxis. In both cases, the Birman-Schwinger operator is Hilbert-Schmidt, even though it is not trace class. Then, we have considered some approximations to the Hamiltonian depending on a positive parameter, under given conditions, and proved the convergence of the Birman-Schwinger operators of these approximations to the original Hamiltonian as the parameter goes to zero. Further comments and results have been included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well-known, a conformal class of a surface $M$ with boundary $\Gamma$ is determined by its DN map $\Lambda$. In the paper, the algorithm for determination of the $b$-period matrix $\mathbb{B}$ of the (Schottky) double of surface with boundary via $\Lambda$ is presented. Due to the Torelli theorem, $\mathbb{B}$ contains all information on the conformal class of $M$ except the proper way of attaching $\Gamma$ to it.</description>

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from conserved current, application to massive scalar boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method applies to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. Due to the one-to-one correspondence between (covariant) achronal localizations and (covariant) representations of the causal logic thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly one derives the covariant family of representations of the causal logic related to the stress energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. While reaching this result the divergence theorem is proven for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary.</description>

Abstract: Let $T=(\C^*)^k$ act on $V=\C^N$ faithfully and preserving the volume form, i.e. $(\C^*)^k \into \text{SL}(V)$. On the B-side, we have toric stacks $Z_W$ (see Eq. \ref{eq:ZW})labelled by walls $W$ in the GKZ fan, and $Z_{/F}$ labelled by faces of a polytope corresponding to minimal semi-orthogonal decomposition (SOD) components. The B-side multiplicity $n^B_{W,F}$, well-defined by a result of Kite-Segal \cite{kite-segal}, is the number of times $\Coh(Z_{/F})$ appears in a complete SOD of $\Coh(Z_W)$. On the A-side, we have the GKZ discriminant loci components $\nabla_F \In (\C^*)^k$, and its tropicalization $\nabla^{trop}_{F} \In \R^k$. The A-side multiplicity $n^A_{W, F}$ is defined as the multiplicity of the tropical complex $\nabla^{trop}_{F}$ on wall $W$. We prove that $n^A_{W,F} = n^B_{W,F}$, confirming a conjecture in Kite-Segal \cite{kite-segal} inspired by \cite{aspinwall2017mirror}. Our proof is based on the result of Horja-Katzarkov \cite{horja2022discriminants} and a lemma about B-side SOD multiplicity, which allows us to reduce to lower dimension just as in A-side \cite{GKZ-book}[Ch 11].</description>

      <title>Large-time behavior of the 2D thermally non-diffusive Boussinesq equations with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the large-time behavior of a buoyancy-driven fluid without thermal diffusion under Navier-slip boundary conditions in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-continuous second derivatives. After establishing improved regularity for classical solutions, we analyze their large-time asymptotics. Specifically, we show that the solutions converge to a state where, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, $\|u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0$, and hydrostatic balance is achieved in the weak topology of $L^2$. Furthermore, we identify the necessary conditions under which stable stratification and hydrostatic balance can be achieved in the strong topology as time approaches infinity. We then analyze a particular steady state, the hydrostatic equilibrium, characterized by $ u = 0 $, $ \theta = \beta x_2 + \gamma $, and $ p = \frac{\beta}{2}x_2^2 + \gamma x_2 + \delta $. In a periodic strip, we establish the linear stability of this state for $\beta &gt; 0$, indicating that the temperature is vertically stably stratified. This work builds upon the results in [Doering et al.], which focus on free-slip boundary conditions, as well as recent studies [Ayd{\i}n, Kukavica, Ziane; Ayd{\i}n, Jayanti] that address no-slip boundary conditions. Notably, the novelty of this study lies in the ability to directly bound the pressure term, made possible by the Navier-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Models in Biology and Life Sciences: Sources, Developments, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocality is important in realistic mathematical models of physical and biological systems when local models fail to capture the essential dynamics and interactions that occur over a range of distances. This review illustrates different nonlocal mathematical models applied to biology and life sciences. The major focus has been given to sources, developments, and applications of such models. Among other things, a systematic discussion has been provided for the conditions of pattern formations in biological systems of population dynamics. Special attention has also been given to nonlocal interactions on networks, network coupling and integration, including brain dynamics models that provide an important tool to understand neurodegenerative diseases better. In addition, we have discussed nonlocal modelling approaches for cancer stem cells and tumor cells that are widely applied in the cell migration processes, growth, and avascular tumors in any organ. Furthermore, the discussed nonlocal continuum models can go sufficiently smaller scales, including nanotechnology, where classical local models often fail to capture the complexities of nanoscale interactions, applied to build biosensors to sense biomaterial and its concentration. Piezoelectric and other smart materials are among them, and these devices are becoming increasingly important in the digital and physical world that is intrinsically interconnected with biological systems. Additionally, we have reviewed a nonlocal theory of peridynamics, which deals with continuous and discrete media and applies to model the relationship between fracture and healing in cortical bone, tissue growth and shrinkage, and other areas increasingly important in biomedical and bioengineering applications. Finally, we provided a comprehensive summary of emerging trends and highlighted future directions in this rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In comparison with Derrida's REM, we investigate the influence of the so-called decoration processes arising in the limiting extremal processes of numerous log-correlated Gaussian fields. In particular, we focus on the branching Brownian motion and two specific quantities from statistical physics in the vicinity of the critical temperature. The first one is the two-temperature overlap, whose behavior at criticality is smoothened by the decoration process - unlike the one-temperature overlap which is identical - and the second one is the temperature susceptibility, as introduced by Sales and Bouchaud, which is strictly larger in the presence of decorations and diverges, close to the critical temperature, at the same speed as for the REM but with a different multiplicative constant. We also study some general decorated cases in order to highlight the fact that the BBM has a critical behavior in some sense to be made precise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks in the form of nearest-neighbor hopping on Erdos-Renyi random graphs of finite fixed mean degree c as the number of vertices N tends to infinity. In this regime, using statistical field theory methods, we develop an analytic theory of the first return time probability distribution. The problem turns out closely related to finding the spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian that controls the continuum time version of the nearest-neighbor-hopping random walk. In the infinite graph limit, where loops are highly improbable, the returns operate in a manner qualitatively similar to c-regular trees, and the expressions for probabilities resemble those on random c-regular graphs. Because the vertex degrees are not exactly constant, however, the way c enters the formulas differs from the dependence on the graph degree of first return probabilities on random regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

      <title>Unitarity bounds with subthreshold and anomalous cuts for $b$-hadron decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalisation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parametrization. Most form factors (FFs) in $b$-hadron decays exhibit additional branch cuts -- namely subthreshold and anomalous branch cuts -- beyond the ``standard'' unitarity cut. These additional cuts cannot be adequately accounted for by the BGL parametrization. For instance, these cuts arise in the FFs for $B\to D^{(*)}$, $B\to K^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda$ processes, which are particularly relevant from a phenomenological standpoint. We demonstrate how to parametrize such FFs and derive unitarity bounds in the presence of subthreshold and/or anomalous branch cuts. Our work paves the way for a wide range of new FF analyses based solely on first principles, thereby minimising systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Improving stabilizer approximation with quantum strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum strategy from nonlocal games to improve the stabilizer approximation we proposed previously. The resulting approach turns out to be a qubit-by-qubit gauging procedure for standard stabilizers, which could involve discrete or continuous gauge parameters. We take examples from many-body physics and quantum chemistry to show such a procedure leads to an improvement of the performance.</description>

      <title>Liouville Brownian motion and quantum cones in dimension $d &gt; 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $d &gt; 2$ and $\gamma \in (0, \sqrt{2d})$, we study the Liouville Brownian motion associated with the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We compute its spectral dimension, i.e., the short-time asymptotics of the heat kernel along the diagonal, which, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, depends on both $\gamma$ and on the thickness of the starting point. Furthermore, for even dimensions $d &gt; 2$, we show that the spherical average process of the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be identified with the integral of a stationary Gaussian Markov process of order $(d-2)/2$. Exploiting this representation, we construct the higher-dimensional analogue of the $\beta$-quantum cone for $\beta \in (-\infty, Q)$, with $Q = d/\gamma + \gamma/2$. Lastly, for $\alpha = Q - \sqrt{Q^2-4}$, we prove that the law of the $d$-dimensional $\alpha$-quantum cone is invariant under shifts along the trajectories of the associated Liouville Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize some results in our previous work on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>Gauge Origami and BPS/CFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\times \mathbb{C}^{4}$ and its BPS/CFT correspondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system arise from D0-branes bound to D$(2p)$-branes wrapping cycles in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is understood as an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten index of it produces the instanton partition function. We define a $q$-deformed quiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and introduce vertex operators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral formula for the Witten index has a nice free field realization. Such free field realization leads to the concept of BPS $qq$-characters or BPS quiver W-algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>
